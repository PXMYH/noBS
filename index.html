            <p>Trump may soon name pick for open Fed board seat and Fed chair nominee, but
Bessent wants to stay in current role

Donald Trump said he would “shortly” announce his pick for an open seat on the

governor Adriana Kugler had decided to leave her seat now instead of when her
term ends in January, a move that appears to have accelerated Trump’s decision

Donald Trump’s words and actions rarely align perfectly. If you watch
carefully, what he doesn’t say can be just as telling as what he does.

“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,

The former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioners and non-partisan

commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report data revealed jobs
growth stalled this summer.

Trump, without any evidence to back his claims, alleged McEntarfer “faked”
employment numbers in the run-up to the 2024 election to boost Kamala Harris’s
chances and said that the recent data was “rigged” to make Trump and
Republicans look bad.

for the world’s richest person.

Musk will pay $2bn to buy 96m shares in the electric carmaker at the same

recommendation from a “special committee” of the board.

In March 2020, about the time the Covid pandemic started, Christina Chapman, a
woman who lived in Arizona and Minnesota, received a message on LinkedIn
asking her to “be the US face” of a company and help overseas IT workers gain
remote employment.

As working from home became the norm for many people, Chapman was able to find
jobs for the foreign workers at hundreds of US companies, including some in
the Fortune 500, such as Nike; “a premier Silicon Valley technology company”;
and one of the “most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the
world”.

            <p>We must avoid inequalities between the global north and global south being
perpetuated in the digital age

I come from Trinidad and Tobago. As a country that was once colonized by the
British, I am wary of the ways that inequalities between the global north and
global south risk being perpetuated in the digital age.

When we consider the lack of inclusion of the global south in discussions
about artificial intelligence (AI), I think about how this translates to an
eventual lack of economic leverage and geopolitical engagement in this
technology that has captivated academics within the industrialised country I
reside, the United States.

The US’s largest companies have spent 2025 locked in a competition to spend
more money than one another, lavishing $155bn on the development of artificial
intelligence, more than the US government has spent on education, training,
employment and social services in the 2025 fiscal year so far.

Based on the most recent financial disclosures of Silicon Valley’s biggest
players, the race is about to accelerate to hundreds of billions in a single

According to Donald Trump’s White House, the US economy is booming, inflation
is dead and jobs are surging. A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall
on such claims in recent days.

This week’s data on Trump’s early economic record was mixed – good, mad and
ugly – with jobs numbers so weak he reached for the catchphrase he once used
to build himself into a reality TV star: you’re fired.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
