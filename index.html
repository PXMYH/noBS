            <p>Amazon.com plans to eliminate roughly 14,000 corporate jobs just months after
Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy warned that AI will shrink the company’s
workforce. The downsizing marks Amazon’s second round of reductions in recent
years. Besides his ongoing war on bureaucracy, Jassy signaled in June that the
company’s staff count would likely fall as it increases its use of artificial
intelligence to complete tasks normally handled by people. The layoffs are
hitting a wide swath of the company, from logistics and payments to video
games and the cloud-computing unit, according to people familiar with the
matter. Bloomberg News Technology and E-Commerce Reporter Spencer Soper joins

The US has demanded that the European Union roll back its climate and human
rights rules in order to allow greater imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG),
as the Trump administration approved a controversial gas export hub along the
Gulf of Mexico coast.

A letter jointly sent by the US and Qatar, two of the three largest LNG
exporters in the world, warned the EU that its new rules pose an “existential
threat” to European economies as they would hinder imports of gas from
countries such as theirs.

Anthony Albanese has struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Donald Trump to
develop critical minerals projects in Australia that will never be
commercially viable.

When it’s laid out like that, it very much sounds as though our prime minister
fell victim to the president’s “art of the deal”. But we are in a new world
where the national value of our critical minerals extends beyond economics,
experts say.

Australia and the US have signed a critical minerals deal designed to break
China’s near complete hold over materials essential to commercial, clean
energy and advanced military hardware.

Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump have committed to each provide at least
US$1bn ($1.54bn) towards a $US8.5bn ($13bn) pipeline of projects in both
countries over the next six months to feed their commercial and defence
industries.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
