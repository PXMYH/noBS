            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Starbucks Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol has spent a lot of his
first year making cosmetic changes -- including bringing back ceramic mugs --
in a bid to revive the world’s largest coffee chain. But now Niccol is onto
the meatier part of right-sizing the company. On Thursday, Starbucks said it
will close 1% of its stores in the US and Canada while cutting 900 jobs.
Investors largely shrugged at the announcement. Wall Street might have wanted
deeper cuts for a company with 360,000 employees as of last year and 41,000
locations globally. The turnaround “still has a long way to go,” Melius
Research analyst Jacob Aiken-Phillips said. The changes being made still don’t
“address that their prices have just gotten way too high” for the current
competitive and economic environment. Bloomberg&#39;s Michael Halen reports.

            <p>Under the known terms of the deal with China, TikTok would get a new board,
including Murdochs and Ellisons

Donald Trump revealed last week the US and China are close to inking a deal to
let TikTok continue operating in the US. Details are not final, but should the

powerful cable TV channels may soon also steer the nation’s most influential
social network. The arrangement would gift Trump’s billionaire allies a degree
of control over US media that would be vast and unprecedented.

Here’s what we know. Under the known terms of the deal, which Trump declared

its security.

Donald Trump’s decision to impose a $100,000 (£74,096) fee on H1-B visas for

was the Kingston Lounge, a storied jazz club and bar. Its transformation
serves as a tangible reminder of cultural erasure and gentrification.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The president’s claim that undermining his tariffs would ‘literally destroy’
the country gets the situation backwards

Just hours after an appeals court ruled that it was illegal for Donald Trump
to impose his unpopular across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries, he
posted a frantic, over-the-top rant that declared: “If allowed to stand, this
Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”

So here the president of the United States was asserting that if the courts
torpedoed his tariffs, then the US, the most powerful nation on earth, would
be destroyed, would “literally” be kaput. Trump seemed to suggest that court
rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of,
say, 100 hydrogen bombs.

UK government borrowing rose to a five-year high in August, official figures

autumn budget.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net
borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – rose to £18bn
in August, £3.5bn more than in the same month a year earlier.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
