of over 7,600 satellites. While the long-term market potential is estimated to
exceed $100 billion by 2035, the economics are challenging for other players
in the space. High launch and replacement costs, limited consumer demand in
remote areas, and rising geopolitical competition put first-place out of reach
for other players, even if they play important roles in global access.

widening a growing wedge between the president and some of his most vociferous
supporters. The White House quickly concluded a full-force response was

jail for allegedly plotting a military coup to stop Lula from taking office
after the former lost the 2022 presidential election.

A growing wave of uncertainty is freezing investment plans in Mexico, the US’s

Investors are weighing Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on 1 August.

undermine legal certainty and could roll back democratic gains.

            <p>Jobs, homes, kids, retirement – some say instability worsened under Trump is
forcing them to postpone it all

Americans are getting married, having kids, buying a home, and retiring years
later than what once was the norm. Many don’t ever reach these milestones.

While there is a complex web of factors that go into decisions like having
kids or buying a house, a person’s financial situation often plays an major
role. In a May Harris/Guardian poll, six out of 10 Americans said that the
economy had affected at least one of their major life goals, because of either
a lack of affordability or anxiety about where the economy is heading.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
