            <p>Live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets as ECB
reduces main interest rate from 2.5% to 2.25%, the seventh cut in a year

  * Trump attacks Fed chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates
  * ECB cuts rates for third time this year as Europe braces for Trump tariffs

 **Donald Trump is awake. And he has strongly criticised monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve, saying the end of Jerome Powell’s tenure as chair “cannot
come fast enough”.**

In a post on Truth Social, the social network he owns, Trump said that Powell
had been too slow to cut interest rates – contrasting its hesistance because
of perceived inflationary pressures with the European Central Bank (ECB).

The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, “Too
Late” Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday
issued a report which was another, and typical, complete “mess!” Oil prices
are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON
TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago,
but he should certainly lower them now. Powell’s termination cannot come fast
enough!

Huang said “China was a very important market for Nvidia” and expressed hope
that his company could “continue co-operating” with the country, according to
state broadcaster CCTV.

The General Motors Flint Assembly plant is a hulking symbol of American auto
industry might, a 5m-sq-ft factory stretching as far as the eye can see down
Van Slyke Road, and it hums: three shifts almost daily crank out the Silverado
truck, the automaker’s most popular product.

The plant weathered decades of industrial disinvestment in Flint, a blue-
collar city of about 80,000 in mid-Michigan, the nation’s auto capital. Flint

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
