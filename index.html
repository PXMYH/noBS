            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to pay 15% of their
revenues from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government in a deal to secure
export licenses, an unusual arrangement that may unnerve both US companies and
Beijing. The arrangement reflects US President Donald Trump&#39;s consistent
effort to engineer a financial payout for America in return for concessions on
trade. His administration has shown a willingness to relax trade conditions
like tariffs in return for giant investment in the US, as with Apple&#39;s pledge
to spend $600 billion on domestic manufacturing. But such a narrow, select
export tax has little precedent in modern corporate history. Our trade tsar

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The controversial $8bn deal was finalized this week and while details are
scarce, the future is set to look very different for one of the biggest
Hollywood studios

The merger between Paramount and Skydance has finally been completed, with
various roadblocks (including Stephen Colbert, apparently, as well as the

It’s an appropriately franchise-y moniker for a merger between a major
Hollywood studio and a company that made its bones as a constant financer of

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Trump may soon name pick for open Fed board seat and Fed chair nominee, but
Bessent wants to stay in current role

Donald Trump said he would “shortly” announce his pick for an open seat on the
Federal Reserve’s board of governors and possibly his nominee for Fed chair as
well, but that he had removed the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, from
consideration since Bessent wants to remain in his current job.

In a CNBC interview, Trump called it a “pleasant surprise” that the Fed
governor Adriana Kugler had decided to leave her seat now instead of when her
term ends in January, a move that appears to have accelerated Trump’s decision
on who to appoint to an open seat on the Fed board with possible plans to
promote that person to the top policymaking role when the term of the Fed
chair, Jerome Powell, ends in May.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The president has an awful lot to say about tariffs – but what about what he
_doesn’t_ say?

Donald Trump’s words and actions rarely align perfectly. If you watch
carefully, what he doesn’t say can be just as telling as what he does.

“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,
to bring down the prices of all goods,” he told the nation ahead of his re-
election. The US president declared that 2 April would “forever be remembered
as the day American industry was reborn”, only to pause tariffs a week later.

China is urging its electric vehicle industry to stop cutting prices and rein
in production amid fears that persistent deflation is imperilling economic
growth.

In recent months Chinese officials have talked repeatedly of the need to
combat “involution” in sectors suffering from overcapacity, such as EVs,
referring to the phenomenon of investing more effort and money for diminishing
returns.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
