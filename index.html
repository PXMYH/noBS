The European Commission has accused Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta of breaching the

Twice as many Britons support tax increases to pay for public services as

of households with finances in distress has increased by 2.9 million since the

inflation but political turmoil poses risk

Rising government debt levels could disturb global financial markets, the head

stakes parliamentary elections.

Agustín Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS), said the world economy was on course for a “smooth landing”
from the inflation crisis, but he warned that policymakers, especially
politicians, needed to be careful.

traditional data – GDP, jobs, etc – and have instead recently been tinkering
with more unusual economic indicators to help them guide their companies. Here
are a few that I’ve seen.

            <p>The Google futurist talks nanobots and avatars, deepfakes and elections – and
why he is so optimistic about a future where we merge with computers

The American computer scientist and techno-optimist Ray Kurzweil is a long-
serving authority on artificial intelligence (AI). His bestselling 2005 book,
_The Singularity Is Near_ , sparked imaginations with sci-fi like predictions
that computers would reach human-level intelligence by 2029 and that we would
merge with computers and become superhuman around 2045, which he called “the
Singularity”. Now, nearly 20 years on, Kurzweil, 76, has a sequel, _The
Singularity Is Nearer_ – and some of his predictions no longer seem so wacky.
Kurzweil’s day job is principal researcher and AI visionary at Google. He
spoke to the _Observer_ in his personal capacity as an author, inventor and
futurist.

 **Why write this book?  
** _The Singularity Is Near_ talked about the future, but 20 years ago, when
people didn’t know what AI was. It was clear to me what would happen, but it
wasn’t clear to everybody. Now AI is dominating the conversation. It is time
to take a look again both at the progress we’ve made – large language models
(LLMs) are quite delightful to use – and the coming breakthroughs.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
