Ghosts and goblins might not be the only scary things popping up this
Halloween. Prices for the holiday’s most popular candy treats are rising,
spooked by Donald Trump’s tariffs and climate change.

Candy prices are estimated to increase by 10.8% this year, according to new
analysis from progressive groups the Century Foundation and the Groundwork
Collaborative, with some popular chocolate-based treats seeing price upticks
of at least 20%. The price increases could mean popular candy like Tootsie
Rolls and Hershey’s chocolate and variety packs are a few dollars more
expensive than just a year ago.

            <p>Food stamps are in danger and hundreds of thousands of federal workers may go
unpaid, as thousands more are laid off

For many Americans, government shutdowns are a painful experience, but in the
current shutdown, Donald Trump – that supposed champion of workers – has gone
out of his way to make things more painful for millions of workers and their
families.

As part of his effort to clobber the Democrats in the shutdown showdown, the
US president has repeatedly treated workers like pawns by employing a callous
calculus that the worse he makes things for workers, the greater the pressure
on congressional Democrats to cry uncle and end the shutdown on his terms. Not
only are several of Trump’s shutdown moves blatantly anti-worker, but legal
experts say many of them violate federal law.

around work and home fail to accommodate working women

When Corinne Low gave birth to her son in 2017, everything seemed to be lining
up. A tenure-track economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton
School, she was working in a career she had long dreamed of. Her husband,
stepchild and baby lived in New York City and the two-hour commute to
Philadelphia was inconvenient but sustainable. She was embarking on a journey
to do it all: a working mom, supporting her family with a career she loved.

As track repairs tripled her commute time, things suddenly felt like they were
falling apart. Instead of getting home in time to put her baby son to bed, Low
found herself sobbing while breast pumping in an Amtrak bathroom.

            <p>Lauren Choi wanted to give plastic a second life. Her experiment turned into
The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
