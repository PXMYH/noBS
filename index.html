            <p>A Citibank employee was recently fired for fudging receipts, but companies are
striving to follow the rules laid down by the IRS

I’m in a moral quandary about a story circulating this week about a Citibank

A year ago this week, when he completed the purchase of Twitter for $44bn,
Elon Musk tweeted “the bird is freed”. Billionaires like nothing more than

pattern of his ever-expanding empire.

Musk has colonised areas of the economy from which public funding and

  * Israel and Hamas at war – live updates

Global oil market prices have climbed for two consecutive weeks since Hamas
launched its shock attack on Israeli civilians on 7 October.

The deadly offensive sent tremors through the oil markets, causing prices to

Cost of living crisis, what cost of living crisis? A new breed of uber-luxury
hotels in London is breaking records with rooms costing more than £1,000 a

In the Peninsula on Hyde Park Corner, a short walk from Buckingham Palace,
rooms start at a kingly £1,300. Despite the startling price tag, the hotel is
said to be running at full capacity, with the manager, Joseph Lee, reporting
it has been “very busy” since last month’s opening. “It’s been very

In most recent fiscal year, the US Department of Labor wage and hour division
reported 835 cases of child labor violations affecting 3,876 minors, and 688
minors employed in violation of hazardous occupation, a 283% increase since
2015. Civil penalties against employers totaled just under $4.3m.

More than six months after Sydney businessman Alexander Csergo was arrested on
allegations he was providing sensitive material to Chinese agents, Australia’s
attorney general has still not consented to his prosecution.

Lawyers for Csergo say he is being used as a “guinea pig” on a never-before-
proven charge, and will seek to have him released on bail after prosecutors
secured more time to confirm the charge against him.

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
