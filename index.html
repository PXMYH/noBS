last year, returning to the rate before the cost of living crisis.

Supermarket prices were 1.8% higher than a year ago in the four weeks to 4

of Ron DeSantis’s campaign

As a high-profile conversation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk was about to
begin, users of X, formerly Twitter, were confronted with the message: “This
Space is not available.”

Spaces, X’s livestreaming audio feature, was the chosen forum for the
dialogue, but it wasn’t working. Clicking on the link to the broadcast, hosted
by Trump’s dormant @RealDonaldTrump account, froze the site and rendered it
unusable. Tweeters said they couldn’t dial in; some said their browsers had
crashed.

spending that money?

Children cost a lot of money. In the US, the average cost of raising a child
from birth to age 18 is $237,482, according to one 2023 study. And that’s just
the price of the “bare bones” expenses – necessities like rent, food and
childcare. In the UK, raising a child costs on average £223,256.

But those numbers can feel abstract. So, to get a better understanding of what
parenting costs really look like, we asked four sets of parents to break down
how much they spend on their child or children per month.

            <p>Tens of thousands descend for the D23 conference – will familiar faces and
bigger parks maintain their loyalty?

It was Friday night, and the southern California stadium was packed with
cheering fans. They wore light-up bracelets and homemade costumes, and
screamed every time a new A-list celebrity made a surprise appearance.

This wasn’t a pop concert or a sports game. It was a marketing event for Walt
Disney, a company with a legion of fans so devoted that about 15,000 were
willing to buy a ticket and come to Anaheim, California, to see its newest
film and TV advertisements first.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>US economy has staying power but China’s growth prospects have worsened and
too little attention is paid to war in Gaza

Back in the 1930s, the French government constructed what it thought was an
impregnable defence system to prevent a repeat of the German invasion at the
start of the first world war. The Maginot Line might have looked impressive
but proved to be a white elephant because when the attack came in 1940 it was
in a different place altogether.

In the past week the financial markets have displayed something of a Maginot
Line mentality. They are right to think there is a threat lurking out there
but they are wrong to think the biggest danger is a recession in the US. The
real threat comes from elsewhere.

            <p>There are signs the billionaire is becoming unpopular with the very
demographic group most likely to buy EVs

Elon Musk has long flirted with rightwing politics, and delights in pushing an
image of himself as a contrarian showman. Yet in recent months the
billionaire’s political allegiances have started to raise a question for
Tesla, the company that he built into the world’s largest electric carmaker:
just how far can he go before customers start to abandon his products?

The German pharmacy chain Rossmann was one of the first to put its head above
the parapet this week. The family-owned company announced that it would not

Donald Trump for US president.

Black Americans strongly support initiatives that would increase the minimum

tax system, according to Black to the Future Action Fund, a political advocacy
thinktank. On Thursday, the group released a 55-page economic agenda based on
its 2023 survey of 211,219 Black people across all 50 states. The organization
hopes that the report will serve as a roadmap for elected officials to address
policy holes, and for advocates to generate campaigns that hold politicians
accountable.

“We have to start imagining what it is that we want and not be so afraid to
break out of what is,” said Alicia Garza, founder and former principal of
Black to the Future Action Fund, at a Thursday symposium in Atlanta.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In the 1980s, a company called Superfest pioneered extra strong glass – but it
disappeared with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now it’s making a comeback

The glass is narrow at the bottom but bulges out a third of the way to the
top. As with the classic British “nonik” pint, the bulge makes the glass
easier to stack and gives your thumb and index finger somewhere to rest. The
name is spelled in fading letters near the rim and means “super tight” or
“super strong” in German, which one might assume to be a reference to the
drinker’s solid grip. In fact, it hails the glass’s extraordinary durability.

This is Superfest, East Germany’s “unbreakable” drinking glass. Invented in
the industry-rich but resource-poor socialist German Democratic Republic,
Superfest glasses were designed with the aim of making them last five times
longer than ordinary drinking glasses. They were soon found to be 10 times
more durable.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
