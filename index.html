            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Tesla’s board is dangling a gargantuan payout in front of its chief. Is it a
manipulative ploy or a desperate stunt?

Bribery is generally unethical and often illegal, but also quite effective.
When my four-year-old is acting up and ignoring my increasingly desperate
pleas for her to get dressed, leave the playground or do something else very
important, I have, on occasion, resorted to desperate promises of ice-cream.
Obviously, I know it’s counterproductive to respond to suboptimal behaviour
with sugar-based bribes. But sometimes you are exhausted and just need a
short-term win. The ice-cream always delivers.

It seems trying to motivate a four-year-old is not much different from trying
to keep a petulant 54-year-old tech mogul in line. On Friday, Tesla’s board of
directors rolled out a pay package proposal for CEO Elon Musk that could, if
he plays his cars right, turn the billionaire into the world’s first
trillionaire. In a section of Tesla’s latest stock market update that began:
“Yes, you read that correctly”, the board outlines everything Musk has to do
to get his hands on that performance-based trillion. Which, to be fair, is a
lot. Tesla needs to reach a market cap of $8.5tn, eight times its current
value, in 10 years to get Musk the payout. Many analysts believe Tesla is
already overvalued, so this is no small task.

Weleda, founded 104 years ago and known worldwide for its holistic remedies,
**** sourced large quantities of medicinal herbs during the Nazi era from an
agricultural plantation overseen by the SS in Dachau, southern Germany,
according to a major report by Anne Sudrow commissioned by the Dachau

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
