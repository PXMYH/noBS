Donald Trump’s new tax bill will add $3.4tn to the national debt over the next
decade, according to new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) released Monday.

Major cuts to Medicaid and the national food stamps program are estimated to

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Report finds that wealth divide widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate
of the whole US over the past decade

Economic inequality has reached a staggering milestone in Silicon Valley: just
nine households hold 15% of the region’s wealth, according to new research
from San Jose State University. A mere 0.1% of residents hold 71% of the tech
hub’s wealth.

The findings come from the 2025 “Silicon Valley Pain Index”, a report
published by SJSU’s Human Rights Institute each year since 2020. The report
aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures
“pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”.

Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that, as a result of the “tougher

Chinese retail platforms.

With 12m low-value parcels each day coming into the EU from online retailers
outside the bloc, Michael McGrath has vowed to crack down on the sale of goods

Memo from the White House: inflation is “right on track”, it declared this
week, citing the latest official data. Price growth is now “very low”,
according to Donald Trump. The actual statistics paint a markedly different
picture.

Just six months after he regained power, in part by promising to rapidly
reduce prices, Trump has presided over the chaotic rollout of tariffs on an
array of overseas products that many have argued risk having the exact
opposite effect.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
