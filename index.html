 **•Business live – latest updates**

US regulators have accused a man of making $1.8m (£1.4m) by trading on
confidential information he overheard while his wife was on a remote call, in
a case that could fuel arguments against working from home.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it charged Tyler Loudon with
insider trading after he “took advantage of his remote working conditions” and
profited from private information related to the oil firm BP’s plans to buy an
Ohio-based travel centre and truck-stop business last year.

This month’s Super Bowl, in the neon glare of the Las Vegas Strip, capped
online betting’s extraordinary rise from pariah to the luxury box of top-
flight sports. Tens of millions of Americans had money riding on the Kansas
City Chiefs’ clash with the San Francisco 49ers.

In its fight to overturn a federal ban on sports betting, legalization’s
supporters argued it would “critically weaken” illegal gambling platforms
across the United States. And yet almost two in three wagers placed on Super
Bowl LVIII were illegal, according to one estimate shared with the Guardian.

lot of jobs” in the film industry will be lost to artificial intelligence.

The US film and TV mogul said he was in the process of adding 12 sound stages

to be genuine. Some of the targets discussed include Nato and the UK Foreign

Apple has warned an Australian proposal to force tech companies to scan cloud
and messaging services for child-abuse material risks “undermining fundamental
privacy and security protections” and could lead to mass surveillance with
global repercussions.

Under two mandatory standards aimed at child safety released by the regulator
last year, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, proposed that
providers should detect and remove child-abuse material and pro-terror
material “where technically feasible” – as well as disrupt and deter new
material of that nature.

The people of a small German town where Elon Musk has built a Tesla factory

to improve access to the site and allow easier transport of the finished
vehicles, including a freight depot and warehouses.

fears of possible flood of imports

Whitehall officials have recommended extending post-Brexit steel quotas – a
development that will come as a relief to the British steel industry, which
had feared a rise in imports.

The “steel safeguards”, which were due to expire at the end of June, were
first brought in by the EU in 2018, which feared that countries such as China
would dump excess steel on the market after sales to the US were blocked by
Donald Trump.

            <p>Aarhus court hears he may have profited from artificially generated playbacks,
in case thought to be first of its kind

A Danish man has gone on trial in the city of Aarhus over accusations that he
fraudulently made 4.38m kroner (more than £502,000) in royalties on music
streaming sites, in what is thought to be the first such trial of its kind.

Prosecutors allege that the 53-year-old profited from streams of 689 pieces of
music across services including Spotify, Apple Music and YouSee Musik. They
say the huge numbers of streams required to generate that amount of money
could not have been generated by genuine users and that unauthorised
techniques were likely to have been deployed instead. The alleged fraud is
understood to have happened between 2013 and 2019.

            <p>America’s robust economic indicators under the president have not been

Joe Biden has spent most of his presidency insisting to Americans that the
economy is on the right track. Poll after poll has shown that most voters do
not believe him. That may be changing.

After months of resilient hiring, better-than-expected economic growth and a
declining rate of inflation, new data shows that Americans are becoming upbeat
about the US economy, potentially reversing the deep pessimism Biden has
struggled to counter for much of the past three years.

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing

amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
