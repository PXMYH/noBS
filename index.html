When Jonlyn Scrogham decided to open a romance novel bookstore last year in

often worked over 60 hours a week without overtime pay.

He recalls having to tell workers who were injured on the job that they had to
deal with the injury and pay for medical care themselves. He knew the
treatment and conditions imposed on himself and his co-workers were wrong, but
he didn’t know he could do anything about it.

Russia to route military technology via third countries to its weapons
factories.

Three companies in mainland China, as well as four in Hong Kong and one in
India, are on a 91-page document of companies and individuals who EU member
states want to add to a growing sanctions list before the second anniversary
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            <p>A sustainable technique for catching tuna that goes back thousands of years is
on the verge of extinction in Italy – but not for a lack of fish

On an overcast morning, several miles off Sardinia’s east coast, four men jump
into a net where 49 giant Atlantic bluefin tuna are fighting for their lives.
For 30 minutes, the men struggle in a frenzy of nets, tails, fins and sleek
silvery bodies before finally securing a metal hook through the gills of the
nearest fish.

From one of seven wooden boats framing this _càmira dâ morti_ (“chamber of
death”), Luigi Biggio yells for his men to pull.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
