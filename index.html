More than 75,000 healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente have started a three-
day strike on Wednesday in the largest demonstration of its kind by healthcare
workers in US history.

The workers, represented by the Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, are
currently bargaining for new union contracts after their current contracts
expired on 1 October. Workers are demanding significant wage increases and
substantive improvements to what they say has been severe understaffing in
healthcare facilities that worsened throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.

To own a car in Singapore, a buyer must bid for a certificate that now costs
more than $106,000 (S$145,000), equivalent to four Toyota Camry Hybrids in the
US, as a post-pandemic recovery has driven up the cost of the country’s
vehicle quota system to all-time highs.

Singapore has a 10-year “certificate of entitlement” (COE) system, introduced
in 1990, to control the number of vehicles in the small city-state, which is
home to 5.9 million people and can be driven across in less than an hour.

Before his retirement in 2009, Peter Bergrud was, for decades, a construction
worker, laying cement, water and sewage pipes in trenches around Seattle.
Bergrud often did the handling, cutting and laying of the cement pipe himself
because he was so skilled.

In early 2018, he started having problems breathing, and became quickly out of
breath. In February that year, he was diagnosed with two forms of
mesothelioma, and told these types of cancer were only caused by asbestos
exposure. Doctors told him and his family he would not survive surgery or
chemotherapy.

            <p>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 04:00:32 CDT</p>
            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>As author of The Big Short and Moneyball, Michael Lewis is perhaps the most
celebrated journalist of his generation. Now he delivers an astonishing
portrait of the fallen crypto billionaire. But did he get too close?

Right around the time the gales of the financial crisis were tearing up Wall
Street in 2009, Meredith Whitney started her own financial research firm.
Whitney, a stock market analyst, had predicted the crash of the previous year,
and among the journalists who had sought her out had been Michael Lewis. When
her new Manhattan office opened and she threw “a party for all the muckety-
mucks”, she invited Lewis. He had just published a magazine article calling
Wall Street’s titans greedy and stupid, so thrusting him into a gathering of
those selfsame titans was like taking a Broadway heckler into the play’s
dressing rooms. “But all these former heads of investment banks, all these
current bankers – they ran, not walked, to the office, just to meet him,”
Whitney said. “One hedge fund manager walked in with 15 copies of Lewis’s
books. Michael signed them all.”

Lewis enjoys a rare kind of celebrity among the moneyed men and women of the
US. They believe he _gets_ __ them, that he is the Hemingway of their
bullring. He used to be one of them, after all: a Salomon Brothers bond
salesman in the late 1980s, and therefore part of the extravagant avarice that
defined Wall Street in that decade. Then he quit to write a memoir about it,
Liar’s Poker. It was the first in a series of blockbusters about the thin top
slice of American society: the one in which Whitney and her muckety-mucks
reside, alongside other mavens, savants and powerbrokers. They drive its
commerce and politics, its sports and culture – and Lewis is their bard. He’s
the kind of writer Vanity Fair will call upon to interview Barack Obama one
day, Arnold Schwarzenegger the next. When a rumour surfaced that Vanity Fair
used to pay Lewis $10 a word – while most journalists otherwise languish in
the 50-cent range – it almost didn’t matter if it was true. (It was, it turned
out.) The rumour merely confirmed what everyone knew: Lewis is the most
prestigious narrator of American life.

The future of Donald Trump’s New York real estate business will be decided in
a Manhattan court case that began on Monday.

The New York attorney general, Letitia James, is taking Trump to court after a
three-year investigation found that he and others within the Trump
Organization repeatedly used false or misleading financial statements to
broker deals, obtain favorable loans and bolster the appearance of his net
worth.

            <p>Association of Flight Attendants accuses airline of fostering anti-union
culture, including ‘illegal company unions’

Flight attendants at the largest regional airline in the US, SkyWest, are
seeking to unionize the airline, taking on what they claim is an illegal
company union and pushing back on alleged retaliatory firings of two flight
attendants who were leaders of an organizing campaign.

Flight attendants at SkyWest, which operates flights for Delta, United,
American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, are currently represented by the
SkyWest Inflight Association (SIA), a work group that does not purport to be a
union and is supported and funded by the airline itself, according to a
handbook for SIA representatives.

compensation continued to climb to record highs.

A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies singles out which 100

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in
2022, while their CEOs took home an average $15.3m.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
