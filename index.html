            <p>As poor harvests send prices soaring, one raid mounted on a quiet rural grower
netted an illicit haul worth €300,000

The Polygyros olive oil cooperative does not seem a likely target for a heist.
If anything, its setting, at the foot of the Holomontas mountain in Halkidiki,
evokes the bucolic innocence of rural Greece.

Certainly its breezeblock warehouses bear little resemblance to the modern
premises that house the Mitseas olive mills in southern Messinia. But in
recent weeks both have been targeted by thieves, who gained entry through a
battered iron door in Polygyros and a hi-tech security portal in Messinia.
“The oil has gone,” said Yannis Keliafanos, a farmer at the cooperative.
“There is very little of it left.”

            <p>Deutsche Bahn’s once-admired service has descended into chaos. Whether decades
of poor investment or the company’s unusual structure is to blame, it’s a huge
headache for a coalition trying to meet climate goals

The sleek high-speed train is 10 minutes behind schedule when it slides into
Cologne’s main station before continuing its journey north to Dortmund. The
delay is now such a common occurrence that the train manager does not even
bother to mention it to disembarking passengers.

In late afternoon on an unremarkable weekday in this western German city,
holidaymakers are hauling suitcases through the station, workers are commuting
home, and the late arrival of Deutsche Bahn’s IC 118 from Innsbruck is no
surprise.

the modern US, it would be difficult to conceive such a thing sprouting from
the environs of Phoenix, Arizona – a sprawling, concrete incursion into a
brutal desert environment that is sometimes derided as the least sustainable
city in the country.

But it is here that such a neighborhood, called Culdesac, has taken root. On a
17-acre site that once contained a car body shop and some largely derelict
buildings, an unusual experiment has emerged that invites Americans to live in
a way that is rare outside of fleeting experiences of college, Disneyland or
trips to Europe: a walkable, human-scale community devoid of cars.

The Caribbean state of Dominica has sold citizenship to thousands of
individuals including a former Afghan spymaster, a Turkish millionaire
convicted of fraud and a former Libyan colonel under Muammar Gaddafi, the
first detailed examination of the country’s controversial “golden passports”
scheme has found.

The findings are from Dominica: Passports of the Caribbean, an investigation

compensation continued to climb to record highs.

A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies singles out which 100

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in
2022, while their CEOs took home an average $15.3m.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
