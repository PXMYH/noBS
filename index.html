Chief executives of some of America’s largest companies will meet privately
with Donald Trump later on Thursday, and many CEOs who were once critical of
his unprecedented conduct appear increasingly open to the former president’s
return to office, a Guardian analysis has found.

The private audience with the former president will take place at the
quarterly gathering of the Business Roundtable, a powerful Washington lobbying
group that advocates for the interests of chief executives of big US firms.
Joe Biden was also invited; his chief of staff will attend while the US
president is abroad, a Business Roundtable spokesperson said.

Elon Musk has claimed Tesla shareholders are voting by a wide margin to
approve a compensation package for him worth about $45bn (£35bn) in the run-up

The pay package, which is the highest ever awarded to the chief executive of a
US company, is subject to an investor ballot after it was thrown out by a US
judge earlier this year. Shareholders will also vote on Musk’s proposal to
move the legal base of the electric carmaker to Texas.

Antonio Soprano, 62, who was stopped while bringing plants into the country

When he delivered his State of the Union address in March, Joe Biden framed

Australians appear financially resilient, according to many of the major
indicators, with indebted households finding creative ways to manage budgets.
But just under the surface there are signs of financial stress everywhere,
raising questions over how long people can hang on in an environment of
elevated interest rates and high living costs.

Here are four charts that show the strains many people are under.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
