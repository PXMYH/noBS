2% to 4.5%

As Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his
policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector
that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory
costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%.

“There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris
Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth
who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with
slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages,
if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable.

Global growth will be stronger than previously expected this year after Donald
Trump scaled back his most extreme tariff threats, the International Monetary
Fund said as it upgraded the economic outlook for 2025.

The Washington-based organisation said a “de-escalation in tariffs” by the
White House had spurred a recovery in global trade and a broader economic
expansion, though US policies remain “highly uncertain” and risks to growth
“firmly on the downside”.

  * Business live – latest updates

Uber’s rival taxi operators will not have to pay 20% VAT on their profits
outside London after a UK supreme court verdict in a long-running case.

The court ruled that private-hire operators do not enter into a contract with
passengers, dismissing an Uber appeal. Private-hire firms declared the verdict
to be a “triumph for the sector” after a three-year legal battle, which they
had said could end with fares rising sharply for passengers.

and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
