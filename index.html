There is a short stretch of prime waterfront real estate in Miami that has
come to be known as Billionaire’s Beach. It contains a mix of famous old art
deco hotels such as the Delano and Raleigh, both undergoing extensive upmarket
refurbishments, and the construction of exclusive new residential tower blocks
with high-end apartments running into the tens of millions.

It is here on the sun-filled shores of South Beach, more than a thousand miles
from the chills of a Manhattan winter, where realtors and developers are
beginning to see the first shoots of what they call the “Mamdani effect”: the
predicted exodus of wealthy New Yorkers in the wake of democratic socialist
Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor.

On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield
walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a
scanner gun and a laptop.

Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut
growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their
shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as
item after item rang up at a higher price.

Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch authorized a plan for Fox News to embrace Donald

viewers angry with the network, a lawyer for the voting technology company
Smartmatic argued on Tuesday.

“The conservative viewers, their bread and butter, abandoned them,” J Erik
Connolly told the New York state supreme court judge David B Cohen. “So what
do they do? They return back to what they know best: they return back to
disinformation, pro-Trump propaganda and xenophobia. The election story and
the election fraud claims was the perfect vehicle for them to get back on to
their core messaging.”

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
