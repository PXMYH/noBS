            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>President Donald Trump imposed the steepest American tariffs in a century as
he steps up his campaign to reshape the global economy, sparking threats of
retaliation and a selloff in markets around the world. Trump announced
Wednesday he will apply at least a 10% tariff on all exporters to the US, with
even higher duties on some 60 nations, to counter large trade imbalances with
the US. That includes some of the country’s biggest trading partners, such as
China -- which now faces a tariff of well above 50% on many goods -- as well
as the European Union, Japan and Vietnam. “For years, hard-working American
citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and
powerful, much of it at our expense,” Trump said during an event in the White
House Rose Garden to unveil the so-called reciprocal tariffs. “Now it’s our
turn to prosper.” The Founder of Port City Brewing says it&#39;s thrown the supply
chain into chaos. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>Shares slump on both sides of the Atlantic, and across Asia-Pacific, as US
dollar falls to six month low after US President Trump’s ‘liberation day’

  * Full report: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs
  * Analysis: Trump’s tariffs likely to raise prices and cause chaos
  * What are tariffs and why do they matter?

The new US tariffs “will only create losers” with US consumers particularly
hard hit, the **German Automotive Industry Association (VDA)** , has said in a
statement, calling on the EU “to act together and with the necessary force,
while continuing to signal its willingness to negotiate.”

The body, which represents the powerful German auto industry, said the tariffs
marked

the United States’ departure from the rules-based global trade order – and
thus a departure from the foundation for global value creation and
corresponding growth and prosperity in many regions of the world.

This is not America first; this is America alone.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The US stock market plummeted after President Trump announced a raft of tariff
hikes, wiping out $3 trillion in combined stock-market value and sending the
S&amp;P 500 Index down 4.5% and the Nasdaq 100 down 5%. The tariffs threaten to
upend supply chains, rekindle inflation, and slow global economic growth, with
some economists predicting a recession if a retaliatory spiral is triggered.
The market selloff shows a shift in sentiment, with investors now pricing in a
roughly 50% chance of four quarter-point interest rate cuts by the end of this
year to mitigate the economic impact of the tariffs. Peter Tchir, Head of
Macro Strategy at Academy Securities joins Bloomberg Intelligence to break

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Wall Street economists said the US risks a recession this year and inflation
could return to pandemic levels following the Trump administration’s
announcement of major tariffs on global trading partners. Nomura Securities
International Inc. said it expects gross domestic product to expand 0.6% in
2025 after accounting for the new levies on imports, and a key measure of
underlying inflation to rise to 4.7%. Barclays Plc economists took a more
pessimistic view toward GDP -- projecting a 0.1% contraction -- and a slightly
more optimistic view of inflation, penciling in a 3.7% increase. They also
look for the unemployment rate to climb by year-end. Yardeni Research
President Ed Yardeni explains why he believes that investors need to ride out
the market downturn and refrain from selling all of their market assets. Ed

For weeks, Donald Trump and his aides sought to brand Wednesday as “liberation

National home prices hit a new peak in March as February’s rate cut reignited
buyer demand, according to separate reports from Australia’s leading property

As much as I have the general vibe of a luddite (strange hobbies, socially

automation: it’s nice that computers have made some boring things in our lives
less boring.

I side with the writer and philosopher John Gray, who in his terrifying work
of eco-nihilism Straw Dogs balances the fact that human beings are a plague
animal who are wrecking the biosphere that supports them with the idea that we
have made our lives easier through technology. Gray, in particular, calls
anaesthetised dentistry an “unmixed blessing”.

            <p>Elliott Ingram was stunned at how a thief made off with his Ioniq 5 deploying
a device to mimic the smart key – and says he should have been warned

The motor manufacturer Hyundai faces legal action over allegations it failed
to warn its customers that one of its most popular models of electric cars
could be stolen “effortlessly in seconds”. Elliott Ingram, an expert in
digital security, was stunned when a CCTV camera installed at his home
recorded a hooded thief stealing his Hyundai Ioniq 5 car in less than 20
seconds.

The thief is believed to have used a device, available online, to mimic the
car’s electronic key. It is the latest in a spate of thefts involving the
vehicle, and many owners now resort to a steering lock. Ingram’s car was later
recovered by police, but he is terminating the lease and seeking compensation
from the motor company. He says the South Korean car giant should have alerted
customers to the security vulnerabilities.

Chinese vice-premier Ding Xuexiang has pledged to give stronger policy support

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.
