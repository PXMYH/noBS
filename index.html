            <p>Forget Hollywood depictions of gun-toting robots running wild in the streets –
the reality of artificial intelligence is far more dangerous, warns the
historian and author in an exclusive extract from his new book

Throughout history many traditions have believed that some fatal flaw in human
nature tempts us to pursue powers we don’t know how to handle. The Greek myth
of Phaethon told of a boy who discovers that he is the son of Helios, the sun
god. Wishing to prove his divine origin, Phaethon demands the privilege of
driving the chariot of the sun. Helios warns Phaethon that no human can
control the celestial horses that pull the solar chariot. But Phaethon
insists, until the sun god relents. After rising proudly in the sky, Phaethon
indeed loses control of the chariot. The sun veers off course, scorching all
vegetation, killing numerous beings and threatening to burn the Earth itself.
Zeus intervenes and strikes Phaethon with a thunderbolt. The conceited human
drops from the sky like a falling star, himself on fire. The gods reassert
control of the sky and save the world.

Two thousand years later, when the Industrial Revolution was making its first
steps and machines began replacing humans in numerous tasks, Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe published a similar cautionary tale titled The Sorcerer’s
Apprentice. Goethe’s poem (later popularised as a Walt Disney animation
starring Mickey Mouse) tells of an old sorcerer who leaves a young apprentice
in charge of his workshop and gives him some chores to tend to while he is
gone, such as fetching water from the river. The apprentice decides to make
things easier for himself and, using one of the sorcerer’s spells, enchants a
broom to fetch the water for him. But the apprentice doesn’t know how to stop
the broom, which relentlessly fetches more and more water, threatening to
flood the workshop. In panic, the apprentice cuts the enchanted broom in two
with an axe, only to see each half become another broom. Now two enchanted
brooms are inundating the workshop with water. When the old sorcerer returns,
the apprentice pleads for help: “The spirits that I summoned, I now cannot rid
myself of again.” The sorcerer immediately breaks the spell and stops the
flood. The lesson to the apprentice – and to humanity – is clear: never summon
powers you cannot control.

            <p>British tech entrepreneur who sold his Autonomy software group to Hewlett-
Packard and was later cleared after a long-running US fraud case

Mike Lynch, who has died aged 59 in the wreck of his yacht, was sometimes

learned how to turn it into commercial success.

Such was this success that his company, Autonomy, was valued at $11bn when he
sold it to Hewlett-Packard in 2011, but the fall-out from the sale would come
to overshadow his technological achievements, and lead to a national debate
about the circumstances in which UK citizens may be extradited to the US.

couple who own a bed and breakfast in the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge,
Georgia. They also understand that when some guests arrive, it may be the
first time they spend the night with Black hosts.

So when people peruse the website of Stockbridge Lakes Bed &amp; Breakfast, they
see images of a picturesque lake, lush landscaping and elegant bedrooms. They
learn about the gourmet breakfasts, the sleeping porch and the paddle boats
that guests are free to use. But they won’t find any photos of the innkeepers.

            <p>Despite interest rates being at a 20-year high, sales of small businesses are
strong, and may continue for years

When you hear “startup”, you might think of the millions of entrepreneurs who
have founded new businesses over the past few years. But these are mostly
freelancers, contractors and people with full-time jobs who can accommodate a
side gig. The real startup story is quietly happening elsewhere: trillions of
dollars of wealth are slowly being transferred to a younger generation by
boomers selling their businesses to those looking to build their own.

According to a new report from BizBuySell, a business brokerage and research
site, the number of small businesses being sold has not only recovered to pre-
pandemic levels, but is quickly rising. And the market for would-be
entrepreneurs is hot. Business owners who sold their companies in the second
quarter of this year are getting 20% higher prices than those who sold their
businesses the same time last year.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
