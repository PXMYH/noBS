electricity as US power demand rises significantly in part due to the needs of
artificial intelligence and datacenters. Google has reached agreements to
supply its datacenters with nuclear power via a half-dozen small reactors
built by a California utility company. Microsoft’s similar contract will

nuclear accident and radiation leak in US history.

            <p>Is artificial intelligence coming for everyone’s jobs? Not if this lot have
anything to do with it

The novelist Ewan Morrison was alarmed, though amused, to discover he had
written a book called Nine Inches Pleases a Lady. Intrigued by the limits of
generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had asked ChatGPT to give him the
names of the 12 novels he had written. “I’ve only written nine,” he says.
“Always eager to please, it decided to invent three.” The “nine inches” from
the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthy Robert Burns poem. “I
just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,” says Morrison. He is yet
to write Nine Inches – “or its sequel, Eighteen Inches”, he laughs. His actual
latest book, For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human
costs of technology.

Morrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and their
capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one
of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are
terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don’t
want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it’s a bit rubbish,
and more trouble than it’s worth; and those who simply prefer humans to
robots.

  * Business live – latest updates

China has accused the US of “seriously violating” the fragile US-China detente
that has been in place for less than a month since the two countries agreed to
pause the trade war that risked upending the global economy.

China and the US agreed on 12 May to pause for 90 days the skyrocketing
“reciprocal” tariffs that both countries had placed on the others goods in a
frenzied trade war that started a few weeks earlier. Tariffs had reached 125%
on each side, which officials feared amounted to virtual embargo on trade
between the world’s two biggest economies.

Workers’ rights across every continent in the world are in a “freefall”,
according to the 2025 Global Rights Index released by the International Trade
Union Confederation, the largest trade union federation in the world.

The index noted workers’ rights and democracy around the world are often under
attack by “far-right politicians and their unelected billionaire backers.
Whether it’s Donald Trump and Elon Musk in the US or Javier Milei and Eduardo
Eurnekian in Argentina, we see the same playbook of unfairness and

Old people are making news. Just this past week in Denmark, the retirement age
for collecting a government pension was increased to 70 years old, an issue
that has caused much debate in that country. Here in the US, questions have
been raised about Joe Biden’s mental acuity while he was still in office.
Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the age of 94 from Berkshire
Hathaway. Donald Trump’s behavior, at the age of 78, continues to raise
concern, if not alarm.

When are people too old to do their jobs?

When millions of people across the Iberian peninsula were left without power
last month the political fallout ignited debate over Europe’s renewable energy
agenda, and fuelled the rising interest in nuclear power.

Europe’s largest power blackout in decades, still largely unexplained, has
raised questions about whether renewable energy can be relied on to provide a
stable source of clean energy. It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the
global nuclear power renaissance already under way.

Hospitality venues in France such as hotels, restaurants and campsites that do

emerged this week.

Laurence Rossignol, a socialist senator, plans to introduce a private member’s
bill to make it illegal to ban children from such establishments, the Times
reported, while the French high commissioner for childhood, Sarah El Haïry,
said government lawyers were looking into whether it would be possible to take
legal action against places that exclude families.

As the first Pride month under Donald Trump’s second presidency approaches,
LGBTQ+ businesses are stepping up, evolving quickly to meet the community’s
growing concerns.

Since day one, Trump has signed executive orders targeting the LGBTQ+
community, particularly the trans and gender non-conforming population. He
aims to eradicate “gender ideology” by enforcing a two-sex binary determined
at conception, reinstating and expanding the military ban on transgender
service members, and directing agencies to prevent gender-affirming care for
youth.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
