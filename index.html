Bitcoin has recorded its largest monthly loss since June 2022, pushing it into

election win faded, before the president pumped it up again on Sunday.

The price of bitcoin fell by 17.5% in February, the biggest monthly drop since
June 2022, and its 11th worst month in the last decade, as negative sentiment

When Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s “truck of the future” in 2019, Filipos could
barely contain his excitement. He quickly paid $100 to get on the waitlist.
Filipos described himself as a “true Tesla fanboy”, and the Cybertruck would
be the third vehicle he’d buy from the company.

“When the Cybertruck came out, I watched the live event that night, and my
wife was sitting there going, ‘No. No. No,’” said Filipos, who lives in a
suburb of Philadelphia and whose last name is being withheld for fear of
online retribution. Despite his wife’s disapproval, Filipos loved the bulky
trapezoidal truck. “I was truly geeking out on it,” he said.

The Trump administration recently announced that it would be laying off
approximately 6,700 workers at the Internal Revenue Service, about 8% of the
people employed by the agency. Tens of thousands of federal employees at other
agencies are also losing their jobs.

The timing could not be worse. We’re in the middle of the tax season with
corporations and individuals facing filing deadlines in March and April.
Millions of returns will need to be processed. Refunds will be due. Questions
will need to be answered. But that’s not all.

An Elon Musk ally installed in the US government said in a late night email

option would be shuttered – and its employees would be let go.

The 18F office within the General Services Administration (GSA) created the
IRS Direct File program that allows for free online tax filings. It has been a
frequent target of Musk, and one of the billionaire businessman’s close
associates who holds a key position in the GSA informed staffers that the
agency would close 18F in an email to staffers that arrived around 1am on
Saturday morning.

ChatGPT to Dall-E to learn and bond

Jules White used to believe his 11-year-old son needed to know how to code to
be successful. Now, though, the Vanderbilt computer science professor says
it’s more crucial for James to learn a new, more useful skill: how to prompt
artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, White has been showing his son the
ropes of generative AI. He began by demonstrating to James how ChatGPT can
create games using photos of toys on the floor of their house. Later, White
exposed him to AI’s hallucinatory flaws by having his son debunk ChatGPT-
generated world record claims with verified information from the Guinness Book
of World Records. After more than two years of experimentation, White’s son,
now in fifth grade, has learned how to integrate AI into a range of everyday
activities, from crafting study materials to determining the cost of shoes
without a price tag.

            <p>Government employees fight the Trump administration’s chaos by organizing and
publishing information on Bluesky

After seeing Elon Musk’s X post on Saturday afternoon about an email that
would soon land in the inboxes of 2.3 million federal employees asking them to
list five things they did the week before, a clandestine network of employees
and contractors at dozens of federal agencies began talking on an encrypted
app about how to respond.

Employees on a four-day, 10-hours-a-day schedule wouldn’t even see the email
until Tuesday – past the deadline for responding – some noted. There was also
a bit of snark: “bonus points to anyone who responds that they spent their
government subsidy on hookers and blow,” one worker said.

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the
California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert:
watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner,
was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures
included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a
threadbare T-shirt from Occidental College, the school where Bruce and Nancy
first met – and where he would go on to work for more than 35 years.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
