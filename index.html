            <p>Brazilian-born Nemuel DePaula wants his Lenita flower truck business to
blossom in its brick-and-mortar location

Nemuel DePaula has never been afraid of big pivots. The Brazil native
immigrated to Boston at age 10, started his own graphic design business,
Grita, while still in high school, and moved himself and the business across
the country to Los Angeles in 2013. Four years later, DePaula took a gamble
again with Lenita, the part-time mobile flower shop he launched and named
after his mother.

DePaula, 35, has been captivated by flowers since childhood. “The first thing
I ever stole was a rose,” he said with a laugh as he recalled the perfect
bloom he snipped from his neighbor’s garden and slipped to his mom as a small
child. Over the years, his aesthetic sensibilities evolved from purloined
roses to less conventional species. His latest love is the “graffiti
anthurium”, a tropical flower with a natural paint-splattered effect that
resembles a bloodied orchid – but in a cool way.

The gifting is done. Some were successful, others less so – the wrong color,
size, redundant, too impulsive, not suitable for re-gifting. US consumers
return about 20% of all online purchases and the post-holiday period is when
the massive, but often unseen, returns logistics industry _–_ the reverse
supply chain _–_ goes into overdrive.

According to the National Retail Federation, US consumers returned more than
$816bn worth of retail merchandise in 2022, up 7% from a record $761bn a year
earlier, and more than the US defense budget.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
