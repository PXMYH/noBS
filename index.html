The world’s largest banks boosted the amount of financing given to fossil fuel
companies last year, committing $869bn to those involved in coal, oil and gas
despite the worsening climate crisis and the banks’ own, fraying,
environmental commitments, a new report has found.

The report, compiled by a coalition of eight green groups, shows that while
the amount loaned by big banks to fossil fuel firms had been declining in
2021, last year saw an abrupt reversal. Two-thirds of the world’s largest 65
banks increased their fossil fuel financing by $162bn from 2023 to 2024.

Donald Trump has displayed his disdain for the collective western values

demanding that Russia be readmitted to the group. He also said the war in
Ukraine would not have happened if Moscow had been kept in the club.

Trump made his remarks in front of media, alongside Canada’s prime minister,

of talks.

The escalating crisis between Israel and Iran has already triggered the
largest single-day oil price surge in the last three years, and the question
for many is how much higher the oil markets might climb.

The price of Brent crude has jumped by about $10 a barrel since the start of
June to a high of $78 a barrel on Friday, amid growing concerns that the

proportion since the Lowy Institute began polling in 2005.

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
