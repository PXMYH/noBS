            <p>S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones rise sharply after extraordinarily volatile week as
experts warn of continued turbulence

Donald Trump insisted his trade war with much of the world was “doing really
well” despite mounting fears of recession and as Beijing hit back and again
hiked tariffs on US exports to China.

As the US president said his aggressive tariffs strategy was “moving along

            <p>The reason the US president had to back down on tariffs once investors started
dumping treasury bonds

Donald Trump’s tariff war has spooked stock markets and heightened fears of a
recession in the US and Europe. But neither factor appears to have been what
motivated the president’s sudden volte-face this week, when he paused most of
his “liberation day” border taxes for 90 days.

The fact Trump could not ignore was a mass sell-off by investors of US
government bonds. But what exactly are bonds, how are they traded – and why
are they so central to the current crisis?

            <p>Changes at two dozen prestigious firms underscore Trump’s successful

Nearly two dozen US law firms have quietly scrubbed references to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) from their website and revised descriptions of pro-
bono work to more closely align with Donald Trump’s priorities, a Guardian
review has found, underscoring the Trump administration’s successful campaign
of intimidation against the legal profession.

The changes, which have occurred at some of the nation’s most prestigious
firms, include eliminating mention of pro-bono immigration work from firm
websites and deleting sections entirely related to DEI. In some cases, firms
appear to have dropped the word “diversity” from descriptions of their work.
In at least one case, a change included revising a quote from firm partners to
eliminate mention of diversity and inclusion.

she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol

husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
