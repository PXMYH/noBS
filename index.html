Qantas’s rival points offering.

            <p>Governor vetoes bill requiring generative AI safety testing after tech
industry says it would drive companies away

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, on Sunday vetoed a hotly contested
artificial intelligence safety bill after the tech industry raised objections.
Newsom said that requiring companies to stress-test large AI models before
releasing them could drive AI businesses from the state and hinder innovation.

“California is home to 32 of the world’s 50 leading AI companies,” the
governor said in a statement accompanying the veto. “The bill applies
stringent standards to even the most basic functions – so long as a large
system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting
the public from real threats posed by the technology.”

The Monongahela River winds through the tight Mon Valley south of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, creating a main artery in the nation’s industrial heart, where
the steel and coal industries have driven the region’s economy and shaped
political landscapes since the late 19th century.

In the weeks preceding the election, the region is once again playing an
outsize role in determining the nation’s political future. A controversial
Biden-Harris administration plan to kill Pittsburgh-based US Steel’s proposed
sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel is viewed in part as an election-year strategy to
shore up critical union support in a must-win swing state.

is fuelling a growing backlash

  * Events arm of Economist group to stop signing tobacco sponsorship deals

Since its foundation 181 years ago the Economist has built a reputation for
integrity based on the independence of its editorial content. But now the
respected weekly news magazine and website is facing a growing backlash over
the editorial and commercial ties that a division of its parent company has
with three of the world’s biggest tobacco companies.

Economist Impact, a unit that ran 136 events in the year to the end of March,
was earlier this month forced to cancel at the last minute a world cancer
conference due to be held in Brussels, after an outcry from speakers and
attendees about its links with big tobacco.

            <p>Mohamed al-Menfi defends dismissal of previous governor and says deal will
bring back international accountability

A deal backed by leaders on both sides of Libya’s political divide to appoint
a new central bank governor has the potential “to resolve all the political
issues” in the country, Libya’s head of state has said.

Mohamed al-Menfi, the president of Libya’s Presidential Council who is largely
aligned with the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, was accused of acting
unilaterally and propelling the country into fresh turmoil when in August he
dismissed the previous long-serving bank governor, Sadiq al-Kabir, who then
fled into exile.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Jeffrey L Bowman’s Reframe consultancy is using artificial intelligence to
help with engaging employees with diversity programming or making a budget for
DEI work

With its focus on remedying historical and economic inequities, DEI has become
an unassailable component of American life. The ideological framework – more
formally known as diversity, equity and inclusion – is now a standard element
of how businesses are run and students are taught. (It’s also become a
weaponized term, as was the case when a New York Post column said that Kamala
Harris would be a “DEI president”.)

Nearly $350bn flowed into DEI and racial justice initiatives during the two
years following the 2020 murder George Floyd, according to a report by
McKinsey. The DEI industry – mostly consultants whose work focuses on helping
organizations review and revise their spending, recruiting and hiring
practices – is worth close to $10bn. But over the past few years, DEI programs
have been dramatically downsized. Universities such as Harvard and MIT are now
scrapping mandatory DEI statements and companies ranging from Nordstrom to
Salesforce are slashing related budgets and staffing targets.

            <p>Many fear the arrival of tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google in
the state of Querétaro will place too much of a strain on scarce water and
electricity resources

In a nondescript building in an industrial park in central Mexico, cavernous
rooms hold stack after stack of servers studded with blue lights, humming with
computations and cooled by thousands of little fans and large vents blasting
great columns of air across the room.

“Datacentres are the lungs of digital life,” says Amet Novillo, the managing
director of Equinix Mexico, a digital infrastructure company, as he stands in
the middle of the airflows that stop the hardware overheating.

            <p>Union members picketing in Renton, Washington, say they won’t accept low pay
offers nearly two weeks into strike

Workers have manned a picket line outside Boeing’s airplane factory in Renton,
Washington, around the clock since tens of thousands walked off the job
earlier this month. Almost two weeks into the strike, the largest now under
way in the US, nobody knows when it will end.

Orlando, a quality inspector at the aerospace giant, arrived at 3.45am on
Saturday, long before dawn. On the outskirts of a city as expensive as
Seattle, the cost of living is “always going up”, he said. “And I guess the
biggest part is making sure our wages reflect that.”

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
