            <p>European Commission finds iPhone maker broke new laws designed to protect
smaller competitors against big tech platforms

Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow
smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and
alternative apps in the tech business’s app store.  
  
The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology
regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple after an
investigation launched in March.  
  
“For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying
consumers new opportunities and choices,” said Thierry Breton, the European
commissioner responsible for digital markets, on X.

In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European
Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the
Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering
consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”.

It’s Wednesday evening and I’m at my kitchen table, scowling into my laptop as

Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, just made a very honest admission: “It is
true that a company’s not a family,” he said in a recent podcast interview.
“We used to refer to ourselves as a family, and then we did have to fire
people, or they’d have to leave the company, and you don’t fire members of
your family.”

Whenever a CEO says their employees are “family”, they’re lying. Your company
is not your family.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
