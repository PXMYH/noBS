            <p>Influencers’ inventive recipes for high-protein dairy product have boosted
trade by 40% for one producer

If you peered into a UK fridge in the late 1970s, it is more than likely you
would have found a pot of cottage cheese tucked between the prawn cocktail and
sherry trifle.  
  
A popular “diet food” at the time, demand waned in subsequent decades as the
high-protein, low-fat wonder food fell out of fashion. But 50 years on from
its heyday, cottage cheese is making a comeback in the UK, and has become an
unlikely hit with health-conscious Gen Z.  
  
Driven by a wave of social media influencers sharing inventive recipes for the
dairy product, which is made from milk curds, UK retailers are reporting
significant increases in sales, while producers are struggling to keep up with
demand.  
  
“It’s come from absolutely nowhere,” said Robert Graham, managing director of
Graham’s Family Dairy. “Since May of last year, when there was a TikTok craze
that went on, cottage cheese sales for us are up 40%.”  
  
The company said the growth in production, the equivalent of an extra 2m
kilograms a year, means it is looking at ways to increase output, including an
initial growth plan to invest £5m to bolster its production facilities.  
  
“We are considering new factories because cottage cheese production is almost
full,” said Graham, whose company supplies big retailers such as Co-op,
Morrisons and Aldi.

Dairy company Arla is also benefiting from the cottage cheese rush, reporting
a double-digit increase in sales in the last three months, while Marks &amp;
Spencer experienced a 30% increase compared with last year, and Waitrose
reported a 22% year-on-year rise.

Hiring in the US slowed in April with the workforce adding another 175,000
jobs and wage growth slowing.

The news cheered investors hoping that a cooling labor market will prompt the
Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – which have been driven to a 20-year

The Kremlin-owned gas company Gazprom has plunged to its first annual loss in
more than 20 years, after gas sales more than halved following Vladimir
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The company made a net loss of 629bn roubles (£5.5bn) in 2023 amid dwindling
gas trade with Europe, once Gazprom’s main sales market, as a result of
sanctions and the throttling of pipelines to the continent.

executive officer compensation proposals at the company that raise “serious
concerns regarding Dollar General’s governance, corporate priorities, and
treatment of its workforce”.

In a letter to shareholders the SOC Investment Group, formerly known as the
Change to Win Federation, pointed out that the median salary for a Dollar
General employee in 2023 was $18,657 annually, or over $9 an hour, while
Dollar General’s CEO, Todd Vasos, received nearly $183m in compensation from

            <p>Experts say only ‘handful of plants’ operating with the dirtiest fuel will
likely survive, and only Trump and lawsuits could save them

New climate rules imposed by Joe Biden’s administration requiring huge cuts in
carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants will accelerate the decline of
an industry that until recently provided most of America’s power, experts say,
potentially even dealing a death blow to coal in the US.

Coal, once the backbone of the US economy and feted by Donald Trump as he rose
to the presidency, is being driven out of the power sector by cheaper
renewables and gas and now faces an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
regulation, finalized last week, that demands all coal plants not retiring by
2039 to slash their carbon emissions 90% within the coming decade.

            <p>The British brand has entered the booming market in luxury ‘car-chitecture’,
opening a themed tower in Miami boasting ballroom, helipad and infinity pool –
all offering millionaires a perfect view of our choking, collapsing world

Move over, James Bond – a new Aston Martin has rolled into town, brimming with
more flashy features than Q could ever dream of. Parked ostentatiously on the
Miami waterfront, overlooking a private marina brimming with superyachts, its
streamlined flanks glisten in the Florida sunshine, housing an interior
trimmed with the finest leathers and exotic wood veneers. There’s no ejector
seat or rocket-launcher, but it is the biggest Aston Martin ever made –
housing Jacuzzi, bar, cinema, golf simulator, art gallery, ballroom and
infinity pool, all crowned with a 66th-storey helipad.

Unveiled in the week of the Miami Grand Prix, the latest exclusive model from
the timeless British automotive brand is not a high-performance sports car,
but an ultra-luxury apartment building – the tallest residential tower in the
US, south of New York. After Aston Martin’s years of financial woes, following
a disastrous stock market performance since the company’s 2018 listing, it
seems that the boutique car-  
maker is seeking salvation in property development.

The mining company BHP has said it hopes to secure a $25.7bn (£20bn)

in companies they say are complicit in war in Gaza

As protests against Israel’s offensive in Gaza are spreading throughout
American campuses, one demand made by students across schools keeps coming up:
divestment from Israel.

Universities rely on endowments to fund things like research and scholarships,
and those endowments are typically invested in companies and alternative asset
classes, such as private equity and hedge funds.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
