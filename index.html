Rupert Murdoch is set to be questioned under oath on Tuesday and Wednesday as
part of voting technology company Smartmatic’s $2.7bn defamation lawsuit
against Fox Corp over coverage of debunked vote-rigging claims involving the
2020 US presidential election, a person familiar with the matter said.

Murdoch will be deposed in Los Angeles, according to that person, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The deposition does not appear on the public docket
for the case.

Lego play sets have captivated children and adults alike for decades, but
engineers at Legoland California are dealing with blocks of a different kind:
opposition from management and hired union avoidance consultants trying to
deter their bid to formally unionize.

Ride technician engineers at Legoland in Carlsbad, California, filed for a
union election to join International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers (IAMAW), District Lodge 947 in September. They await a ruling by the
National Labor Relations Board on accepting their bargaining unit, and
permitting the election to be scheduled.

            <p>Michael Schuls died after getting trapped in dangerous machinery at a mill in
Wisconsin. But across the US conservative groups are pushing to loosen laws
that protect children in the workplace

In late June, Jim Schuls and his 16-year-old son, Michael, woke up at 4am for
their usual drive from their apartment in Florence, Wisconsin, to begin work
at 5am at a sawmill. Father and son made this journey together five times a
week in the summer, when Michael worked longer hours than he did in term time.
His two older brothers had also worked at the same mill when they were about
his age.

Their day at Florence Hardwoods – one of the largest employers in the town
with a population of about 2,000 – began as normal. Jim operated a forklift
outside while Michael worked alone inside the mill. Jim says he never worried
because he believed “young kids were stacking lumber”, not operating dangerous
machines.

            <p>Prices are starting to level out, with some toys, electronics and apparel

Some good news for the holiday season: shopping for gifts this year will
probably be a bit cheaper than last year. The bad news? Consumers just aren’t
feeling the holiday cheer – and with good reason.

After over a year of high inflation, prices in the US are starting to level
out, with drops in prices of some goods. The cost of a dozen eggs went from an
average of $4.83 down to an average of $2.07 this October. Gas prices
surpassed $5 a gallon in summer 2022, and are now down to a national average
of $3.30.

            <p>In this week’s newsletter: Changpeng Zhao has pleaded guilty to breaking US
anti-money-laundering laws but will the enforcement end there?

 **•Don’t get TechScape delivered to your inbox? Sign up here**

Binance is guilty. The world’s largest crypto exchange admitted to a range of
violations in a massive US court action, including unlicensed money
transmitting, sanctions violations and anti-money laundering (AML) violations.
Its founder, Changpeng Zhao, near-universally known as CZ, personally pled
guilty to his failure to maintain money-laundering controls.

The failures “allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child
abusers through its platform”, the US secretary of the treasury, Janet Yellen,
said. From our story:

As part of a guilty plea, Zhao agreed to pay a $50m fine and would be barred
from any involvement in the business. Binance too agreed to plead guilty,
accept the appointment of a monitor and pay a criminal fine of nearly $1.81bn
as well as a $2.51bn order of forfeiture to settle three criminal charges.

Zhao wrote in a tweet: “Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. … I made
mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for
Binance, and for myself … I can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup
again.”

On March 8, 2022, one of these video-conference meetings was scheduled. Mr
Moniruzzaman, now employed by Nvidia, attended the video-conference call… and
shared his computer screen during the call. When he minimized the PowerPoint
presentation he had been sharing, however, he revealed one of Valeo’s verbatim
source code files open on his computer. So brazen was Mr Moniruzzaman’s theft,
the file path on his screen still read “ValeoDocs.” Valeo participants on the
video-conference call immediately recognized the source code and took a
screenshot before Mr Moniruzzaman was alerted of his error. By then it was too
late to cover his tracks.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
