In the aftermath of far-right activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination, dozens
across the United States have been fired, suspended or disciplined over social
media posts about Kirk and his death, as employers and public officials crack
down on remarks they deem “inappropriate”.

After Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on 10 September while speaking at Utah
Valley University, members of the Trump administration called on the public to
expose anyone appearing to be “celebrating” his killing.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

            <p>The president’s claim that undermining his tariffs would ‘literally destroy’
the country gets the situation backwards

Just hours after an appeals court ruled that it was illegal for Donald Trump
to impose his unpopular across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries, he
posted a frantic, over-the-top rant that declared: “If allowed to stand, this
Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”

So here the president of the United States was asserting that if the courts
torpedoed his tariffs, then the US, the most powerful nation on earth, would
be destroyed, would “literally” be kaput. Trump seemed to suggest that court
rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of,
say, 100 hydrogen bombs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
