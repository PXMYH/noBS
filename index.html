            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The league has ended its resistance to institutional capital. The Premier
League has shown the chaos and rot that the relationship can bring

The last of the holdouts has fallen. A few weeks ago, the National Football
League passed a resolution to allow private equity investment in individual
teams, thereby bringing to an end to the league’s long resistance to the
incursion of institutional capital. The NFL joins the National Basketball
Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and Major League
Soccer, all of which have opened up to institutional investment in recent
years. Only one of the league’s 32 owners, the Cincinnati Bengals’ Mike Brown,
voted against the proposal – a decision, reports suggest, born of his
longstanding desire to maintain the financial viability of smaller franchises
in a league where growth in team valuations and media revenues shows no sign
of slowing down.

The effects of the new ownership regime will be minimal, for now at least. The
NFL will not be transformed overnight from a league in which teams are owned
by wealthy individuals and families and managed for the benefit of fans and
communities to one run according to the whims of private equity’s bullies and
money grubbers. But it seems hard to imagine that a shift of this nature won’t
take shape eventually. The league has been careful to limit the initial scope
of private equity investment in the league: individual funds can buy no more
than 10% in a given franchise; will acquire purely passive stakes, stripped of
any decision-making, governance or voting rights; and will have to hold on to
their investments for at least six years. Only four participating funds are
allowed to invest for now; they are all long-dated (meaning they generally
have long investment horizons and are not, in theory, looking to generate
quick returns) and have a lot of money to burn. Sovereign wealth funds, asset
management firms, endowments, and pension funds are barred from investing in
the league – a marked contrast to the NBA, which opened up to this bigger
class of investors in 2022.

            <p>Strike – the first by port workers on US east coast since 1977 – threatens to
shut down ports from Maine to Texas

Joe Biden has urged port operators to give workers a “meaningful increase” in
pay after tens of thousands went on strike, prompting some of the busiest
ports in the US to brace for crippling disruption.

About 45,000 port workers represented by the International Longshoremen’s
Association (ILA) began walking off the job after their contracts expired at
midnight, with 36 ports along the east and Gulf coasts affected. They
typically handle about half of the nation’s ocean shipping.

Qatar Airways plans to buy a 25% stake in Virgin Australia from its private
equity owner, in a deal set to shake up the local aviation market by

The proposed sale will allow Virgin to start offering long-haul flights for

domestic market. It also bolsters the airline’s loyalty program against
Qantas’s rival points offering.

The Monongahela River winds through the tight Mon Valley south of Pittsburgh,

In the weeks preceding the election, the region is once again playing an
outsize role in determining the nation’s political future. A controversial
Biden-Harris administration plan to kill Pittsburgh-based US Steel’s proposed

A deal backed by leaders on both sides of Libya’s political divide to appoint
a new central bank governor has the potential “to resolve all the political
issues” in the country, Libya’s head of state has said.

Mohamed al-Menfi, the president of Libya’s Presidential Council who is largely

fled into exile.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Jeffrey L Bowman’s Reframe consultancy is using artificial intelligence to
help with engaging employees with diversity programming or making a budget for
DEI work

With its focus on remedying historical and economic inequities, DEI has become
an unassailable component of American life. The ideological framework – more
formally known as diversity, equity and inclusion – is now a standard element
of how businesses are run and students are taught. (It’s also become a
weaponized term, as was the case when a New York Post column said that Kamala
Harris would be a “DEI president”.)

Nearly $350bn flowed into DEI and racial justice initiatives during the two
years following the 2020 murder George Floyd, according to a report by
McKinsey. The DEI industry – mostly consultants whose work focuses on helping
organizations review and revise their spending, recruiting and hiring
practices – is worth close to $10bn. But over the past few years, DEI programs
have been dramatically downsized. Universities such as Harvard and MIT are now
scrapping mandatory DEI statements and companies ranging from Nordstrom to
Salesforce are slashing related budgets and staffing targets.

Workers have manned a picket line outside Boeing’s airplane factory in Renton,
Washington, around the clock since tens of thousands walked off the job
earlier this month. Almost two weeks into the strike, the largest now under
way in the US, nobody knows when it will end.

Orlando, a quality inspector at the aerospace giant, arrived at 3.45am on
Saturday, long before dawn. On the outskirts of a city as expensive as
Seattle, the cost of living is “always going up”, he said. “And I guess the
biggest part is making sure our wages reflect that.”

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
