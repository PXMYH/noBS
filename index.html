  *  **World economy resilient amid Trump tariffs but outlook looks ‘dim’, says IMF**

  *  **Why has US-China trade war restarted and how have markets reacted?**

 **A flurry of takeover talk speculation has pushed up shares in budget
airline EasyJet this morning.**

 **EasyJet’s** shares are up over 7%, leading the risers on the **FTSE**
**100** share index.

appropriately reflects actual customer loss or achieves a proportionate
outcome.

“...the FCA’s proposed approach to assessing unfairness does not align with
the legal clarity provided by the supreme court judgement in respect of the
“Johnson” case, which confirmed that the test for unfairness is highly fact

liabilities exist no matter what.

“We believe our scheme is the best way to settle the issue for both consumers
and firms, and alternatives would be more costly and take longer. We recognise
not everyone will get everything they would like. But it’s vital we draw a
line under the issue so a trusted motor finance market can continue to serve
millions of families every year.”

In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested that furloughed

Many travellers to Europe will see changes in border security from Sunday with

The system means most non-EU citizens will have to register their biometric
information at the border. Travellers’ faces will have to be photographed and

The swish seafront hotels and freshly planted palms on the gleaming promenade

But step out the back door and the resort is still firmly, as it is better
known, Magaluf: boozed-up Britain in Spain, with cocktails by the pint.

Mallorca got most of the Balearics’ 3.5 million UK visitors last year: for
some residents, far too many. The island has become emblematic of the most
heated debate in travel: overtourism – and how to tackle it.

The government shutdown may have prevented the publication of September’s job
report, but we can be reasonably confident that when the numbers are known,
they will further underscore the Trump administration’s policy incoherence and
remind us of all of the damage he is prepared to inflict on the American
economy.

The president will most likely be apoplectic over data confirming that the
economy is generating very few new jobs (the payroll processor ADP estimated a
loss of 32,000 private sector jobs in September). Trump fired the head of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs numbers, after a
lackluster report published in August.

            <p>Tariffs have caused a Chinese exit from the soybean market – and midwestern
farmers are waiting on a solution

At the Purfeerst farm in southern Minnesota, the soybean harvest just wrapped
up for the season. The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of
soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece.

This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods
depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck
in the middle of a trade war between the US and China, the biggest purchaser
of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs.

A small flotilla of gaily coloured fishing boats line the shingle beach at

waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish
stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell
some of the day’s catch.

This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats
have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that

fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
