demand for big, centralized workplaces and retail spaces. As prices tanked,

grinding 15 hours.

But when Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven counts of wire fraud and

Netflix recently announced another price increase. It was just a couple of
bucks. No big deal, right? Wrong.

This price increase comes after another announced increase back in 2022 and
this time actually ranges from 16% to 20% depending on the service. Why is
Netflix doing this? Because it can. Netflix is no dummy. It knows that almost
all of its customers will stick with the service even though it’s costing a
little more. And they’re right. I love Netflix, so I’m going to pay.

wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little

The former president spent decades trying to create excitement with wonderful

The American buff goose. Amish deer tongue lettuce. The Nancy Hall sweet

fantastical-sounding ingredients in a database of vanishing foods called the
Ark of Taste, she set off on a journey across the United States to discover
more ingredients and traditions that had been abandoned in the annals of
history.

The endeavor was the latest installment of a storied career that has included
cooking 19th-century recipes at a living history museum and chronicling
American cuisine in her book Eight Flavors, which documents how foods like
black pepper and sriracha have helped reshape what Americans eat.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has vowed to boost cooperation with
Kazakhstan at a time of “multiple crises in the world” as he began a trip to
central Asia, a region long regarded as Russia’s back yard, which has drawn
fresh western attention since the war in Ukraine began.

At a meeting with Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Macron
complimented the country for refusing to side with Moscow on Ukraine and
announced business deals, including a declaration of intent for a partnership
in the much-sought area of rare earths and rare metals.

Thousands of workers at Britain’s biggest steelworks in Port Talbot have been
left in limbo after the plant’s owner delayed an announcement on job cuts that
was expected to cause as many as 3,000 posts to be lost from the UK workforce.

The Welsh town, which grew up around the steelworks, had been braced for
confirmation of the closures of the two blast furnaces after a meeting of the
Tata Steel board on Wednesday, in what would have marked the beginning of a
major retrenchment in UK steelmaking.

            <p>The United Auto Workers have scored a major victory. And it could be a sign of
more to come for workers – unless the Fed undermines them again

The United Auto Workers has scored a major victory. It’s still awaiting a vote
by union members, but it’s a big deal – a 25% wage increase over the four and
a half years of the contract, cost-of-living increases that will further
ratchet up hourly pay, the right to strike over plant closures and a shorter
time period for workers to reach top pay.

If the victory ripples across the auto industry and encourages wage increases
in other sectors, it will also be a victory for the American middle class.

the University of California at Berkeley

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
