A few hundred metres from her house, Rosemary Lewis stands at a clearing on a

that could become home to UK’s largest solar farm. With plans to install 2.5m
solar panels along an 11-mile (18km) stretch north of Oxford, the Botley West
solar farm would be vast.

The proposal is one of 30 large-scale solar projects vying for approval, which
could give the UK a much-needed shot in the arm to achieve its climate goals
of generating 100% clean electricity by 2035 and reaching net zero greenhouse
gas emissions by 2050.

The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, a sign the labor market remained

economy. The report offered a mixed view of the jobs market. The unemployment
rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022, up from 3.9% in April.

promotional book tour.

“I love the personal connection,” she says. “So when I was given the

Boeing’s largest factory is in “panic mode”, according to workers and union
officials, with managers accused of hounding staff to keep quiet over quality
concerns.

The US plane maker has been grappling with a safety crisis sparked by a cabin
panel blowout during a flight in January, and intense scrutiny of its
production line as regulators launched a string of investigations.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
