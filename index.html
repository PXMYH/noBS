US consumer confidence plunged to the lowest level in more than four years in

because of tariffs.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday that write-in responses to the survey
showed “worries about the impact of trade policies and tariffs in particular
are on the rise”, adding: “There were also more references than usual to
economic and policy uncertainty.”

Elon Musk appears to be laying the groundwork to privatize some space and
satellite operations now under the authority of National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), or steer lucrative contracts toward his
SpaceX and Starlink companies, former agency employees say.

They’re sounding the alarm as at least four other federal agencies have
reportedly begun pushing new contracts toward Musk’s Starlink satellite
internet company. Musk, the world’s richest man, has been tasked by Donald
Trump with drastically slashing the federal government workforce and costs.

  * Photographs by Haron Forteau  

It is hard to describe the putrid stench of the decaying sargassum seaweed
blanketing miles of shoreline in Soubise, a fishing village in Grenada. The
pungent odour wafts into passing vehicles, persisting long after they have
left the Caribbean island’s coves, where the ocean has deposited masses of the
seaweed, which turns red then black as it rots.

Many residents of Soubise, one of the areas worst affected, say they have
learned to live with the problem, which has plagued the island, and others
like it, for years. Last week scientists in Florida said they thought they had
identified a weather phenomenon in 2009 as the “tipping point” of the problem,
which they said is caused by shifting winds churning up the ocean and bringing
deepwater nutrient concentrations to the surface.

Globalisation “may have now run its course” in its current form, according to
the chair of HSBC, as geopolitical tensions and US tariffs threaten to upend
existing global trade.

Speaking at the bank’s global investment summit in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Sir
Mark Tucker warned that trade tensions created uncertainty that posed a
“serious potential risk to global growth”, in remarks reported by the
Financial Times. He predicted stronger economic ties would develop between
regional groups and trade blocs.

  * Business live – latest updates

The Irish government has warned that the country could lose up to 80,000 jobs
if Donald Trump launches a trade war with the EU, and has hit back at
accusations by the US that Ireland is operating a “tax scam”.

The jobs estimate represents almost half the workforce in Ireland’s
multinational sector, which the US president is expected to target as part of
an effort to repatriate jobs and taxes.

The chief executive of Heathrow has defended the running of the airport after
a fire at an electrical substation stopped about 1,300 planes and disrupted
the journeys of hundreds of thousands of global passengers.

It comes after Willie Walsh, the International Air Transport Association’s
director general, criticised Heathrow for the disruption, while the energy
secretary, Ed Miliband, has now ordered the National Energy System Operator to
“urgently investigate” the outage.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>International trade boomed with the city’s early adoption of technological and
economic changes, but Black neighborhoods became ‘sacrifice zones’

Oakland, California, is often treated as a city on the margins, best known for
its struggles with poverty and gun violence, as well as for its history of
radical Black activism. But a new book, The Pacific Circuit, argues that
Oakland should be viewed as one of the centers of global change in the past
century, serving both as a key node in the new global economy built around
trans-Pacific trade, and as one of the “sacrifice zones” this economy
requires.

Far from being an outlier, US journalist Alexis Madrigal argues, Oakland is in
fact an early adopter of the technological and economic changes now tearing
through cities across the US, and around the world. Oakland has long been the
canary in Silicon Valley’s coalmine of disruption, the book suggests. But its
residents don’t suffer passively: they organize and learn how to fight back.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
