 **Newsflash: Inflation across the eurozone fell by more than initially
thought last month, which may cement the chances of interest rate cuts
today.**

Consumer prices across the euro area rose by 1.7% in the year to September,

Thompson was pleased enough with the results to post a photo of her creation
on Facebook. Within a few weeks, 10 friends and family members placed orders

Walgreens Boots Alliance said on Tuesday it would shut 1,200 stores over the

struggling pharmacy chain operator hit by sluggish consumer spending and low

Boeing is seeking to raise up to $25bn (£19bn) in an attempt to shore up its
finances as the planemaker struggles with production delays amid a strike by
33,000 workers and ongoing safety concerns.

A regulatory filing by the company on Tuesday said it intended to raise the
money through a stock and debt offering, which would provide flexibility for
Boeing to seek options to support its balance sheet over a three-year period.

Climate campaigners have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission to investigate whether “fly carbon neutral” and other

The greenwashing complaint, filed by the Environmental Defenders Office on
behalf of research and advocacy organisation Climate Integrity, urged the
competition watchdog to investigate the airline’s marketing materials and the
credibility of the company’s transition to net zero.

The EU’s plans to ban the manufacture of traditional combustion engines from

Taiwan is expected to have access to low earth orbit satellite internet
service by the end of the month, a step the government says is crucial in case
a Chinese attack cripples the island’s communications.

The forthcoming service is via a contract between Taiwan’s main telecoms
company, Chunghwa, and a UK-European company, Eutelsat OneWeb, signed last
year, and marks a new milestone in Taiwan’s efforts to address technological
vulnerabilities, particularly its internet access, after attempts to get
access to Elon Musk’s Starlink service collapsed.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
