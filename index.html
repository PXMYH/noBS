Thirty-six hours by boat from Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, Deodato
Alves da Silva longs for enough electricity to keep his tucumã and cupuaçu

it hard to sell their produce.

Silva’s fruit-growing operation is located in the village of Boa Frente, in
Novo Aripuanã municipality, one of Brazil’s most energy-poor regions, where
there is only one diesel-powered electricity generator working for a few hours
a day.

Major egg corporations may be using avian flu as a ruse to hike up prices,
generating record profits while hurting American consumers, new research
suggests.

The cost of a dozen large eggs hit almost $5 in January – a record high in the
US and more than two and a half times the average price three years ago before
the avian flu outbreak. This signifies a 157% inflation rate for eggs – a
previously go-to affordable protein source for many American families.

Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said on Sunday that government
spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response
to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by the billionaire
businessman Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge)
could possibly cause an economic downturn.

“You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,” Lutnick said on

IRS Direct File program that allows for free online tax filings. It has been a

associates who holds a key position in the GSA informed staffers that the
agency would close 18F in an email to staffers that arrived around 1am on
Saturday morning.

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his

was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
