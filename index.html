            <p>CEO of DeepMind is ‘not a pessimist’ but warns of threat from AI and says we
must be active in shaping ‘a middle way’

  * AI risk must be treated as seriously as climate crisis, says Google DeepMind chief

Demis Hassabis says he is not in the “pessimistic” camp about artificial
intelligence. But that did not stop the CEO of Google DeepMind signing a
statement in May warning that the threat of extinction from AI should be
treated as a societal risk comparable to pandemics or nuclear weapons.

That uneasy gap between hope and horror, and the desire to bridge it, is a key
reason why Rishi Sunak convened next week’s global AI safety summit in
Bletchley Park, a symbolic choice as the base of the visionary codebreakers –
including computing pioneer Alan Turing – who deciphered German communications
during the second world war.

Bank of England policymakers are expected to hold interest rates at their

showed signs of slowing down.

Official figures released on Tuesday indicated that the unemployment rate rose
to 4.2% between June and August, up from 4% in the March-to-May quarter.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Increased militancy after pandemic sacrifices and tighter labor market
contributed to impressive contract deals in last year

Call it the Great Reset. Across the US, labor unions are winning surprisingly
large contract settlements as workers have reset their expectations to demand
considerably more than they did just a few years ago, and that has in turn
pressured many corporations to reset – and increase – the pay packages they
are giving in union contracts.

The result has been a wave of impressive – sometimes eye-popping – union
contracts over the past year, far more generous than in recent decades. In
August, 15,000 American Airlines pilots won pay increases of 46% over four
years. In a huge labor confrontation last summer, 340,000 Teamster members at
UPS won raises of $7.50 an hour over five years, with drivers’ pay climbing to
$49 an hour and part-time workers receiving a pay increase of 48% on average.

            <p>Believe it or not, battery-powered vehicles have been around since Victorian
times – everything from private automobiles to taxis, ambulances and
tricycles. We’ve got the photos to prove it

The history of the electric car is surprisingly enraging. If you imagine early
electric vehicles at all (full disclosure: I didn’t until recently), it will
probably be as the quixotic and possibly dangerous dream of a few eccentrics,
maybe in the 1920s or 1930s, when domestic electrification became widespread.
It’s easy to imagine some stiff-collared proto-Musk getting bored of hunting
and affairs, eyeing his newly installed electric lights speculatively, then
wreaking untold havoc and mass electrocutions.

The reality is entirely different. By 1900, a third of all cars on the road in
the US were electric; we’re looking at the history of a cruelly missed
opportunity, and it started astonishingly early. The Scottish engineer Robert
Anderson had a go at an electric car of sorts way back in the 1830s, though
his invention was somewhat stymied by the fact rechargeable batteries were not
invented until 1859, making his crude carriage something of a one-trick pony
(and far less useful than an actual pony).

A corporate lobbying group backed by Koch Industries is quietly pressing the
Democratic New York governor, Kathy Hochul, not to sign a landmark
transparency bill unmasking the owners of shell corporations involved in
financial crimes, wage theft and tenant abuses.

High-profile real estate donors to Hochul’s campaign also oppose new
disclosure requirements for limited liability companies, or LLCs, a
notoriously opaque corporate structure that can thwart attempts at both civil
and criminal law enforcement by concealing owners’ true identities.

I’m in a moral quandary about a story circulating this week about a Citibank
analyst who was fired because he was caught charging the company for a two-
sandwich lunch he had with his partner without authorization … and then
subsequently lying about it.

The analyst, Szabolcs Fekete, was fired for gross misconduct after initially

More than six months after Sydney businessman Alexander Csergo was arrested on
allegations he was providing sensitive material to Chinese agents, Australia’s
attorney general has still not consented to his prosecution.

Lawyers for Csergo say he is being used as a “guinea pig” on a never-before-
proven charge, and will seek to have him released on bail after prosecutors
secured more time to confirm the charge against him.

A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies singles out which 100

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
