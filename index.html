undermining the checks and balances of the federal government.

The secretaries warned that the administration had compromised roles
historically given to non-partisan career civil servants and had replaced them
with “political actors”, according to a New York Times op-ed published on
Monday. The secretaries specifically called into question Elon Musk’s so-
called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, and the appointees that
Musk has installed within agencies, including the treasury department.

            <p>Case against Frank founder Charlie Javice for allegedly defrauding JP Morgan
has been compared to that of Theranos’ Elizabeth Holmes

  * Business live – latest updates

Charlie Javice has joined an undesirable club struck by the “Forbes 30 Under
30 curse”, a term for the high-flyers identified by the business title as up-
and-comers who ended up in legal trouble. The entrepreneur has joined a list
that includes the pharmaceuticals fraudster Martin Shkreli and FTX’s Sam
Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison.

The strength of the Forbes “curse” will be tested this week in New York as
Javice, 31, goes on trial on four counts of fraud relating to the $175m
(£141m) sale of Frank, a student financial aid application assistance company
she founded aged 24, to JP Morgan Chase. The deal quickly soured, and has
descended into a legal wrangle that has been compared to the case of Theranos
founder Elizabeth Holmes.

new development opportunities

Shortly after his election as mayor of Atlanta in 2021, Andre Dickens realized
one of his core campaign promises – to create 20,000 new units of affordable
housing – might be hard to keep. Estimates from his staff showed the city
would fall more than 4,000 units short.

His options seemed limited. The low-income housing tax credit supports the
building or restoration of much affordable housing in America, but the federal
tax incentive is curbed by volume caps each year, and voters are often
skeptical of other potential sources of funding, such as bonds.

moved the goalpost at least three times in two weeks

Donald Trump was in his element in the Oval Office this week. Surrounded by
cameras, flanked by billionaire allies and confronted by a barrage of
questions about whether he was really prepared to unleash a trade war on the
US’s closest neighbors, the president talked tough.

By his telling, powerful economies were scrambling to bend to his will. Hours
earlier, Mexico had announced a series of measures to shore up its border,
prompting the White House to hastily postpone the imposition of 25% tariffs on
all its goods; Canada would announce similar measures, and receive the same
reprieve, later that day.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
