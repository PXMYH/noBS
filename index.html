faces property crisis and weak demand

The World Bank has lifted its growth forecasts for China’s economy, but called

The 112-acre Silicon Valley property became a retreat for members of the
“naturist” movement in 1935. Today, its hundreds of members enjoy the resort’s
clothing-optional hiking trails, pickleball court and its nude-only community
pool. (Yes: the members really do hike naked.)

Australia is expected to welcome a record number of Chinese tourists this
summer amid a surge in new air routes between the two countries, adding to
what is already set to be a busy – and potentially chaotic – holiday period.

On Tuesday, Juneyao Airlines became the eighth carrier based in mainland China
to run flights to Australia, with the launch of its Sydney-Shanghai route,
before its Melbourne-Shanghai service starts on Friday.

            <p>Largest private employer in US pledged to tackle inequities after George Floyd
murder but has now dropped initiatives

A year after the murder of George Floyd, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart had a
warning for corporate America. The death of Floyd triggered a wave of protest
over systemic racism and was “not an isolated event. We have a long history of
racism, and we see unacceptable events continue.”

Walmart and other large US corporations made pledges to address inequities
within their business, ones many feared would be dropped once the focus on
Floyd’s killing and its aftermath faded. “We can’t let that be the case,” he
wrote, outlining how the company was releasing its “diversity metrics twice a
year” and calling on companies to “continue to address systemic racism and the
structural inequities that are rooted in this nation’s history of slavery and
that persist today”.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
