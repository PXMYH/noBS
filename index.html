Debt-laden Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday and said it

Seven of the biggest US-headquartered tech companies, including Apple,
Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet, are estimated to have paid £750m in UK
corporation tax and the digital sales tax, compared with £2.8bn in estimated
tax due had profits not been routed elsewhere, according to TaxWatch, a

As Disney celebrates a glittering century of global success this week, behind
closed doors its top executives are contemplating what could be the most
radical shake-up in the history of the world’s biggest entertainment company.

Bob Iger, Disney’s Mr Fixit, made a shock return as chief executive last
November after the ousting of his hand-picked successor, Bob Chapek, following
a disastrous reign lasting less than two years. The challenges facing Iger are
myriad and formidable.

Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani has informed Manchester United’s owners, the
Glazers, that he has withdrawn from the process to buy the club, viewing their
valuation as highly unrealistic when compared to his £5bn-plus final offer.
This leaves Sir Jim Ratcliffe as the only other publicly declared interested
potential purchaser.

The decision will come as a bitter blow to the large constituency of United
supporters who remain deeply unhappy with the Glazers’ ownership due to the
near-£1bn debt the club has been saddled with.

netted an illicit haul worth €300,000

The Polygyros olive oil cooperative does not seem a likely target for a heist.
If anything, its setting, at the foot of the Holomontas mountain in Halkidiki,
evokes the bucolic innocence of rural Greece.

Certainly its breezeblock warehouses bear little resemblance to the modern
premises that house the Mitseas olive mills in southern Messinia. But in
recent weeks both have been targeted by thieves, who gained entry through a

            <p>A new housing development outside Phoenix is looking towards European cities
for inspiration and shutting out the cars. So far residents love it

If you were to imagine the first car-free neighborhood built from scratch in
the modern US, it would be difficult to conceive such a thing sprouting from
the environs of Phoenix, Arizona – a sprawling, concrete incursion into a
brutal desert environment that is sometimes derided as the least sustainable
city in the country.

But it is here that such a neighborhood, called Culdesac, has taken root. On a
17-acre site that once contained a car body shop and some largely derelict
buildings, an unusual experiment has emerged that invites Americans to live in
a way that is rare outside of fleeting experiences of college, Disneyland or
trips to Europe: a walkable, human-scale community devoid of cars.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
