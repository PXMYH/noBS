            <p>Donald Trump says he will cut fentanyl tariff on Chinese goods and expects
‘great deal’ with Xi Jinping

The US chipmaker **Nvidia** is on track to become the first $5tn company when
Wall Street opens later, after receiving a boost from Donald Trump remarks and
amid an AI boom.

The shares rose by 3.9% in premarket trading, and if this is sustained, Nvidia

  * Business live – latest updates

Boeing pushed the first delivery of its long-delayed 777X jet program out to
2027 and took a nearly $5bn charge due to the delays, in another series of
setbacks for the aerospace giant.

The 777X was central to Boeing’s long-term widebody strategy, previously
dominated by its 747 and 777 jets. But repeated certification and production
delays have pushed back deliveries by years, piling up charges of more than
$15bn and straining its finances, while giving an opening to rival Airbus’s
competing A350 as international travel continues to rise.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
