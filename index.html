  * Travel chaos as Heathrow airport closes after blaze at electrical substation

 **Borrowing overshoot will test Rachel Reeves’s resolve on tax rises**

February’s public finances data, published on Friday, is only likely to make
Rachel Reeves more convinced that she needs to take action at next Wednesday’s
spring statement.

The fire in Heathrow is having a big effect on the airline sector in Europe
and elsewhere.

 **IAG** , the owner of **BA** and **Iberia** , is down more than 3%, while
**KLM-Air** **France** is also lower by 1.5% so far.

The disruption caused by the Heathrow closure for the entire day on Friday is
huge, but it will be temporary, and we expect airline stocks to stabilise
after an initial knee jerk sell off.

The airline sector is fragile now, due to concerns about a US recession and a
weak global consumer.

  * Business live – latest updates

A trade war between the US and the EU could cost Ireland more than €18bn
(£15bn), trigger waves of job losses and cause US multinationals to relocate,
according to a report co-authored by the Irish government.

Ireland’s GDP could shrink by 3.7% over the next five to seven years under the
worst-case scenario, in which Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on all exports
on the EU and the EU retaliated with counter-tariffs, the study carried by the

Prospects for the US economy have cooled significantly in a matter of months.
After outperforming its international peers last year, warning lights are
flashing on a dashboard of economic indicators as analysts warn that Donald
Trump’s erratic approach is hitting the world’s largest economy.

Fears of a US recession this year are growing, in what is being called a
“Trumpcession”, amid a sharp decline in business and consumer confidence as
the president threatens punitive import tariffs on US allies and enemies
alike.

Canada is the “most European of the non-European countries”, Mark Carney said
during his first overseas trip as prime minister to France and the UK, where
he is seeking stronger alliances to deal with Donald Trump’s attacks on his
country’s sovereignty and economy.

Without mentioning the US president by name, Carney and the French president,
Emmanuel Macron, made a joint appearance in Paris to show a united stance
against what they said were economic and geopolitical crises – a reference to
Trump’s trade war and “America first” diplomacy that has left longtime allies
scrambling.

  * Business live – latest updates

China’s government has announced ambitious plans to “vigorously boost
consumption” by putting up pay and reducing financial burdens, in its latest
attempt to increase consumer confidence and lift its struggling economy.

The plans, announced by the ruling Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) central
committee and state council on Sunday, include aims to “promote reasonable
wage growth” and to improve the mechanisms for adjusting the minimum wage.

            <p>Women’s goods are taxed at a higher rate than men’s, an invisible bias that is
estimated to cost women $2.5bn a year

Many shoppers know about the so-called pink tax – a needless markup on
products marketed to women, even if those products are essentially the same,
just cheaper, when sold to men. Personal care items such as razors, deodorants
and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink
tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.

Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at
the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized
sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

art of making beer.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
