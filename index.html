The European pharmaceutical industry has condemned the US move to put 15%
tariffs on medicines imported from the EU, calling the taxes a “blunt
instrument” that would harm patients on both sides of the Atlantic.

They were responding to a White House text of the deal that inferred the 15%
baseline rate on imports from the EU would also apply to drugs if the
agreement is implemented on the US side on Friday as expected.

            <p>A new analysis suggests Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs could increase factory costs by
2% to 4.5%

As Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his
policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector
that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory
costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%.

“There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris
Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth
who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with
slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages,
if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable.

The Washington-based organisation said a “de-escalation in tariffs” by the
White House had spurred a recovery in global trade and a broader economic
expansion, though US policies remain “highly uncertain” and risks to growth
“firmly on the downside”.

Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
