Google announced this week that it would begin the international rollout of
its new artificial intelligence-powered search feature, called AI Overviews.
When billions of people search a range of topics from news to recipes to
general knowledge questions, what they see first will now be an AI-generated
summary.

Google touted AI Overviews at its annual I/O developer conference as a way of
delivering customers quick answers and simplifying the online search
experience, but it also has another effect on the way that people engage with
the internet: keeping users, and advertisers, on Google.com. It’s a new era in
Google’s years-long quest for your attention.

Just this past week I stopped by a local convenience store around 6am for a
coffee before a long drive. The store at that time was – unsurprisingly –
filled with contractors doing the same before their early-morning jobs
started. Most of the contractors that I saw were younger and in their 20s. It
was noticeable. And apparently, I’m not the only one noticing.

According to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, a growing number of
gen-Zers are flocking to the construction trade.

            <p>Last summer’s strikes, as writers and actors took on the studios, led to
historic change – but how is the industry faring now?

Fans of Pete Davidson who tuned in to watch him host Saturday Night Live were
disappointed to find a rerun instead. Viewers of Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon
and Jimmy Kimmel found they too had gone dark. While late-night TV had found
ingenious ways to stay on air during a global pandemic, this was different.

It was a year ago this month that screenwriters hit the picket lines. Actors
followed suit with a walkout in mid-July, the first time that the two unions
had been on strike together since 1960. As Hollywood came to a standstill,

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
