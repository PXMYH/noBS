A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

Amazon will lay off several hundred employees in its streaming and studio
operations, according to an internal note sent on Wednesday. The announcement
came the same day as the live-streaming company Twitch, a subsidiary of the
e-commerce giant, disclosed that it would lay off about 35% of its workforce,
or 500 employees.

Amazon last year cut more than 27,000 jobs as part of a wave of US tech
layoffs, drawing a sharp line under the industry’s recruitment spree during
the pandemic. It was far from alone. Facebook and Microsoft each laid off
10,000 workers last year; Google cut 12,000.

            <p>Brazilian-born Nemuel DePaula wants his Lenita flower truck business to
blossom in its brick-and-mortar location

Nemuel DePaula has never been afraid of big pivots. The Brazil native
immigrated to Boston at age 10, started his own graphic design business,
Grita, while still in high school, and moved himself and the business across
the country to Los Angeles in 2013. Four years later, DePaula took a gamble
again with Lenita, the part-time mobile flower shop he launched and named
after his mother.

DePaula, 35, has been captivated by flowers since childhood. “The first thing
I ever stole was a rose,” he said with a laugh as he recalled the perfect
bloom he snipped from his neighbor’s garden and slipped to his mom as a small
child. Over the years, his aesthetic sensibilities evolved from purloined
roses to less conventional species. His latest love is the “graffiti
anthurium”, a tropical flower with a natural paint-splattered effect that
resembles a bloodied orchid – but in a cool way.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
