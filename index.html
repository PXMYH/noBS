            <p>Justice department lawsuit alleges tech giant illegally prevented competition
by restricting access to its software and hardware

The US government on Thursday filed a sprawling antitrust case against Apple,
alleging that the tech giant has illegally prevented competition by
restricting access to its software and hardware. The case is a direct
challenge to the company’s core products and practices, including its iMessage
service and how devices such as the iPhone and Apple Watch connect with one
another.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has
monopoly power in the smartphone market and uses its control over the iPhone
to “engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct”. The
complaint states that the case is about “freeing smartphone markets” from
Apple’s anticompetitive practices, arguing that the company has thwarted
innovation to maintain market dominance.

            <p>Reddit, one of the internet’s oldest and most popular social media sites, went
public on March 21. Its IPO was different from most -- which is fitting since
both the company and its user base are rather unusual. Redditors, as the
site’s loyalists are known, have staged open revolts and blackouts to protest
company policies; they’ve also posted personal attacks about company
executives. And now some of those same users have a little power over Reddit:
The company set aside shares for the retail cr

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Reddit’s IPO is worrying for users – big money has a nasty habit of ruining
our favourite sites

Like many people who were laid off and house-bound during the Covid lockdowns,
I spent an unfathomable amount of time learning an arcane skill that in no way
would bolster my CV. Bookbinding was a hobby many of my friends and family
were surprised I’d taken up – I wasn’t particularly skilled with my hands, and
until then my life had largely revolved around technology and the internet.

I spent hours learning complicated stitching techniques, the chemical
composition of adhesives, and how to determine by touch where paper was made.
All of my learning took place on a subreddit – a kind of bulletin board or
forum on the website Reddit – called r/bookbinding, where a small online
community of bookbinders would offer tips and advice on projects I was working
on, completely free of charge. In my mind, it was as good as a pricey art
school, providing a supportive, enthusiastic community that allowed me to
learn the skill at my own pace – and without going bankrupt in the process.  
  
Places like r/bookbinding are increasingly rare in the age of platform-based
social media driven by clickbait, algorithmic recommendations and invasive
advertising designed to keep us scrolling for ever. The internet used to be
full of special-interest forums populated by anonymous users sustaining a
niche community, but most have either shut down or are rarely used. It is on
Reddit, which started life in 2005 as a link-sharing messaging board, where
the last remnants of the forum culture of the old internet remain. But, as it
prepares to make its stock market debut this week, opening itself up to
corporate investment and further venture capital, such communities are at risk
of going extinct entirely.

            <p>Groups of drivers backed a bill setting minimum pay, but the two tech
companies say it’d make riders’ fees unsustainable

Uber and Lyft claim they will cease operating in the Minneapolis area in
protest of a minimum pay ordinance that the city council voted to approve last
week.

The bill, to go into effect on 1 May, would establish a minimum pay of $1.40
per mile and $0.51 cents per minute for rideshare drivers, with a $5 per ride
minimum. The city council voted to override the mayor’s veto of the ordinance,
prompting Uber and Lyft to threaten to leave the region in response.

Labor groups and government officials are pushing to rein in rampant abuses of

One out of every five fish is caught through illegal, unreported and

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
