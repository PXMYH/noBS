Arabia, UAE and other repressive regimes

Public trust in some of the world’s most repressive governments is soaring,
according to Edelman, the world’s largest public relations firm, whose
flagship “trust barometer” has created its reputation as an authority on
global trust. For years, Edelman has reported that citizens of authoritarian
countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and
China, tend to trust their governments more than people living in democracies
do.

But Edelman has been less forthcoming about the fact that some of these same
authoritarian governments have also been its clients. Edelman’s work for one
such client – the government of the UAE – will be front and center when world
leaders convene in Dubai later this month for the UN’s Cop28 climate summit.

            <p>The surprise sacking of the AI venture’s CEO was followed by a near mutiny at
the company and his reinstatement

OpenAI’s messy firing and rehiring of its powerful chief executive this week
shocked the tech world. But the power struggle has implications beyond the
company’s boardroom, AI experts said. It throws into relief the greenness of
the AI industry and the strong desire in Silicon Valley to be first, and
raises urgent questions about the safety of the technology.

“The AI that we’re looking at now is immature. There are no standards, no
professional body, no certifications. Everybody figures out how to do it,
figures out their own internal norms,” said Rayid Ghani, a professor of
machine learning and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. “The AI that
gets built relies on a handful of people who built it, and the impact of these
handfuls of people is disproportionate.”

            <p>French economist says class inequality must be at centre of climate response
and calls for progressive carbon taxes

• Who are the polluter elite and how can we tackle carbon inequality?

Questions of social and economic class must be at the centre of our response
to the climate crisis, to address the huge inequalities between the carbon
footprints of the rich and poor and prevent a backlash against climate
policies, the economist Thomas Piketty has said.

Regulations will be needed to outlaw goods and services that have
unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions, such as private jets, outsized
vehicles, and flights over short distances, he said in an interview with the
Guardian.

A judge has found “reasonable evidence” that Elon Musk and other executives at
Tesla knew that the company’s self-driving technology was defective but still
allowed the cars to be driven in an unsafe manner anyway, according to a
recent ruling issued in Florida.

Palm Beach county circuit court judge Reid Scott said he had found evidence
that Tesla “engaged in a marketing strategy that painted the products as
autonomous” and that Musk’s public statements about the technology “had a
significant effect on the belief about the capabilities of the products”.

£330m contract to create a huge new data platform, leading to privacy concerns
around patients’ medical details.

The move immediately prompted concerns about the security and privacy of

The outcome of the Brexit vote and years of political uncertainty it triggered
has had a chilling impact on business investment in Britain, a deputy governor
of the Bank of England has said.

Dave Ramsden, the Bank’s deputy governor for markets and banking, said the
fallout from the 2016 referendum had “chilled” investment levels compared with
other leading nations and contributed to a lower “speed limit” for the UK
economy.

Social media platforms and tech companies will be required to stamp out
harmful material created using artificial intelligence, such as deep fake
intimate images and hate speech, under new online safety rules from the
federal government.

The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has signalled a suite of
changes are needed to respond to “new and emerging harms”, with the Labor
government expressing significant concern at widely available generative AI
services being used to create offensive or dangerous images, videos and text.

            <p>Does being an effective agency mean helping sell more products or can it mean
helping mitigate climate emergency?

When Bartle Bogle Hegarty won one of the advertising industry’s most coveted
prizes – the Effectiveness award – for their amazing car-selling prowess, two
executives from another company worked out that the resultant carbon emissions
of the extra 132,700 Audis that BBH had managed to shift came to about 5.2m
tonnes, roughly equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions of Uganda.

The work has been a lightning rod in an industry that is deeply divided over
its role in the climate crisis. There is increasing agreement that although
individual behaviour should not be the primary focus for change, _some_
individuals’ behaviour – namely that of the world’s wealthiest people – has a
much bigger impact not only on global emissions but also on broader economic
and political trends. But how should the advertising and PR industries grapple
with the overconsumption of the top 10%?

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
