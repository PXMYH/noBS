            <p>A billionaire’s vendetta has threatened to cut off the US from the ISS and
complicate national defense

After a year of effusive praise and expressions of love for each other, Elon
Musk and Donald Trump exploded their political partnership in dramatic fashion
this week. The highly public split included, among other highlights, the
world’s richest person accusing the president of the United States of
associating with a notorious sex offender. Trump said Musk had “lost his
mind”.

As Musk and Trump traded insults, each on his own social network, they also
issued threats with tangible consequences. Trump suggested that he could
cancel all of Musk’s government contracts and subsidies – “the best way to
save money”, he posted – a move that would have devastating consequences not
only on the tech billionaire’s companies but also on the federal agencies that
have come to depend on them. Musk responded by announcing that he would begin
decommissioning the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that Nasa relies on for transport
missions, although he later reversed the decision.

In this febrile political era, few issues command stronger bipartisan support
than the need for fiscal responsibility. Barack Obama and Donald Trump
committed to curtail the US national debt on their respective roads to the
White House.

Donald Trump has accused Elon Musk of “losing his mind” as the dramatic
breakdown between the US’s most powerful person and the world’s richest person
escalated into a full-blown feud that could have seismic political and
economic consequences.

In a series of phone calls to US media on Friday morning, Trump snapped back
at Musk, after the tech mogul and Republican financier launched an
extraordinary social media attack on the president the day before, which ended
with him accusing Trump of being named in the so-called “Epstein files” –
documents related to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In Brussels’ corridors of power, quiet optimism is growing that the EU’s
hardball strategy to secure a US trade deal is working. While Britain quickly
moved to try to cushion the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs with a deal
agreed last month – and US-Chinese relations are a tit-for-tat situation – the
EU has taken a different stance. “We are positioning ourselves between
‘rollover UK’ and ‘retaliatory China’,” said a Brussels source.

The stakes are not just the £706bn in transatlantic trade between the EU and
US but the fallout from what diplomats and businesses say is a dangerous
assault on the global rules-based system that governs western democracy.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
