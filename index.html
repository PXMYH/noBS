Donald Trump is not making America feel great again.

Nine months into the second Trump administration, Americans are feeling pretty
crummy. More than half – 53% – believe the economy is worsening, according to
the latest survey conducted by Harris for the Guardian. That’s just slightly
better than the 58% who thought it was going downhill in late April, when
financial markets were still reeling from the president’s “liberation day”
tariffs. About 60% think the cost of living has gotten worse since the start
of the year; 47% say the job market is worse.

  * Analysis: Americans’ pessimism about the economy cuts across political lines

Nine months after Donald Trump took office, promising to reduce prices on “day
one”, a clear majority of Americans say their monthly costs have risen by
between $100 and $749, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the
Guardian.

The president has continued to insist that there is “virtually no inflation”.
“Prices are ‘WAY DOWN’ in the USA,” Trump wrote on social media in late
August.

The Trump administration has criticised China’s increased restrictions on rare
earth exports as a threat to global supply chains, and said it would seek to
tighten control over strategic sectors by taking more stakes in key companies
to counter Beijing.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told an event on Wednesday that China’s
dramatic new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets demonstrated the
need for the US to be self-sufficient in critical materials or rely more on
trusted allies.

planet-heating pollution than official figures show, a report has found.

The cars, which can run on electric batteries as well as combustion engines,
have been promoted by European carmakers as a way to cover long distances in a
single drive – unlike fully electric cars – while still reducing emissions.

            <p>Immigration lawyer Kim Xavier says stricter enforcement and delays are leaving
even legal immigrants in limbo and fear

Kim Xavier, a senior associate at CoveyLaw, an immigration law firm based in
New York, has spent much of the last year bracing herself for any Friday
announcements that might affect her clients.

            <p>Home to Magaluf, a major draw for boozed-up Britain, the island has become
emblematic of the most heated debate in travel

The swish seafront hotels and freshly planted palms on the gleaming promenade
might tempt any unwary holidaymaker to book in for Mallorca’s Calviá beach.
But step out the back door and the resort is still firmly, as it is better
known, Magaluf: boozed-up Britain in Spain, with cocktails by the pint.

Mallorca got most of the Balearics’ 3.5 million UK visitors last year: for
some residents, far too many. The island has become emblematic of the most
heated debate in travel: overtourism – and how to tackle it.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
