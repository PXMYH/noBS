            <p>Liz Uihlein sent staff email with cartoon of Trump saying ‘I hold the cards’
to which Xi says ‘the cards are made in China’

A top donor to Donald Trump and other Maga Republicans has privately mocked
the US president’s longtime position that he has an upper hand in trade
negotiations with China, in a sign that even some loyal supporters have been
uneasy with the White House strategy.

Liz Uihlein, the billionaire businesswoman who co-founded the office supply
company Uline with her husband, Richard, sent an email to her staff earlier
this year that contained a cartoon in which Trump can be seen playing cards
with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. In the cartoon, Trump claims: “I hold
the cards”, to which Xi responds: “The cards are made in China.”

            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The president’s claim that undermining his tariffs would ‘literally destroy’
the country gets the situation backwards

Just hours after an appeals court ruled that it was illegal for Donald Trump
to impose his unpopular across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries, he
posted a frantic, over-the-top rant that declared: “If allowed to stand, this
Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”

So here the president of the United States was asserting that if the courts
torpedoed his tariffs, then the US, the most powerful nation on earth, would
be destroyed, would “literally” be kaput. Trump seemed to suggest that court
rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of,
say, 100 hydrogen bombs.

The Mickey Mouse logo is all over Walt Disney’s headquarters in Burbank,

the studio on protest signs, including one labeling Disney executives as
“cowards” for suspending Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow in response to
pressure from the Trump administration.

Disney, which owns ABC, “indefinitely” suspended Kimmel’s show on Wednesday
night, following threatening remarks by Trump’s Federal Communications
Commission chair, Brendan Carr, about possible regulatory consequences for
comments Kimmel made about Trump and the Maga movement’s response to Charlie
Kirk’s killing.

Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, has announced plans to invest $5bn in

Intel – the latest extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate
America – Nvidia said it would team up with the firm to work on custom
datacenters that form the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI)
infrastructure, as well as personal computer products.

At a high-profile global summit held by China this month, there were strong
statements directed at the west’s “bullying” as well as renewed calls to
stabilise “global governance”. The meeting was the clearest indication yet
that China is vying to become a world superpower, aiming to marshal an anti-
western bloc. But the foundations of that position partly lie in Africa and
the Caribbean, where China has been building relationships for decades.

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
