Economic inequality has reached a staggering milestone in Silicon Valley: just
nine households hold 15% of the region’s wealth, according to new research
from San Jose State University. A mere 0.1% of residents hold 71% of the tech
hub’s wealth.

The findings come from the 2025 “Silicon Valley Pain Index”, a report
published by SJSU’s Human Rights Institute each year since 2020. The report
aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures
“pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”.

            <p>Newberry Springs was almost lost to the desert. But as America’s ‘mother road’
turns 100, locals see hope that the boom times could return

The tiny desert cafe, caught in a desolate middle between Los Angeles and Las

ambled in from the already blistering heat.

It was a Friday morning in June, sand swirling outside across the cracked
street and towards the Bagdad Cafe’s front door. In the same parking lot, a
1950s-era **** sign advertised a motel that no longer exists. In the distance,
only a few surviving businesses remained: a small community center, a veterans
organization and a longstanding roadhouse bar popular with locals. A few miles

Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that, as a result of the “tougher
environment” in the labor market, companies are “in control again” and are
warning applicants of “long hours and few boundaries”.

At the same time some industries are reporting worker shortages due to Donald
Trump’s immigration crackdown. And then there’s artificial intelligence, which
is about to devastate the jobs market – or is about to create new jobs.

deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the
immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
