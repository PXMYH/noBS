the sweltering heat.

Andrew Clarke knocks on the door of a ranch-style house. A dog barks
aggressively from inside. “Hi, my name’s Andrew. I’m an organizer with For Our

The Monongahela River winds through the tight Mon Valley south of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, creating a main artery in the nation’s industrial heart, where
the steel and coal industries have driven the region’s economy and shaped
political landscapes since the late 19th century.

In the weeks preceding the election, the region is once again playing an
outsize role in determining the nation’s political future. A controversial
Biden-Harris administration plan to kill Pittsburgh-based US Steel’s proposed
sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel is viewed in part as an election-year strategy to
shore up critical union support in a must-win swing state.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.
