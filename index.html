            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Company saw ‘strong start to the fiscal year’ according to its CEO, partly due
to higher profits from streaming business

Walt Disney sharply outperformed Wall Street’s quarterly earnings estimates on
Wednesday, with results buoyed by the strong holiday box office performance of
the animated sequel Moana 2 and higher profits at the company’s streaming
business.

The strength in entertainment helped offset a decline at Disney’s domestic
theme parks, which were impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida.
The parks-led Experiences group also incurred about $75m in expenses
associated with the December launch of the Disney Treasure cruise ship.

            <p>The 10% levy on goods imported from China closes a loophole used by Temu and
Shein. Experts say it may only tighten their grip on Americans

Vivi Armacost loves Temu. She uses the Chinese online marketplace to buy
crafting supplies for her purse-making hobby. “You can get purse detailing and
hardware for cents and pennies,” said Armacost, who is 24 and lives in New
York. She says it seems like “basically everything” in her apartment comes
from Temu.

Donald Trump’s 10% tariff on China-made goods sold to the US, which went into
effect early on Tuesday morning, might change her shopping habits. On top of
this, the US Postal Service briefly suspended deliveries of incoming parcels
from China and Hong Kong before they were later resumed.

The Google owner, Alphabet, has dropped its promise not to use artificial

The US technology company said on Tuesday, just before it reported lower-than-
forecast earnings, that it had updated its ethical guidelines around AI, and
they no longer referred to not pursuing technologies that could “cause or are

            <p>Underwhelming films and some disinterested buyers left many wondering what’s
next for the Utah-based festival

At the end of last year’s Sundance film festival there may have been some
concerns over the quality of films, but there was less worry over the quantity
of deals. As I wrote last year’s wrap, there had already been major big-money
sales – $10m for A Real Pain, $17m for It’s What’s Inside, $15m for My Old
Ass, $5m for Presence – some smaller ones – Thelma, Ghostlight, Ibelin,
Daughters, Skywalkers and Kneecap – and in the 48 hours after there were even
more – Dìdi to Focus and Will &amp; Harper to Netflix. Post-strikes it was a
reassuringly robust marketplace with gaps that needed to be filled but just a
year later, things are looking far less comforting.

There were even more questions over quality – I heard many a grumble in the
press line over a lack of breakouts – but even so, as of writing, there have
been only four deals confirmed, a worryingly dour result for what’s seen as
one of America’s most important markets. Films with sellable names like
Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch and Josh O’Connor and some
of the best-reviewed titles remain without distribution.

worked with him.

The claims against De Rothschild, two years after his death, come from several
women who said they felt unable to raise their concerns while he was still
alive, because of his position within the bank and the British establishment.
They spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity.

The British Virgin Islands (BVI) have been accused of a “shameful” attempt to
avoid a crackdown on financial crime, in a growing rift with the government
that threatens to escalate into a constitutional standoff.

MPs have written to the premier of the BVI, while the former development
minister Andrew Mitchell fired a broadside at the islands’ leadership, over
their proposals for a new register of who owns companies registered on the
islands.

  * US China tariffs – live updates
  * Business live – latest coverage

Donald Trump has fired the opening salvo of his trade war, imposing tariffs on
China on Tuesday that sparked instant retaliation from Beijing, amid fears for
the global economic repercussions.

Moments after US tariffs of 10% came into effect, China swiftly announced an
anti-trust investigation into Google. China’s finance ministry also announced
15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10% on crude oil, farm
equipment, large-displacement vehicles and pickup trucks from the US.

            <p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Trump delays
tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and China hits back with its own sanctions

  *  **China announces retaliatory tariffs moments after US levies take effect – live**

 **The 10% US tariff on all imports from China that kicked in today is not a
“game changer” for China’s growth forecasts, says European bank ABN Amro.**

They predict Beijing will respond with “a further stepping up of monetary
easing and fiscal support” – meaning interest rate cuts and more government
spending.

Although the first tariff implementation now seems to have come even earlier
than anticipated in our Global Outlook, _The Year of the Tariff,_ in our base
case we already anticipate a material (gradual) stepping up of US import
tariffs on China to an average effective tariff rate of 45% per Q2-2026.

While talks between Trump and Xi may potentially smoothen the risk of a
further escalation for now, Trump stated earlier this week that he sees the
10% tariffs as a first salvo, with tariffs on China potentially moving much
higher if no agreement is reached.

“Although we will continue to monitor trade policy closely, our base case
remains for the S&amp;P 500 to rise to 6,600 by year-end.

If implemented, tariffs on Canada and Mexico are unlikely to be sustained,
resilient US economic growth should support stocks, and we continue to believe
that AI presents a powerful structural tailwind for earnings and equity
markets.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
