work and the perfect job doesn’t exist

If you read the media, you’ll walk away with this impression: American
employees are fed up. They’re doing the “bare minimum” on Mondays,
“cushioning” their careers with side gigs, “rage applying” to vent their
frustrations and “coffee badging” to protest return-to-office policies.

US workers are “ghost quitting” (checking out without actually leaving their
jobs) and pretending to work when actually practicing “productivity theater”.
They’re taking paid time off without authorization in the form of “hush trips”
and “quiet vacations”. They’re suffering from “Zoom doom” and paying an
“emotional labor tax”. According to the latest polls, things are so bad that
they’re “quietly cracking”.

are fearful of further economic harm

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true
action has long been about 40 miles away from Hollywood, in a place where
high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprised of the Port
of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the
shipping world and an economic driver of California’s massive economy. The
busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world,
approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock,
moving billions of dollars’ worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts,
toys, clothes and furniture.

Hiring in the US slowed in April, according to official figures, with the
workforce adding 177,000 jobs as Donald Trump’s aggressive trade strategy
clouded the economic outlook.

As the White House pressed ahead with sweeping tariffs on overseas imports,
claiming this would revitalize the US economy, employers across the country
continued to add jobs at a steady pace.

still shows surge in planet-heating emissions

  * ‘A ruthless agenda’: charting 100 days of Trump’s onslaught on the environment

Donald Trump’s ambitions for the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more fossil
fuels have ironically been hampered by the economic chaos unleashed by his own
tariffs, but the US is still on track to increase oil and gas extraction,
causing a surge in planet-heating emissions, a new analysis shows.

The US was already the world’s leading oil and gas power, producing more of
the fossil fuels than any country in history during Joe Biden’s
administration. But Trump has sought to escalate this further, declaring an
“energy emergency” to open up more land and ocean for drilling and launching

Beijing is “evaluating” an offer from the US to engage in trade negotiations,
the Chinese government has said, a week after Donald Trump claimed talks were
already under way.

The EU’s strategy to secure its own supply of microchips is “deeply
disconnected from reality”, a damning report by the official European court of
auditors (ECA) has found.

The ECA reported that the bloc was “very unlikely” to meet its 2030 target of
supplying 20% of the world’s microchips at a time when global demand for
semiconductors is booming to meet the growing needs of defence, green tech and
artificial intelligence.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In Kansas, Panasonic and two community colleges scaled up training fast. But
jobs in the EV industry could be affected by Trump’s war on clean energy

In a Kansas City classroom, 20 students were learning how basic circuit boards
work. They fiddled with knobs, switches, levers and wires; if they got the
connections right, tiny light bulbs glowed.

The students, recruited for the opportunity by Panasonic, were participants in
an eight-week apprenticeship course that involved classes at the community
college and on-the-job training. When they’re done, they will be among the
first workers at the company’s new electric vehicle battery factory in nearby
De Soto, Kansas. The $4bn manufacturing plant – touted as the largest EV
battery factory in the world – is expected to open in early summer and
eventually employ roughly 4,000 people. Panasonic also paid for the students’
tuition, as well as the instructor’s salary.

Charlotte Young Bowens was 48 years old and 48 miles into a 50-mile
ultramarathon when suddenly she slumped to her knees and collapsed to the
ground, emotionally and physically exhausted. Curled into the fetal position,
she began crying harder than she had in years.

She wondered if she could finish. She rolled over on her back, looked up at
the sky and thought back to a dark period in her life, when she was clinically
depressed and not sure if she wanted to live. She no longer doubted. She knew
she could and would finish the race.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
