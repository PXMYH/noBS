  * Business live – latest updates

UBS has reported a $785m (£637m) quarterly loss, its first in nearly six
years, as the Swiss banking group counted the costs of rescuing its rival
Credit Suisse earlier this year.

The loss was nearly double the $444m that analysts had forecast, with UBS
saying it would have reported profits worth $844m in the third quarter had it
not been for the $2bn in expenses linked to the emergency takeover.

            <p>Consumer groups issue formal notice to European Commission over ‘greenwashing’
claims that bottles are ‘100% recyclable’ or ‘100% recycled’

Big drinks companies are misleading customers with claims that their plastic
water bottles are fully recycled or recyclable, according to consumer groups
who have issued a formal complaint to the European Commission.

The Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC) said claims that water
bottles from brands owned by Coca-Cola, Danone and Nestlé are “100%
recyclable” or “100% recycled” are misleading because recycling rates are far
lower in practice and bottles contain items that cannot be made from recycled
material. The consumer rights group, which represents national groups across
Europe, also said green imagery on bottles gave the “false idea” of
environmental neutrality.

WeWork’s rapid rise transformed it into one of the world’s most feted

after clinching that peak valuation, the business has filed for bankruptcy.

Dressed in the cloak of a technology company, WeWork turned out to be an
office rental business – one that was undone by problems of its own making and
finally by forces beyond its control.

  * UK politics live – latest updates

Beef, soy and palm oil products driving deforestation are still being imported
into the UK, despite government promises this practice would end, data has
revealed.

Campaigners have criticised the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) for failing to put practices in place to stop the import of
goods from areas with high deforestation rates. This is despite the government
having promised at the Cop26 climate conference in 2021 to implement the
rules.

In September, Chen Yiru, a Taiwanese influencer with nearly nine million fans

grinding 15 hours.

His followers were suitably wowed – until some started to question if such a
feat was humanly possible. The small print on the video stream confirmed their
suspicions: “For display purposes only, not a real person.”

But when Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven counts of wire fraud and

Netflix recently announced another price increase. It was just a couple of
bucks. No big deal, right? Wrong.

This price increase comes after another announced increase back in 2022 and
this time actually ranges from 16% to 20% depending on the service. Why is
Netflix doing this? Because it can. Netflix is no dummy. It knows that almost
all of its customers will stick with the service even though it’s costing a
little more. And they’re right. I love Netflix, so I’m going to pay.

The American buff goose. Amish deer tongue lettuce. The Nancy Hall sweet

fantastical-sounding ingredients in a database of vanishing foods called the
Ark of Taste, she set off on a journey across the United States to discover
more ingredients and traditions that had been abandoned in the annals of
history.

The endeavor was the latest installment of a storied career that has included
cooking 19th-century recipes at a living history museum and chronicling
American cuisine in her book Eight Flavors, which documents how foods like
black pepper and sriracha have helped reshape what Americans eat.

            <p>The United Auto Workers have scored a major victory. And it could be a sign of
more to come for workers – unless the Fed undermines them again

The United Auto Workers has scored a major victory. It’s still awaiting a vote
by union members, but it’s a big deal – a 25% wage increase over the four and
a half years of the contract, cost-of-living increases that will further
ratchet up hourly pay, the right to strike over plant closures and a shorter
time period for workers to reach top pay.

If the victory ripples across the auto industry and encourages wage increases
in other sectors, it will also be a victory for the American middle class.

Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at
the University of California at Berkeley

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
