            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Designer toys, cute trinkets and collectible accessories have been hot-ticket
items lately, thanks in large part to social media’s trend machine, with the
global key-chain pendant market now projected to be worth more than $28
billion by 2033, up from less than $18 billion in 2023, according to
researcher Spherical Insights. That&#39;s thanks in part to the rise of Labubus,
which have probably taken over your social media feed. Elsewhere in the retail
world, sock giant Bombas says it’s on track to make around $500 million in
revenue in 2025, an unspecified “double-digit increase” from the previous
year. And J.Crew&#39;s new CEO wants the brand to regain its former American
cultural clout. Bloomberg Businessweek Editor Anne Riley Moffat joins
Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)

huddle on Monday with Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi -- his most powerful
partners in resisting America on the world stage -- at a summit in the Chinese
port city of Tianjin. At one point, Xi held the hand of his Indian
counterpart, as the three men laughed casually, a striking scene given just
months earlier New Delhi and Beijing were seen as rivals. The Asia Society

Gold rose above $3,500 (£2,614) an ounce, surpassing its April peak. It has

The tide has turned. The great migration – when the shift to remote work
prompted people to quit their jobs in droves – is officially over. Now comes

2025. They gave reasons like having “positive company culture” and “feeling
professionally fulfilled” or “being well compensated” at their current job.
But there’s also a fourth reason why so many are staying put: the job market
isn’t great and people are worried.

            <p>The growing threat of fires has shaken the Napa valley wine industry, as fears
of smoke-spoiled grapes and soaring insurance rates put vintners on edge

Elton Slone and his colleagues at the Robert Craig Winery in Napa valley had
gathered for their annual pre-harvest company party last week – complete with
copper pot carnitas and grape tacos – when one of his co-workers noticed an
alert on her phone. The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles
(16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on
Howell Mountain.

Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blaze that damaged numerous wineries and
spoiled a year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel
remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the
week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for
the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property
to control the larger fire.

Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the
cockpit have been put on ice after a report for the European regulator
suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”
commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) found that despite

Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-

US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number
of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these
actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like,
or the power to tax”, the court said in the 7-4 ruling.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
