            <p>Prices are starting to level out, with some toys, electronics and apparel

Some good news for the holiday season: shopping for gifts this year will
probably be a bit cheaper than last year. The bad news? Consumers just aren’t
feeling the holiday cheer – and with good reason.

After over a year of high inflation, prices in the US are starting to level
out, with drops in prices of some goods. The cost of a dozen eggs went from an
average of $4.83 down to an average of $2.07 this October. Gas prices
surpassed $5 a gallon in summer 2022, and are now down to a national average
of $3.30.

Binance is guilty. The world’s largest crypto exchange admitted to a range of
violations in a massive US court action, including unlicensed money
transmitting, sanctions violations and anti-money laundering (AML) violations.
Its founder, Changpeng Zhao, near-universally known as CZ, personally pled
guilty to his failure to maintain money-laundering controls.

The failures “allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child
abusers through its platform”, the US secretary of the treasury, Janet Yellen,
said. From our story:

As part of a guilty plea, Zhao agreed to pay a $50m fine and would be barred
from any involvement in the business. Binance too agreed to plead guilty,
accept the appointment of a monitor and pay a criminal fine of nearly $1.81bn
as well as a $2.51bn order of forfeiture to settle three criminal charges.

Zhao wrote in a tweet: “Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. … I made
mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for
Binance, and for myself … I can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup
again.”

On March 8, 2022, one of these video-conference meetings was scheduled. Mr
Moniruzzaman, now employed by Nvidia, attended the video-conference call… and
shared his computer screen during the call. When he minimized the PowerPoint
presentation he had been sharing, however, he revealed one of Valeo’s verbatim
source code files open on his computer. So brazen was Mr Moniruzzaman’s theft,
the file path on his screen still read “ValeoDocs.” Valeo participants on the
video-conference call immediately recognized the source code and took a
screenshot before Mr Moniruzzaman was alerted of his error. By then it was too
late to cover his tracks.

The United States is poised to extract more oil and gas than ever before in

decade ago, will be extracted in 2023.

The industry association, the Digital Industry Group (Digi), announced on
Monday that its disinformation and misinformation independent complaints
subcommittee found X had “committed a serious breach of the code and has

            <p>Office for Budget Responsibility says UK entry into the Indo-Pacific agreement
will add just 0.04% to GDP in the long run

The UK’s flagship trans-Pacific trade deal, which was presented as a
cornerstone of post-Brexit “global Britain”, will deliver even less benefit to
the economy than the tiny uplift that was previously predicted, according to
the Office for Budget Responsibility.

In a report accompanying last week’s autumn statement, the OBR said the UK’s
entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP) would add just 0.04% to GDP in the “long run”, which it
defines as after 15 years of membership.

Lachlan Murdoch has been chairman of News Corporation and Fox Corporation, the
parent company of Fox News, for more than a week now after his father Rupert
finally officially handed the reins to him.

Beyond the titular changes, how much of a transition is in fact being made is
open to question. “I hope to continue an active role in the company,” the
elder Murdoch, 92, remarked during the company’s most recent annual
shareholders meeting.

            <p>Challenging each other to cage fights, building apocalypse bunkers – the
behaviour of today’s mega-moguls is becoming increasingly outlandish and
imperial

Even their downfalls are spectacular. Like a latter-day Icarus flying too
close to the sun, disgraced crypto-god Sam Bankman-Fried crashed and burned
this month, recasting Michael Lewis’s exuberant biography of the convicted
fraudster – Going Infinite – into the story of a supervillain. Even his
potential sentence of up to 115 years in prison seems more suitable for a
larger-than-life comic book character – the Joker being carted off to Arkham
Asylum – than a nerdy, crooked currency trader.

But that’s the way this generation of tech billionaires rolls. The Elon Musk
we meet in Walter Isaacson’s biography posts selfies of himself as Marvel
comic character Doctor Strange – the “Sorcerer Supreme” who protects the Earth
against magical threats. Musk is so fascinated with figures such as Iron Man
that he gave a tour of the SpaceX factory to the actor who plays him, Robert
Downey Jr, and the film’s director, Jon Favreau. As if believing he really has
acquired these characters’ martial arts prowess, in June Musk challenged
fellow übermensch Mark Zuckerberg to “a cage match” after Zuck launched an app
to compete with the floundering Twitter. Musk and Zuck exchanged taunts in the
style of superheroes or perhaps professional wrestlers. “I’m up for a cage
match if he is,” tweeted Musk. “Send Me Location,” responded Zuck from
Instagram’s Threads.

Public trust in some of the world’s most repressive governments is soaring,
according to Edelman, the world’s largest public relations firm, whose
flagship “trust barometer” has created its reputation as an authority on
global trust. For years, Edelman has reported that citizens of authoritarian
countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and
China, tend to trust their governments more than people living in democracies
do.

But Edelman has been less forthcoming about the fact that some of these same
authoritarian governments have also been its clients. Edelman’s work for one
such client – the government of the UAE – will be front and center when world
leaders convene in Dubai later this month for the UN’s Cop28 climate summit.

            <p>The surprise sacking of the AI venture’s CEO was followed by a near mutiny at
the company and his reinstatement

OpenAI’s messy firing and rehiring of its powerful chief executive this week

Changpeng Zhao, founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange,
Binance, warned last year that it was difficult to prevent illegal activity in
the industry that he dominated. “[If] somebody wants to violate the law, the

to breaking US anti-money-laundering legislation. He will pay a $50m fine and
faces a possible prison term, while Binance has agreed to pay a $4.3bn

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>For well over a decade, “interest-earning savings account” was almost an
oxymoron -- interest rates offered to depositors were near zero almost
everywhere. Then the US Federal Reserve started rapidly increasing rates in
early 2022 to fight inflation. US banks raised their deposit rates a little;
money market funds (MMFs) raised theirs by much more. What followed was a wave
of more than $1 trillion in bank deposit withdrawals, perhaps the biggest,
fastest outflow ever, while MMF assets surged by $

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
