            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>European equities dropped, tracking Asian shares lower, as US President Donald
Trump’s latest pronouncements on trade tariffs drained investor appetite for
riskier assets. Bitcoin plunged, extending declines from its January peak to
over 25%. Regardless of how Friday turns out, February has been a terrible
month for Tesla, with the stock dropping 14 of the 19 trading days in the
month, including the past six straight. Trump said 25% tariffs on Canada and
Mexico would come into force from March 4, while Chinese imports would face a
further 10% levy. Economists say tariffs may hurt US growth, worsen inflation
and possibly spark recessions in Mexico and Canada. The Opening Trade has

ETFs for equities make a lot of sense, he sees questionable value in ETFs in
the credit market, especially with a lack of liquidity in the underlying

In late January, Lauren Bedson did what many would likely find unthinkable:
she cancelled her Amazon Prime membership. The catalyst was Donald Trump’s
inauguration. Many more Americans are planning to make similar decisions this
Friday.

Bedson made her move after seeing photos of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder,

Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai, just rows behind Trump at his
inauguration.

As Ukrainians prepare to enter their fourth year dealing with the harsh daily
realities of life during conflict with Russia, few will be musing on the
comparative economic health of the warring nations. However, inflation figures
released either side of the border showed the continued toll the conflict has

Firms at the heart of the US’s sports betting boom have been accused of
encouraging gamblers to chase losses by rewarding high spenders with betting
credits, bonuses, gifts and even trips.

In letters obtained by the Guardian, gambling giants told a prominent US
senator last year that their controversial VIP programs were “not designed” to
prompt frequent bettors to bet more. But problem gambling advocates are
skeptical.

years before the Eaton fire destroyed it

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the

watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner,
was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures
included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a
threadbare T-shirt from Occidental College, the school where Bruce and Nancy
first met – and where he would go on to work for more than 35 years.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
