an example of an innovation ecosystem that is developing ways to fund research
as the federal government steps back. Plus, a test of Argentine President
Javier Milei’s austerity measures is coming. After suffering a setback in a
crucial election, the future of Milei’s vision to reform Argentina’s economy
is in question. Later, Tom Brady and US investors are betting on Birmingham,
not London, to fuel the UK’s next big economic growth story. (Source:

            <p>As more money is invested into the US stock market, and indexes hit record
levels, a contradictory force is playing out as well: fewer companies are
choosing to go public. Bryce Tingle, the N. Murray Edwards Chair in Business

the perils that come with a wide swath of investors increasingly relying on
the same group of select firms to perform well. Professor Tingle discusses
what he sees as declining innovation and rising economic concentration with
Carol Massar, Tim Stenovec and Bloomberg Intelligence Global Equity Strategist
Gillian Wolff on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>US presidents have long had adversarial relationships with the media -- but no
American head of state has taken that battle to the extremes that Donald Trump
has. By using, or threatening to use, the courts and his administration’s
authority, Trump has forced a series of major concessions from the world’s
largest outlets. Walt Disney Co. stunned the industry Wednesday when ABC put
Jimmy Kimmel’s show on indefinite hiatus, after a Sept. 15 monologue in which
the popular comedian riffed on how Trump and his supporters reacted to the
assassination of Republican activist Charlie Kirk. The segment had drawn a
public rebuke earlier from Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission. Bloomberg News Media Reporter Hannah Miller joins
Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss, with hosts Carol Massar and Tim
Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)

A top donor to Donald Trump and other Maga Republicans has privately mocked
the US president’s longtime position that he has an upper hand in trade
negotiations with China, in a sign that even some loyal supporters have been
uneasy with the White House strategy.

Liz Uihlein, the billionaire businesswoman who co-founded the office supply
company Uline with her husband, Richard, sent an email to her staff earlier
this year that contained a cartoon in which Trump can be seen playing cards
with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. In the cartoon, Trump claims: “I hold
the cards”, to which Xi responds: “The cards are made in China.”

In the aftermath of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination,
dozens across the United States have been fired, suspended or disciplined over
social media posts about Kirk and his death, as employers and public officials
crack down on remarks they deem “inappropriate”.

After Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on 10 September while speaking at Utah
Valley University, members of the Trump administration called on the public to
expose anyone appearing to be “celebrating” his killing.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

            <p>The president’s claim that undermining his tariffs would ‘literally destroy’
the country gets the situation backwards

Just hours after an appeals court ruled that it was illegal for Donald Trump
to impose his unpopular across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries, he
posted a frantic, over-the-top rant that declared: “If allowed to stand, this
Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”

So here the president of the United States was asserting that if the courts
torpedoed his tariffs, then the US, the most powerful nation on earth, would
be destroyed, would “literally” be kaput. Trump seemed to suggest that court
rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of,
say, 100 hydrogen bombs.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus

A giant banner featuring a serious-looking Donald Trump now hangs down the

of nearly three floors, the poster reads: “American Workers FIRST.”

“Mr President, I invite you see your big beautiful face on a banner in front
of the Department of Labor because you are really the transformational
president of the American worker,” the labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeReme,
said last month at a cabinet meeting with the president.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
