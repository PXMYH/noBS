            <p>Forget productivity! Author and consultant Bree Groff believes the true sign
of a successful workplace is how much fun the employees are having. Is this
the answer to post-Covid burnout and disengagement?

Who would say work was fun? Your job might be rewarding (some of the time).
You may get on with your colleagues (some of them). But _fun_? It seems
simultaneously too grand an ambition and too small.

After the work-centric “hustle culture” of the 2010s, then the backlash and
widespread burnout brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the general feeling
around work right now could be described as ambivalent at best. At worst, it’s
openly combative, as evinced by frequent references to the “battle” over
working from home. Managers want employees back in the office; employees want
flexibility, and to limit work’s impact on their lives.

On the campaign trail, Donald Trump pledged to use tariffs to revitalise
American industry, bringing jobs home and helping to make America great again.
But more than six months into his administration, experts say the president’s
trade war is increasingly being wielded as a political cudgel, in lieu of more
traditional forms of diplomacy.

The president’s current target, India, has been unable to reach a trade
agreement, and Trump appears ready to follow through with his threat to impose
a further 25% tariff on Delhi – bringing the total to 50% – the joint highest
levy on any country, along with Brazil.

Three leading US economists are urging their peers around the world to push

In what amounts to a call to action to economists, the trio say rollback of
environmental regulations is “inconsistent or antithetical” to fundamental
principles of economics over how to allocate the world’s limited resources for
the greatest possible value to society.

Withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

Eliminating consideration in federal policy of the well-established effects of
climate breakdown on public welfare.

Executive orders to “drill baby drill” giving priority to fossil fuel energy
production.

Ending research funding on environment and climate and the collection of
environmental data.

Reducing investments and regulations designed to tackle lead and forever
chemicals in drinking water.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
