            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>History suggests that bullying the Fed for political gain can have serious
consequences for the rest of us

One of the more critical lessons economists gleaned from the Nixon
administration is about the exorbitant cost of allowing politicians to mess
with the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump also learned an important lesson from
Richard Nixon – a very different one.

Nixon had blamed the Fed for his loss in his first bid for the presidency in
1960. By keeping rates high, he believed, it caused a recession that led
voters to punish the then vice-president. In 1972, he would not let that
happen again.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>My generation is struggling for stability in a system that no longer feels fit
for purpose. It’s time to take that seriously

For gen Z Americans, it’s hard to remember a version of the economy not
defined by crisis. We finished our education online as Covid devastated the
world, only to graduate into high costs of living, stagnant wages and now AI’s
threat to entry-level jobs. We’ve come of age in a system that no longer feels
fit for purpose.

The result is a generation that’s lost faith in the traditional markers of
stability. What once defined a secure life – home, family and comfortable
retirement – feels out of reach. “A pension is out of the question,” one
friend told me. “So staying in the same job no longer makes sense.” She’s not
alone: jobseekers’ confidence in keeping or finding work dropped sharply this
spring, with a survey in June suggesting nearly 60% of graduates were still
looking for their first jobs.

Alice Lassman is a policy expert with a focus on the global economy and
gender. Her forthcoming book explores how AI’s influence on gender and
emotions are reshaping economic life

Elon Musk, the multibillionaire and self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”,

Netflix subscriptions in protest of what he claims is the company’s “woke
bias” and inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters.

Musk, the richest person in the world with a net worth of approximately
$500bn, has repeatedly encouraged his 227 million followers on X, the platform
he controls, to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. In the past three days
alone, he has posted or reposted calls to cancel Netflix for its content at
least 26 times.

Zink &amp; Sons has made bespoke suits on Sydney’s Oxford Street for 130 years.
For most of that time, the family-owned men’s tailoring business has resided
at number 56, halfway between Hyde Park and the street’s LGBTQI heart at
Taylor Square. Today its director, Daniel Jones, is looking for a new base
after a rent increase he says is unaffordable.

His shop is located in a development project that has been almost six years in
the making. Oxford and Foley, a commercial strip of renovated heritage
buildings, has been touted as key to revitalising the storied and colourful
street, bringing new retail, hospitality and creative spaces, upmarket tenants
and an injection of fresh energy. Three weeks ago, Golf Wang, the much-hyped
fashion store of the musician Tyler, The Creator, was the first shop to open
in the refurbished section of the commercial strip.

Night train services linking Paris, Berlin and Vienna are to end from mid-

Austrian national rail operator has said, in a blow to sleeper travel on

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
