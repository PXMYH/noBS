International Energy Agency (IEA) has previously stated. Breaching this
warming threshold, agreed to by governments in the Paris climate agreement,

help, and hope

Each man enters the room, one by one, escaping the dark night outside. Before
long some two dozen are sitting in a horseshoe. They hail from different
worlds and different generations, but have been united by the same problem.

For decades, Gamblers Anonymous (GA) has offered compulsive gamblers a place
to share their stories, and listen to others, in the hope of turning their
lives around. Veterans of the 12-step program say it is now experiencing a
sharp rise in interest from troubled young addicts.

Turkey’s central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates to 50% on Thursday,
citing a deteriorating inflation outlook and pledging to tighten further if it
looks like inflation is significantly and persistently worsening.

The hawkish move came 10 days before local elections and was seen by analysts

Queensland renter Anne Dirks has spent three months struggling to find a new
home.

Brisbane last month surpassed Melbourne as Australia’s third-most expensive
city, now just behind Canberra and Sydney. She said it has been a hard search,
and she has been turned back several times.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
