Donald Trump proclaimed he was for “all the forgotten men and women”, in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention. His vice-presidential pick JD
Vance consistently portrays himself as a pro-worker populist. But an analysis
of the labor chapter of Project 2025 – an ambitious rightwing plan to guide
the next Republican presidency – found it has little to offer them.

Project 2025’s labor section proposes hardly anything to improve workers’
wages and working conditions. It is, however, chock full of recommendations
that would boost corporate profits, undercut labor unions and advance the
rightwing culture war.

A mysterious person leaving miniature ducks around the office. An employee who

that goes to a worker’s head. A throwback to paperwork when the computers go
down. Or my favorite: a visit to another showroom in “disguise” to check out
the competition.

It’s The Dealership, a weekly TikTok series brought to you by Mohawk
Chevrolet. It’s filmed just like the popular TV show The Office. And it’s a
hit, gaining close to 6m views in just the past couple of months. Mohawk may
be selling Chevrolets. But its marketing team is producing a Ferrari.

Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash soar at his

stake in Apple, even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating
profit.

Berkshire sold about 390m Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115m
shares from January to March, as Apple’s stock price rose 23%. It still owned
about 400m shares worth $84.2bn as of 30 June.

Jenny Björklund was out on an island in Finland’s Åland archipelago with a
friend when they saw a boat approaching across the Baltic Sea. She assured her
friend, who was visiting from Gothenburg in Sweden, that they would be left
alone.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come here because we are here. This is our island,”
Björklund, a co-owner of a restaurant and distillery on the archipelago, says

            <p>As demand for the tin ore cassiterite soars, special forces units of Brazil’s
Ibama environment agency must play a cat and mouse game with the thousands of
illegal miners pouring into Yanomami reserves

In the back yard of the federal police headquarters in Roraima, the

other items seized during a crackdown on illegal mining in this Amazon state –
including a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter painted in the colours of the Brazilian
flag – cassiterite has become so sought-after that it is nicknamed “black

of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
