            <p>Cava Group has cut its full year sales growth targets after foot traffic
stalled in the third quarter, adding to a growing trend of financially
squeezed consumers foregoing fast casual restaurants. However, despite
consumers feeling more pressure, Cava CFO Tricia Tolivar believes the chain is
becoming &#39;more accessible for the lower income consumer,&#39; driving an increase
in sales in that area. She joined Carol Massar, Tim Stenovec, and Nina
Trentmann on &#39;Bloomberg Businessweek Daily&#39; to discuss the company&#39;s growth

            <p>Nimble, open-minded outfits such as Nina Protocol, Cantilever and Subvert are
looking to bring more money to artists, and a richer experience for listeners

The noise around Spotify this year has been louder than ever, from Liz Pelly’s
book Mood Machine – a biting indictment of the company and its alleged
practices, described as “error-riddled theories” by Spotify itself – to a slew
of indie artists leaving the platform due to political and ethical reasons.
There was even a recent music forum in California called Death to Spotify.

So the timing is fortuitous for a growing number of independent streaming and
music community platforms, such as Nina Protocol, Coda, Subvert, Lissen,
Vocana, and just last week a new one launched in the UK: Cantilever. “More
people are definitely looking for alternatives,” says Nina Protocol’s chief
executive Mike Pollard. “We strongly believe the future of music is
independent.”

            <p>The dirt-cheap clothing company has opened its first permanent store in Paris
– and politicians and workers have united against it

Paris is the fashion capital of the world – a paradise of couture and
craftsmanship stretching back centuries. The city’s very name connotes luxury
and glamour. But last Wednesday, 5 November, a sprawling Shein outlet opened
on the sixth floor of the BHV Marais, the historic department store directly
across from Paris’s city hall. It’s the Singapore-based ultra-fast-fashion
store’s first permanent bricks and mortar retail space, and the first of
several permanent outposts Shein plans to open in France in the near future.
Many Parisians aren’t happy about it.

Shein – launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China – is the reprehensible
paragon of the ultra-fast-fashion industry. The company sells clothing (and
home goods, toys, stationery, cookware, blankets, pet supplies and more) at an
unfathomable scale: today’s “new in” page alone lists more than 1,300 items,
from shiny gold shirts in its “Manfinity Mode” category, to plunging, plus-
size swimsuits under the sub-brand “Slaysola”. Nearly everything on the site
is made of plastic, designed for single-use disposability, and it’s all
shockingly, disturbingly cheap.

  * US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump has, for years, used legal threats and lawsuits to pressure news
companies who put out coverage he does not like. After his return to power, a
string of US broadcasters and tech firms have paid tens of millions of dollars
to settle such cases.

The president has now gone global with this campaign, crossing the pond to
threaten the BBC with a $1bn lawsuit over an episode of the Panorama
documentary program that aired more than a year ago.

As interventions go it was pretty audacious. The Dutch government decision at

almost brought the entire European car industry to a halt.

Tensions between Europe and China de-escalated over the weekend as Beijing
confirmed it would ease restrictions on automotive chip supplies to the EU,
prompting sighs of relief in car factories around the world.

Governments failing to shift to a low-carbon economy will be blamed for famine

the UN’s climate chief warned on Monday at the start of the Cop30 climate
talks.

Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on
climate change, addressed the gathering of ministers and high-ranking
officials from nearly 200 countries, in a stark portrayal of the price of
failure on the climate crisis.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
