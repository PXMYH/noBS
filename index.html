            <p>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Alberto Musalem joins Bloomberg
Open Interest to discuss the state of the US economy and labor market as the
central bank contends with missing data amid the government shutdown. Musalem
also discusses the rate path forward, saying it&#39;s &#34;very important&#34; for the Fed
to move forward &#34;with caution,&#34; adding there is &#34;limited room&#34; to cut rates
further. Musalem also acknowledged concern over asset valuations and pointed
to the Fed’s recent semi-annual report on financial stability. “It’s not our
job to opine on particular valuations of markets, but if you look at that
report, house prices seem elevated relative to historical standards, stock
prices seem elevated, and to me it’s just the flip side of accommodative
financial conditions,” Musalem said. He speaks with Bloomberg TV International
Economics &amp; Policy Correspondent Michael McKee on Bloomberg&#39;s Open Interest.

Ikea tables with metal nuts and bolts and German combine harvesters.

More than 5,000 fossil fuel lobbyists were given access to the UN climate
summits over the past four years, a period marked by a rise in catastrophic

But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
