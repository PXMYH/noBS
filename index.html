Many travellers to Europe will see changes in border security from Sunday with

the labor force

The government shutdown may have prevented the publication of September’s job
report, but we can be reasonably confident that when the numbers are known,
they will further underscore the Trump administration’s policy incoherence and
remind us of all of the damage he is prepared to inflict on the American
economy.

The president will most likely be apoplectic over data confirming that the
economy is generating very few new jobs (the payroll processor ADP estimated a
loss of 32,000 private sector jobs in September). Trump fired the head of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs numbers, after a
lackluster report published in August.

At the Purfeerst farm in southern Minnesota, the soybean harvest just wrapped
up for the season. The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of
soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece.

This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods
depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck
in the middle of a trade war between the US and China, the biggest purchaser
of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs.

waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish
stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell
some of the day’s catch.

This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats
have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066.

            <p>US president’s threat to impose 92% tariffs targeting major manufacturers puts
family-run firms in the line of fire as well

“It’s a real pity,” laments Antonio Rummo of Donald Trump’s latest target in
his ever-evolving tariff war: Italian pasta. Rummo is the sixth-generation
grandson of the founder of Pasta Rummo, who opened a wheat mill in Benevento
in southern Italy in 1846, using the family’s three horses to lug grain from
the surrounding Campania region and Puglia to produce fresh pasta.

“Demand for premium pasta in the US has been growing,” says Rummo. Appreciated
by consumers for a traditional processing method that guarantees it will cook
to _al dente_ perfection, sales of Pasta Rummo have been thriving.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
