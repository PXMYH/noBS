Last spring, Carmelo Mendez was pruning peach trees in Colorado on a temporary

him.

Mendez is one of the more than 300,000 foreign agricultural workers who comes
to the US every year on an H-2A visa, which allows him to temporarily work
plowing fields, pruning trees and harvesting crops in states from Washington
to Georgia, Florida to New York, Texas to California. But as federal

about their future.

Elon Musk has publicly criticised Donald Trump’s tax bill, saying the US

spearheaded, in comments likely to widen a rift between the two men.

The remarks by the billionaire businessman were made to CBS as part of a

Americans’ views of the economy improved in May after five straight months of

Covid-19 pandemic, largely driven by anxiety over the impact of Donald Trump’s
tariffs.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose
12.3 points in May to 98, up from April’s 85.7, its lowest reading since May
2020.

 **Ouch! Germany’s economy is on track for its worst performance in post-war
history, a new report shows.**

The **German** **Chamber** **of** **Commerce** **and** **Industry** ( **DIHK**
) predicted this morning that Europe’s largest economy will contract by 0.3%

“A mood of cautious relief is spreading after the long weekend, amid hopes for
more fruitful trade negotiations between the United States and its global

Footsie in striking distance of the record high reached in February. More

hopes that more scores can be etched on the doors of trade talks.

“US futures point to a higher open on indices, as optimism spreads after the
holiday break. Trump once again has pressed the pause button, this time on

            <p>Wind turbines have become a financial lifeline in rural areas, but state
legislators are now targeting them

As a Republican state lawmaker for 16 years, a Texas rancher and a staunch
supporter of Donald Trump, John Davis’s conservative credentials are
impeccable. But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an
increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US –
clean energy development.

Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling
hill country near Menard, west of Austin, and has seen the income provide
opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is
one of the poorest counties in Texas.

Donald Trump wants to “dictate” policies like those of far-right regimes in
the 1930s, a leading billionaire investor has warned.

Ray Dalio writes in a new book that the US president is acting like a chief
executive without a board as he seeks to expand executive power even more

Drastic cuts at a federal workplace safety research agency increase the risk

public health emergencies, fired employees warn.

The Trump administration ordered widespread layoffs at the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, inside the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, when it issued a “reduction in force” notice to some 85% of the
agency’s 1,100 workers employees on 1 April.

The owners of the multibillion-pound James Bond franchise have requested more

after a legal challenge to their trademark rights across a range of goods and
services.

In February, the Guardian revealed that a Dubai-based property developer had
filed claims in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various
protections had lapsed around James Bond’s intellectual property, including
his name, his 007 assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Instead of cutting taxes on the richest Americans – who hold much of the
country’s debt – simply raise them

On Friday, the credit rating of the United States was downgraded. Moody’s, the
ratings firm, announced that the government’s rising debt levels would grow
further if the Trump Republican package of new tax cuts were enacted. This
makes lending to the US riskier.

Moody’s is the third of the three major credit-rating agencies to downgrade
the credit rating of the United States.

They’ll pay even _more_ interest on the growing debt – to the super-rich.

They’ll pay higher interest rates on all other long-term debt. (As higher
rates on treasury bonds waft through the economy, they raise borrowing costs
on everything from mortgages to auto loans.)

The debt crisis will give Republicans even more excuse to do what they’re
always wanting to do: slash safety nets. So many Americans could lose benefits
they rely on, such as Medicaid and food stamps.

emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a Guardian US
columnist. His newsletter is at robertreich.substack.com

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
