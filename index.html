            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The controversial $8bn deal was finalized this week and while details are
scarce, the future is set to look very different for one of the biggest
Hollywood studios

The merger between Paramount and Skydance has finally been completed, with
various roadblocks (including Stephen Colbert, apparently, as well as the

called Paramount, A Skydance Corporation.

It’s an appropriately franchise-y moniker for a merger between a major
Hollywood studio and a company that made its bones as a constant financer of
some of its biggest movie series. This ends (for now) years of speculation
over what might be done with Paramount, a global conglomerate that was
nonetheless considered on less sure footing than its fellow remaining big five
studios, Disney, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. (Well, maybe not the
recently embattled Warner Bros, though they seem to have gotten a major
reprieve with their killer 2025 slate) Skydance honcho David Ellison is the

executive Dana Goldberg and former Sony executive Josh Greenstein.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
