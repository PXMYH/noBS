houses Blackstone Inc., Rudin Management, the National Football League and

Shane Tamura from Nevada. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a 90-day
extension of a trade truce with China was a likely outcome with negotiations

deal will bring a sense of stability back to transatlantic relations. The euro
fell to a five-week low of $1.1527 on Tuesday, having fallen about 1.8% since
the trade deal was announced. That’s after the common currency had surged to a
near three-year high last week on the prospect of an agreement with the US.

Donald Trump said reports of him seeking a summit with China’s Xi Jinping are
“not correct”. Today&#39;s guests: Ursula Marchioni, BlackRock EMEA Head of

Boeing Co expects more than 3,200 union workers at three St Louis-area plants
that produce US fighter jets to strike after they rejected a proposed contract
on Sunday that included a 20% wage increase over four years.

The International Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said the vote by

existing contract was to expire at 11.59pm central time on Sunday, but the
union said a “cooling off” period would keep a strike from beginning for
another week, until 4 August.
