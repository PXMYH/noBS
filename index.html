contracts gained 1.4%. Late Monday, a Washington judge has ruled that Google
illegally monopolized the search market through exclusive deals. This is a win
on the government&#39;s side in its first major antitrust case against a tech

smartphones and web browsers effectively blocked any other competitor from
succeeding in the market. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>Though tiny compared with rivals, English wine trade is thriving as climate
crisis fuels flood of new capital from investors

The largest English vineyards increased their revenues by 15% last year, as
wine investors respond to the climate crisis by planting more vines.

While the UK still languishes well down the list of the largest wine-producing
nations, below countries such as Uzbekistan and Tunisia, the industry’s output
has soared in recent years, rising by 77% last year to 161,960 hectolitres,
equivalent to 21.6m bottles.

Donald Trump proclaimed he was for “all the forgotten men and women”, in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention. His vice-presidential pick JD
Vance consistently portrays himself as a pro-worker populist. But an analysis
of the labor chapter of Project 2025 – an ambitious rightwing plan to guide
the next Republican presidency – found it has little to offer them.

Project 2025’s labor section proposes hardly anything to improve workers’
wages and working conditions. It is, however, chock full of recommendations
that would boost corporate profits, undercut labor unions and advance the
rightwing culture war.

Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash soar at his
Berkshire Hathaway firm to nearly $277bn and selling a large chunk of its
stake in Apple, even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating
profit.

Berkshire sold about 390m Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115m
shares from January to March, as Apple’s stock price rose 23%. It still owned
about 400m shares worth $84.2bn as of 30 June.

After years of global growth, the luxury industry is facing a new foe:
“underconsumption”. On TikTok, #underconsumptioncore emerges as a trending
topic, as the next generation of potential shoppers swap tips on how to look
good while buying and spending less. The entire sector is struggling as
consumers wince at luxury prices, and are left bemused by the rapid turnaround
of designers.

Last week, shares in Kering, owner of luxury labels including Gucci,
Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, hit a seven-year low
after reporting that operating income in the second half of the year would be
down 30% after a 42% drop in the first half.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
