The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will apply some credit card
consumer protection rules to buy now, pay later (BNPL) lenders, the agency
said on Wednesday, in an effort to impose more oversight on the fast-growing
sector.

BNPL providers such as Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay partner with retailers to
finance customer purchases, which shoppers repay in installments. The sector
has become a major source of credit, but lacks a federal oversight framework.

The United States-based investment fund Oaktree Capital Management said on
Wednesday it has become the new owner of Serie A champions Inter after a
missed $428m (£336m) payment from the club’s Chinese holding company, Suning.

Granted in 2021 to the Luxembourg-based vehicle through which the Chinese
conglomerate Suning controlled Inter, the loan was guaranteed by the firm’s
stake in the club. Under the scheme, Oaktree had the right to take control of
the club in the event of a default.

Citigroup has been fined £61.6m by financial regulators after its internal
systems failed to prevent a fat-fingered banker causing a flash crash by
erroneously placing more than £1bn of orders.

The trader had intended to sell equities to the value of $58m (£46m) on 2 May
2022. However, the banker made an inputting error while entering the
transaction into Citigroup’s order management system, so a giant equities
basket of $444bn was created – and $1.4bn was then sold into the market.

 _Less than six months before the US presidential election on 5 November_ _,
anxiety over the economy looms large. While official figures show a
significant recovery since the pandemic, many Americans aren’t buying it. As
election day approaches,_ _the Guardian is dispatching reporters to key swing
counties to gauge how they are feeling_ – _and how they might vote._

Rows of pecan and peach trees frame the scenery throughout Peach county,
Georgia, a rural area of central Georgia, about 100 miles south of Atlanta. A
field of yellow school buses pack a lot on the way into Fort Valley, the
county’s seat, where the buses used across the US are manufactured.

Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic
recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a
Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found
persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer.

The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy,
including:

55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a
recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product
(GDP), has been growing.

49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the
index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year.

49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment
rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low.

He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
