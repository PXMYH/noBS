            <p>Ursula von der Leyen says tariffs a ‘major blow’ to world economy, as US
dollar falls to six month low after US President Trump’s ‘liberation day’

  * Full report: Trump announces sweeping new tariffs
  * Analysis: Trump’s tariffs likely to raise prices and cause chaos
  * What are tariffs and why do they matter?

The new US tariffs “will only create losers” with US consumers particularly
hard hit, the **German Automotive Industry Association (VDA)** , has said in a
statement, calling on the EU “to act together and with the necessary force,
while continuing to signal its willingness to negotiate.”

The body, which represents the powerful German auto industry, said the tariffs
marked

the United States’ departure from the rules-based global trade order – and
thus a departure from the foundation for global value creation and
corresponding growth and prosperity in many regions of the world.

This is not America first; this is America alone.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Bond traders have lifted bets on interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve
amid concern that President Donald Trump’s trade war will backfire on the US
economy, sending the yield on benchmark Treasuries toward the closely-watched
4% level.&#34; Ten-year yields declined as much as nine basis points on Thursday
to 4.04%, the lowest level since October. Money markets started to price a
small chance of the Fed delivering four quarter-point rate reductions this
year, a scenario that wasn’t contemplated on Wednesday. Bob Michele, JPMorgan
Asset Management Chief Investment Officer and Head of the Global Fixed Income,
Currency &amp; Commodities group, breaks down the economic implications of the
latest trade war salvos and what he believes the Fed will do in response. Bob
speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>President Donald Trump’s shake-up of the global trading system is hurting US
assets more than those in many of the big economies he has just slapped with
additional tariffs. US equity index futures tumbled after Trump announced a
sweeping series of tariffs following the market close on Wednesday, and a
gauge of the dollar slumped. But the impact elsewhere was less extreme. The
Stoxx Europe 600 was down trading while the Euro was up against the dollar,
hitting its highest level since October. The widespread selloff in global
markets makes clear that investors don’t expect any winners from the latest --
and by the far the largest -- salvo in a growing trade war. The Opening Trade
has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis
you won&#39;t find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and
speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy

UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson

Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against the man accused of
fatally shooting the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, outside a Manhattan
hotel on 4 December, the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Tuesday.

Bondi said in a press release that she had “directed federal prosecutors to
seek the death penalty” for Luigi Mangione, 26, because he allegedly committed
“a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”. The move,
Bondi notes, was in an effort to “carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop
violent crime and Make America Safe Again”.

The European Union has a “strong plan” to retaliate against tariffs imposed by

Trump, who has upended eight decades of certainties about the transatlantic

As much as I have the general vibe of a luddite (strange hobbies, socially

automation: it’s nice that computers have made some boring things in our lives
less boring.

I side with the writer and philosopher John Gray, who in his terrifying work
of eco-nihilism Straw Dogs balances the fact that human beings are a plague
animal who are wrecking the biosphere that supports them with the idea that we
have made our lives easier through technology. Gray, in particular, calls
anaesthetised dentistry an “unmixed blessing”.

            <p>Elliott Ingram was stunned at how a thief made off with his Ioniq 5 deploying
a device to mimic the smart key – and says he should have been warned

The motor manufacturer Hyundai faces legal action over allegations it failed
to warn its customers that one of its most popular models of electric cars
could be stolen “effortlessly in seconds”. Elliott Ingram, an expert in
digital security, was stunned when a CCTV camera installed at his home
recorded a hooded thief stealing his Hyundai Ioniq 5 car in less than 20
seconds.

The thief is believed to have used a device, available online, to mimic the
car’s electronic key. It is the latest in a spate of thefts involving the
vehicle, and many owners now resort to a steering lock. Ingram’s car was later
recovered by police, but he is terminating the lease and seeking compensation
from the motor company. He says the South Korean car giant should have alerted
customers to the security vulnerabilities.

With the tariffs on Chinese goods mounting, China is trying to find a

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
