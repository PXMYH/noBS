The digital bank Monzo has been fined £21m over weak financial crime controls,
after it allowed customers to register for accounts with “implausible” home
addresses including 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and Monzo’s own
headquarters.

The Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) penalty follows a lengthy
investigation, which discovered that Monzo’s internal controls failed to keep
up with a rise in customers, which ballooned from 600,000 in 2018 to more than
5.8 million in 2022.

policies were left unchanged.

  * Trump delays tariff hikes again but announces new rates for some countries

US President Donald Trump has ramped up threats to impose punishing tariffs on
more than a dozen nations unless they can broker a deal before 1 August,
marking the latest phase in his trade war.

The tax duties stem from Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariff package that
was first announced in April, but then delayed for 90 days to allow for
negotiations. That deadline, initially scheduled to end this week, has now
been pushed back to August.

In a Slack message reviewed by the Guardian that went to thousands of white-

Shares in Tesla fell 6.8% by the close of US trading on Monday, wiping $79bn
(£60bn) off the company’s value, amid investor concern that Elon Musk’s launch
of a new political party will present further problems for the electric car
maker.

Tesla’s market capitalisation fell from just over $1tn to about $921bn after
stock markets closed on Wall Street, with the value of Musk’s stake in the

For months, Donald Trump has ranted on social media and, at one point,
threatened to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. Last week, he
took on a new, unusual tactic: a handwritten note.

his less compelling nicknames.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>We’ve been living in a great experiment: can finance provide basic human
rights such as housing? The answer is increasingly no

“The housing crisis is now as big a threat to the EU as Russia,” Jaume
Collboni, the mayor of Barcelona, recently declared. “We’re running the risk
of having the working and middle classes conclude that their democracies are
incapable of solving their biggest problem.”

It is not hard to see where Collboni is coming from. From Dublin to Milan,
residents routinely find half of their incomes swallowed up by rent, and home
ownership is unthinkable for most. Major cities are witnessing spiralling

more than 10%. People are being pushed into ever more precarious and cramped
conditions and homelessness is rapidly rising.

Twenty years ago this weekend, the leaders of the world’s most powerful

pits for the state’s cherry farmers

Nearly 100 years ago, north-west Michigan cherry farmers and Traverse City
community leaders started a festival to promote the city and their region’s
tart cherry crop as a tourist destination.

Now known as the “cherry capital of the world”, Traverse City’s National
Cherry Festival draws 500,000 visitors over eight days to this picturesque
Lake Michigan beach town to enjoy carnival rides and airshows, and to eat
cherries. It also sparked a thriving agrotourism industry amid its rolling
hills that now boasts dozens of shops, wineries, U-pick orchards, and farm-to-
table restaurants helmed by James Beard-award-winning chefs.

            <p>US is on the brink of launching a trade assault on dozens of countries as
90-day pause on tariffs is set to end on 9 July

When Donald Trump unveiled his “liberation day” tariffs in the spring, only to
pull the plug days later as panic tore through global markets, his officials
scrambled to present the climbdown as temporary.

Three months of frenetic talks would enable the Trump administration to strike
dozens of trade agreements with countries across the world, they claimed.
“We’re going to run,” the White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox
Business Network. “Ninety deals in 90 days is possible.”

            <p>Amy Hawkins visits one of the many bars popping up across Chinese cities
offering drinks, snacks and a vision of the future

In the age of self-help, self-improvement and self-obsession, there have never
been more places to look to for guidance. Where the anxious and the uncertain
might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in a
seemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT. Or, if you’re
in China, DeepSeek.

To some, though, it feels as if our ancestors knew more about life than we do.
Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young
Chinese are turning to ancient forms of divination to find out what the future
holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up
in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongside _xuanxue_ _,_ or
spiritualism. The trend makes sense: China’s economy is struggling, and
although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper
than other forms of retail therapy or an actual therapist. With a deep-rooted
culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which
have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious
beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.

Last November, Donald Trump made a solemn vow to all Americans: “Every
citizen, I will fight for you, your family and your future every single day.”
Eight months later, Trump is vigorously backing many policies that will mean
pain for millions.

Trump has pushed to enact the Republican budget bill, which would make
significant cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance, and would do the
greatest damage to those Americans struggling hardest to make ends meet – the
30% of the US population that lives in households earning under $50,000 a
year.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.
