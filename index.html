applicants, the federal government has announced.

Arthur Grand Technologies drew the scrutiny of anti-discrimination officials
when it went on the hiring site Indeed.com in March 2023 and published an ad
aiming to fill a business analyst vacancy while limiting applicants to “Only
US Born Citizens [white] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas”.

As US communities take big oil to court for allegedly deceiving the public
about the climate crisis, polling shared with the Guardian shows that a
majority of voters support the litigation, while almost half would back an
even more aggressive legal strategy of filing criminal charges.

The poll, which comes as the world’s first-ever criminal climate lawsuit was
brought in France last week, could shed light on how, if filed, similar US
cases might be viewed by a jury.

Neither a fat cat nor a ravening pack of post-apocalyptic Australian warlords

George Miller’s origins tale Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga just pipped pizza-loving
feline Garfield to the top spot, taking $32m (£25m) over the four days,
compared with Garfield’s $31.1m (£24m). Ghostly animation Casper took $22m
(£17m) over the same period in 1995, but ever since then receipts have been up
– excluding in 2020, when cinemas were entirely closed due to Covid.

A London-based billionaire non-dom left the UK for good on the day that the
chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced the scrapping of the 225-year-old tax
scheme in the spring budget, his tax adviser has revealed.

“We did have one billionaire client who literally on the day of the budget, 6
March, got on his private jet with his wife, with his children, with the
private tutor, and flew to one of his other 17 houses in the world – and said
‘I’m not coming back’,” said John Barnett, a partner at the law firm Burges
Salmon, which specialises in advising the super-rich on how to legally reduce
their tax bills.

            <p>**Exclusive:** Correspondence from pilots seen by Guardian Australia pleads
for changes to the roster system to address fatigue

Senior pilots at Virgin Australia have alleged fatigue is widespread in their
ranks and raised safety concerns about a roster system some claim is working
them “to the limits”.

Guardian Australia has obtained correspondence from senior pilots pleading for
action to address worker fatigue as Virgin Australia and the Transport Workers
Union (TWU) remain in a standoff over a proposal to strip pilots of six days’
annual leave during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement.

Multiple senior pilots say the rostering system used by Virgin is adding to
fatigue levels.

The system routinely schedules pilots to work maximum shift lengths – 11-12
hours and longer in the event of delays – on back-to-back days, while allowing
for just the legal minimum rest period of 12 hours.

Pilots have raised concerns with management about the roster software and
claim that the private equity owners of the airline, Bain Capital, have not
followed through on a promise to replace it.

Frustration at what they claim is management’s failure to recognise these
issues, or respond to staff warning of a resulting “clear, present and
increasing safety risk”.

Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic
recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a
Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found
persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer.

The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy,
including:

55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a
recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product
(GDP), has been growing.

49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the
index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year.

49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment
rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low.

The clamour to secure tickets for Taylor Swift’s sold-out UK shows is expected
to fuel a summer fraud bonanza as figures showed a “staggering” £1.2bn was
stolen from unwitting consumers in 2023.

Swift’s Eras tour, which arrives in the UK in June, and the Olympic Games, are
contenders for biggest ticketing scam of the year. The warning, from industry
group UK Finance, came as its annual fraud report revealed that the number of
people succumbing to a “purchase scam” in 2023 soared.

But beneath the surface, many low- and moderate-income families are
struggling.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
