            <p>Facing a severe drought and reliant on hydropower, the country is enduring
relentless blackouts. But experts say opportunities have been missed to adapt
and diversify

It’s 6.30pm in Quito, and Anamary Mazorra Vázquez’s **** flat has fallen into
darkness after weeks of government-mandated power cuts to manage Ecuador’s
electricity crisis. She puts clothes away by the light of her phone while her
husband, Roberto Vaca, **** seated on the bed by the window, uses the
streetlights to help feed their two-year-old son, who has special needs.

With a newborn and two toddlers to care for, Vázquez’s life has been turned
upside down by the blackouts, she says. These past weeks have been
particularly challenging, with power cuts from 4am to 11am, then again from
3pm to 10pm, leaving her with only four hours of electricity during the day.

With prices reflecting its status, however, fans are always on the lookout for

The sharp, repetitive sound of hammers steadily beating copper into shape
echoes around the fabrication hall on an industrial estate just outside
Edinburgh. At McMillan Coppersmiths in Prestonpans, metal workers wield heavy
wooden mallets, steel hammers and steel moulding tools called flatteners as
they coax curved sheets of copper into new stills for Scotland’s malt whisky
distillers.

They talk about planishing, where the welds that join the seams in the rose-
gold metal are hammered flat, and of tafting, where the copper is formed by
their hammers into the gentle curves of the still around hefty steel moulds.

Coppersmith Alphonso Martin shapes the head of the still

Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Nigel Lawson her chancellor of the
exchequer. Neil Kinnock was leader of the Labour party. The iron curtain

Bush described as “strange and unbelievable”.

Trump won because he promised to give voters what they wanted rather than what
America’s liberal elite thought they ought to want.

House staff with Trump loyalists

Scrambling to construct an administration in the wake of his shock victory
eight years ago, Donald Trump looked far beyond his inner circle, and those
who ardently embraced his agenda. Not this time.

The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of
the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his
campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his
agenda.

            <p>This week’s summit will focus on paying for the costs of global heating – and
much more money is needed

About 50,000 government officials, policymakers, investors and campaigners
will gather in Azerbaijan this week in the hope of answering a trillion-dollar
question: how much money should go each year to helping developing countries
cope with climate-related costs?

The aim of the UN’s Cop29 climate talks in Baku, which is being called the
“climate finance Cop”, is to establish a new annual climate financing target
to replace the current $100bn pledge, set in 2009, which expires at the end of
this year. There is one clear consensus already: the existing climate finance
available to developing countries is nowhere near enough to withstand
worsening climate impacts. The ambition is too low, and in 15 years the annual
target has been met in full only once, in 2022.

Tesla’s market value breached the $1tn mark in a sharp rally on Friday, on

for his support for President-elect Donald Trump in his poll campaign.

The electric automaker’s shares rose more than 6% to a more than two-year high

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
