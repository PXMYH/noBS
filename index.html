            <p>Computer and AI giant rolls out machine using ‘Heron’ chips using subatomic
particles instead of ones and zeros

The computer and artifical intelligence technology giant IBM on Monday
unveiled a new quantum computing chip and machine that the company says could
serve as the building blocks of much larger and faster systems than
traditional silicon-based computers.

IBM’s rollout of what it calls Quantum System Two, which uses three “Heron”
cryogenically cooled chips, comes as tech rivals including Microsoft,
Alphabet’s Google, China’s Baidu and others are racing to develop machines
that use quantum bits – subatomic particles that unlike the ones or zeros of
traditional computing can be in “superposition” of both one and zero at the
same time.

The Barclay family officially regained control of the Telegraph newspaper
group on Monday, after an Abu Dhabi-backed consortium helped pay off its
£1.2bn debt to Lloyds Banking Group, although the fund’s planned takeover
still requires the UK government’s blessing.

Lloyds said on Monday that it had received the money it was owed, after it
seized control of the group and put its Telegraph and Spectator titles up for
sale after a prolonged dispute over debts racked up by its owners, the
Barclays.

The US supreme court will hear oral arguments on Monday on whether members of
the wealthy Sackler family can receive immunity from civil prosecution under a
2019 bankruptcy deal agreed on with Purdue Pharma, the former manufacturer of
prescription painkiller OxyContin.

Under a court reorganization plan, Sackler family members who controlled the
Oxycontin maker were granted immunity and did not have to declare personal
bankruptcy in exchange for a $6bn settlement, paid out over 10 years, to a
fund created to offset costs created by the opioid dependency crisis that has
cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

The property developer Evergrande has been granted an extension until late

most high-profile cases in China’s long-running property crisis.

Evergrande was once China’s biggest property developer, but a default on

It has reported debts of more than $300bn (£237bn), much of it to individuals
whose properties were never built.

  *  **UK house prices rise for third straight month as mortgage rates fall**

The UK economy is showing signs of beginning to stabilise from the economic
slowdown triggered by soaring inflation and ever-higher interest rates, amid

            <p>Experts advise the city’s first AAPI female bookstore owner on a plan to
reopen Yu &amp; Me Books in its original location in Chinatown

For Lucy Yu, who runs what’s believed to be New York City’s first Asian

Chinatown building that housed Yu &amp; Me Books, the 29-year-old has had little
time to process her grief.

Within hours of the blaze, she shifted into rebuild mode: right after
firefighters brought the fire under control, Yu and a friend ran into the

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
