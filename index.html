            <p>The stampede from global equities gathered momentum Monday and investors piled
into haven assets as the fallout from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs
deepened. European stocks tumbled on Monday morning, approaching a bear
market. President Trump and his economic team dismissed investors’ fears of
inflation and recession, offering no apologies for the market turmoil and
defiantly insisting a boom is on the horizon. Trump, speaking Sunday on Air
Force One, struck a determined tone and repeatedly defended the tariff barrage
unveiled last week. He also drew something of a line in the sand, saying he
wouldn’t strike deals to cut the highest tariffs unless they eliminate the US
trade deficit with that country. Today&#39;s guests: Lucy Baldwin, Citi; Morris

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The carnage in financial markets unleashed by President Donald Trump’s tariffs
is continuing unabated as equities get pummeled and US stock futures show that
last week’s $5 trillion wipeout isn’t over. It’s a sea of red in Europe, with
major benchmarks falling sharply. The Euro Stoxx 600 fell more than 5%.
Concerns about the economic impact of the tariffs are pushing investors to
ramp up central bank rate-cut bets. Trump struck a defiant tone on his tariff
policy and dashed any hopes of a quick U-turn, telling reporters on Sunday
evening to “forget markets for a second.” The Opening Trade has everything you
need to know as markets open across Europe. Traders now expect the Fed to cut
another five times this year. With analysis you won&#39;t find anywhere else, we

  * People in the US: how have your shopping habits changed due to Trump’s tariffs?

It’s just two days since Donald Trump launched his extraordinary tariff

of globalization. But already shopkeepers are bracing for recession, and their
customers spending less, as they prepare to increase prices.

“We’re going to have to put our prices up and people aren’t going to like it,”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Donald Trump’s

economy, as stock markets were hit by a punishing worldwide sell-off by
investors.

Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the IMF, said it was important
that the US and its trading partners avoided further escalating Trump’s trade
war, while stock markets plunged on Friday as China retaliated against the
tariffs.

Trade tariffs imposed on tiny Australian territories that are either
uninhabited or claim to have no trading relationship with the US appear to
have been calculated based on erroneous trade data.

The data relates, at least in part, to shipments mislabelled as coming from
remote Norfolk Island, or Heard Island and McDonald Islands, instead of their
correct countries of origin, the Guardian can reveal.  
  
Among the erroneously labelled shipments over the past five years from the
island territories are shipments of aquarium systems, Timberland boots, wine
and parts for a recycling plant.

National home prices hit a new peak in March as February’s rate cut reignited
buyer demand, according to separate reports from Australia’s leading property
analytics companies.

Property values increased 0.4% over the month – the second consecutive month
of growth in the national index, CoreLogic reported, after a brief three-month
decline where values dipped 0.5%.

As much as I have the general vibe of a luddite (strange hobbies, socially

automation: it’s nice that computers have made some boring things in our lives
less boring.

I side with the writer and philosopher John Gray, who in his terrifying work
of eco-nihilism Straw Dogs balances the fact that human beings are a plague
animal who are wrecking the biosphere that supports them with the idea that we
have made our lives easier through technology. Gray, in particular, calls
anaesthetised dentistry an “unmixed blessing”.

            <p>Elliott Ingram was stunned at how a thief made off with his Ioniq 5 deploying
a device to mimic the smart key – and says he should have been warned

The motor manufacturer Hyundai faces legal action over allegations it failed
to warn its customers that one of its most popular models of electric cars
could be stolen “effortlessly in seconds”. Elliott Ingram, an expert in
digital security, was stunned when a CCTV camera installed at his home
recorded a hooded thief stealing his Hyundai Ioniq 5 car in less than 20
seconds.

The thief is believed to have used a device, available online, to mimic the
car’s electronic key. It is the latest in a spate of thefts involving the
vehicle, and many owners now resort to a steering lock. Ingram’s car was later
recovered by police, but he is terminating the lease and seeking compensation
from the motor company. He says the South Korean car giant should have alerted
customers to the security vulnerabilities.

A Canadian deep-sea mining firm has revealed it has been negotiating with the
Trump administration to bypass a UN treaty and potentially gain authorisation
from the US to mine in international waters.

The revelation has stunned environmentalists, who condemned the move as
“reckless” and a “slap in the face for multilateralism”.

Chinese vice-premier Ding Xuexiang has pledged to give stronger policy support
to the Chinese economy as he delivered the keynote speech at a forum focused
on bolstering the country’s role in Asia and ties with the global south.

With the tariffs on Chinese goods mounting, China is trying to find a
foundation for growth that does not rely on an increasingly capricious United
States. At the Boao Forum for Asia, a conference in south China’s Hainan
province, Chinese officials and academics stressed the need for partnerships
with global south countries. Despite its rapid economic growth in the past
three decades, China still identifies as being part of this group.

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
