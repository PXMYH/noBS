The investment firm State Street, the company that commissioned the Fearless

goals.

Last year in its proxy voting and engagement policy the company said that it

directors. State Street warned that it might vote against the nominating
committee or the board leader if a company failed to meet the expectation.

Jeffrey Epstein deployed a consultant to push for Jes Staley to become
Barclays’ chief executive in 2012, a court was told on Tuesday, with the
ultimately failed campaign – called “Project Jes” – having planned to target
high-profile figures including the then chancellor, George Osborne, and the
then Bank of England governor, Mervyn King.

The campaign’s efforts were detailed as part of a landmark legal case launched
by Staley against the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Staley is trying to overturn its 2023 decision to ban him from taking senior
roles in the UK’s financial sector for having allegedly misled the regulator
over the depth of his relationship with the convicted sex offender Epstein.

When Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s “truck of the future” in 2019, Filipos could
barely contain his excitement. He quickly paid $100 to get on the waitlist.
Filipos described himself as a “true Tesla fanboy”, and the Cybertruck would
be the third vehicle he’d buy from the company.

“When the Cybertruck came out, I watched the live event that night, and my
wife was sitting there going, ‘No. No. No,’” said Filipos, who lives in a
suburb of Philadelphia and whose last name is being withheld for fear of
online retribution. Despite his wife’s disapproval, Filipos loved the bulky

            <p>Dismissing 6,700 IRS workers during tax season is a recipe for chaos but AI’s
disruption will be much more widespread

The Trump administration recently announced that it would be laying off
approximately 6,700 workers at the Internal Revenue Service, about 8% of the
people employed by the agency. Tens of thousands of federal employees at other
agencies are also losing their jobs.

The timing could not be worse. We’re in the middle of the tax season with
corporations and individuals facing filing deadlines in March and April.

An Elon Musk ally installed in the US government said in a late night email
going into Saturday that the office behind a popular free online tax filing
option would be shuttered – and its employees would be let go.

The 18F office within the General Services Administration (GSA) created the
IRS Direct File program that allows for free online tax filings. It has been a
frequent target of Musk, and one of the billionaire businessman’s close
associates who holds a key position in the GSA informed staffers that the
agency would close 18F in an email to staffers that arrived around 1am on
Saturday morning.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
