            <p>People’s Bank of China cuts interest rates due to global uncertainty and
‘trade tensions’

 **Joshua Mahony** , analyst at Scope Markets, has looked at the moves in
financial markets.

European markets have kicked off the day in rather uncertain fashion... This
comes as traders weigh up the potential for progress between the US and China,
with talks due to get underway in Switzerland [at the weekend]. The response
to that news has been surprisingly muted, with the Shanghai composite (up
0.8%) providing the one bright spot as domestic Chinese optimism builds.
Nonetheless, coming off the back of a one-month period that has seen sharp
gains for the DAX (+17%), IBEX (14%), Eurostoxx (13%), FTSE 100 (11%), and CAC
(10%), it comes as no surprise that much of the upside of a resumption in US-
China trade talks have been baked in.

The DAX remains within touching distance of the all-time high of 23,479. In
spite of those US-centric concerns, the German economy remains in a more
positive position as the new chancellor **Friedrich Merz** looks to bring
forth a new phase of increased spending and a potential resurgence for German
business activity.

Looking ahead, today’s FOMC [federal open market committee] meeting
undoubtedly provides the main event of note, with traders watching out for
commentary from [Fed chair **Jerome] Powell** over the direction of travel for
rates in the face of economic uncertainty. The sheer number of unknowns mean
that we are highly unlikely to see the Fed cut rates this time around.
However, the events of the past week have also seen markets lose confidence
over the potential for a June cut, with a pause going from a 33% outside
chance to the 70% base case.

Nonetheless, traders still expect to see the bank cut rates another 3-4 times
this year, and thus the outlook provided by Powell today will likely help
inform markets over the direction of travel for rates. The recent better-than-
expected jobs and ISM PMI data does ease the pressure on the Fed to act
swiftly, and thus there is a hope that **Donald Trump** can mend the
relationship with China before the economy rolls over.

            <p>The unpredictability of the US president’s tariff policy on Mexico has already
cost ranchers millions in profit losses

Bandannas veiled ranchers’ mouths and noses, shielding them from heavy dust
clouds kicked up by the Mexican herds of cattle crossing the United States-
Mexico border. The scene looks timeless, routine. The uncertainty isn’t.

In Donald Trump’s first 100 days, the borderland’s cattle industry faces a
huge challenge: threats of a trade war that’s already hitting consumers in the
gut with rising beef prices, from Texas to New York. The on-again, off-again
tariff impositions and worries in February and March jolted Mexican cattle
producers with mounting economic losses.

Donald Trump appears to be softening his tone after widespread dismay in

films “produced in foreign lands”, saying he was “not looking to hurt the
industry”.

In remarks reported by CNBC, Trump said he was planning to discuss the plan

When Garrett Petters, a 29-year-old architect in Dallas, and his girlfriend
travelled to Paris last year, one of their favourite parts was eating out.
They enjoyed French duck, andouillette, plenty of bread, cheese and coffee and
even escargot.

But it wasn’t just Paris’s cuisine they admired. It was also the different
tipping culture. “We were talking about how nice it is in Europe that they pay

Barbie maker Mattel has said it will increase prices for some products in the

The US represents about half of Mattel’s global toy sales, and the company
imports about 20% of its goods sold in the country from China. Mattel said it
would reduce imports into the US from China to below 15% by 2026.

Sydney businessman Robert Jarmyn had a $250,000 shipment of skincare products
en route to the US from China when Donald Trump declared his new tariffs

Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the
shipping world and an economic driver of California’s huge economy. The
busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world,
approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock,
moving billions of dollars’ worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts,
toys, clothes and furniture.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
