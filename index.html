• Business live – latest updates

The European Commission has opened an investigation into the owner of Facebook
and Instagram over concerns that the platforms are creating addictive
behaviour among children and damaging mental health.

The EU executive said Meta may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA), a
landmark law passed by the bloc last summer that makes digital companies large
and small liable for disinformation, shopping scams, child abuse and other
online harms.

            <p>OpenAI’s updated chatbot GPT-4o is weirdly flirtatious, coquettish and sounds
like Scarlett Johansson in Her. Why?

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” Arthur
C Clarke famously said. And this could certainly be said of the impressive
OpenAI update to ChatGPT, called GPT-4o, which was released on Monday. With
the slight caveat that it felt a lot like the magician was a horny 12-year-old
boy who had just watched the Spike Jonze movie Her.

If you aren’t up to speed on GPT-4o (the o stands for “omni”) it’s basically
an all-singing, all-dancing, all-seeing version of the original chatbot. You
can now interact with it the same way you’d interact with a human, rather than
via text-based questions. It can give you advice, it can rate your jokes, it
can describe your surroundings, it can banter with you. It sounds _human._ “It
feels like AI from the movies,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post on
Monday. “Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to
be a big change.”

A “deal” allegedly offered by Donald Trump to big-oil executives as he sought
$1bn in campaign donations could save the industry $110bn in tax breaks if he
returns to the White House, an analysis suggests.

The fundraising dinner held last month at Mar-a-Lago with more than 20
executives, including from Chevron, Exxon and Occidental Petroleum, reportedly
involved Trump asking for large campaign contributions and promising, if
elected, to remove barriers to drilling, scrap a pause on gas exports, and
reverse new rules aimed at cutting car pollution.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Nobel-winning US economist’s championing of government intervention to
nullify neoliberal excesses is ardently expressed but unconvincing

In 2009, the American government loaned almost half a billion dollars to Elon
Musk’s Tesla corporation to hasten the development of electric car technology.
What did it think it was playing at? Didn’t it remember what Ronald Reagan
said? “The most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the
government and I’m here to help,’” the late president told a 1986 press
conference.

For Reagan and the brains behind his neoliberal puppet, the role of government
is to get out of the way and let the unfettered orgy of self-interested
neoliberal economic life express itself as nature intended. Taxation is theft
and interventionist industrial policy always a mistake, except when it
involves bailing out failing banks in reward for tanking the economy.

            <p>Experts say Biden can win back working-class Americans if he hammers home the

To the dismay of Democrats, blue-collar voters have lined up increasingly
behind Donald Trump, but political experts say Joe Biden can still turn things
around with that large and pivotal group by campaigning hard on “kitchen
table” economic issues.

With just six months to go until the election, recent polls show that Trump
has stronger support among blue-collar Americans than he did in 2020. But
several political analysts told the Guardian that Biden can bring back enough
of those voters to win if he hammers home the message that he is helping
Americans on pocketbook issues – for instance, by canceling student debt and
cutting insulin prices.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
