The US transportation department said on Tuesday it was opening an

US existing home sales fell more than expected in June as the median house
price set another record high, but improving supply and declining mortgage
rates offered hope that activity could rebound in the months ahead.

Home sales dropped 5.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.89m units, the lowest level since December, the National Association of
Realtors said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home
resales would slip to a rate of 4m units.

Two-fifths of British growers of strawberries and raspberries could go out of
business by the end of 2026 amid rising costs and poor pay from supermarkets,
according to a study.

Almost half of British growers said they no longer make a profit and 53%
reported the financial health of their business as bad or very bad, according
to a survey by British Berry Growers (BBG), an industry body that represents
farmers producing 95% of the berries sold in the UK.

An investigation into the abuse of women working to supply frankincense to a
leading US essential oils brand built on ethical sourcing has left workers
unpaid and frightened, with some saying they were told to change their stories
“or face the consequences”.

Last year doTERRA, which sells essential oils and other wellness products to a
mostly female customer base, launched an investigation into its frankincense
supplier in Somaliland after reporting by the Fuller Project uncovered
allegations of serious abuses, including sexual harassment and assault. Many
women hired as frankincense sorters said they were routinely underpaid and

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>As the world recovers from the largest IT outage in history, it shows the
danger of one point of failure in IT infrastructure

A global IT failure wreaked havoc on Friday, grounding flights and disrupting
everything from hospitals to government agencies. Over all the chaos hung a
question: how did a flawed update to Microsoft Windows software bring large
swaths of society to a screeching halt?

The problem originated with an Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm called
CrowdStrike, relied upon by much of the global technology industry, including
Microsoft, for its Falcon program, which blocks the execution of malware and
cyber-attacks. Falcon protects devices by securing access to a wide range of
internal systems and automatically updating its defenses – a level of
integration that means if Falcon falters, the computer is close behind. After
CrowdStrike updated Falcon on Thursday night, Microsoft systems and Windows
PCs were hit with a “blue screen of death” and rendered unusable as they were
trapped in a recovery boot loop.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>It’s not that the outfits are necessarily bad, although many of them are. Have
we lost something in the transition away from the coat-and-tie?

The business casual revolution of the 1990s and rise of tech billionaires in
the early aughts supposedly ushered in a new era that freed employees from the
shackles of dress codes. Mark Zuckerberg turned hoodies and jeans into a
symbol of New Economy meritocracy, the uniform of whiz kid hackers shaking up
the coat-and-tie aesthetic of traditional industries back east. In the digital
economy, many imagined, the most successful companies would allow talented
employees to wear whatever they wanted as they jumped around in colorful ball
pits.

But as Facebook engineer Carlos Bueno wrote in his 2014 blogpost Inside the
Mirrortocracy, we simply traded our hard-written dress codes for softly coded
dress norms. The new world is actually not so free. The cognitive dissonance
is plain to see on the faces of recruiters who pretend clothing is no big
deal, but are clearly disappointed if you show up to a job interview in a dark
worsted business suit. “You are expected to conform to the rules of The
Culture before you are allowed to demonstrate your actual worth,” wrote Bueno.
“What wearing a suit really indicates is – I am not making this up – non-
conformity, one of the gravest of sins.”

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
