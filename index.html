France has told its farmers that any action to block access to Paris’s main
market for fresh food would be crossing a red line as a tractor protest made
good on a threat to blockade the city for an indefinite period, stopping
traffic on eight main motorways into the capital in a row over regulations,
pay and taxes.

As it became clear the farmers planned to encircle the city, the French
president, Emmanuel Macron, held a crisis meeting with key cabinet ministers
on what was being called “Operation Paris Siege”. Prisca Thevenot, a
government spokesperson, said announcements would be made on Tuesday. “The
whole government and the president are mobilised,” she said.

Clifford Robert, an attorney representing Trump and his family, wrote in a
court filing that the court-appointed monitor overseeing the embattled Trump
Organization is a “Javert” figure – a reference to the main antagonist in
Victor Hugo’s 1862 novel Les Misérables and the musical it inspired – looking
to maintain power over Trump and his company.

departure of its chief executive.

            <p>Luxury vehicles, production cuts and soaring insurance prices have sent the
cost of US car ownership out of control

At the start of the pandemic, Ceola Luna, a 45-year-old Lyft driver in Los
Angeles, bought a 2005 Saturn Vue crossover, after her new Dodge Caravan (a
minivan) was wrecked in a crash. The Vue wasn’t nearly as nice, but it was
affordable at $4,000 – including rust, engine issues and a dashboard full of
warning lights.

With no other income to support herself and three children, driving was an
economic lifeline for Luna. But much of what she made ended up going to car
mechanics as the small SUV kept breaking down. Then last year, Lyft informed
Luna that her Vue had gotten too old for the platform, leaving her jobless. So
she scrambled to find a new gig as a care worker for autistic children, and
then the car failed again. To save up for another mechanic appointment, Luna
has been taking the bus to her clients – sapping her earnings with hours of
unpaid commute time.

Millions of households will still be living in fuel poverty by the end of the
decade, and could be forced to pay almost £500 a year extra on their bills
because of the government’s slow progress on meeting its home energy
efficiency targets, according to a study.

A fuel poverty charity has found that 3m households in England are expected to
remain in fuel poverty by 2030 because the government is expected to miss a
legally binding target on upgrading the energy efficiency of homes “by a
staggering margin”.

            <p>For years, the company has focused on costs at the expense of its engineering
heritage. Now the numbers look bad too

Aviation jargon can hide all kinds of horrors. This month Boeing introduced a
new phrase to a wider audience – _Quality escape_ _(n.)_ : part of a 737 Max

            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
