A parliamentary committee examining the impact of social media on Australian
society has recommended users be given the power to alter, reset or turn off
algorithms, as well as be provided with greater privacy protection, but has
stopped short of recommending a ban on under-16s accessing social media.

The wide-ranging inquiry, which was predominantly focused on the impact of
social media on young people, came as both the Coalition opposition and the
federal government adopted a policy to ban under-16s from social media pending
legislation to be introduced into parliament before the end of the year.

The average asking price for a UK home has dropped by more than £5,000 this
month as the autumn budget caused housing market jitters before the usual
Christmas slowdown.

Average asking prices from new sellers fell by £5,366, or 1.4%, in November to
£366,592, compared with the 0.8% decline usually recorded at this time of
year, according to the website Rightmove.

Chinese online marketplace Temu has enjoyed explosive international growth off
the back of an eye-catching and often absurdly cheap range of products, but
those cut-price tactics have met increasing roadblocks as it seeks to conquer
new markets in south-east Asia.

Indonesia ordered Temu to be taken down from app stores in October, a move it
said would protect the country’s smaller merchants. Last week, Vietnam
threatened to ban Temu and fellow Chinese-owned fast-fashion outlet Shein by
the end of the month, saying they had not been approved to do business in the
country.

Big UK businesses including Ovo, SSE and BT Openreach are urging the
government to stick to current electric car targets as struggling carmakers
pile pressure on ministers to relax the rules before industry talks this week.

The businesses said the zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which forces
carmakers to sell greater numbers of electric cars each year, is an essential
part of the plan to reduce the carbon and air pollution emissions caused by
vehicles on Britain’s roads.

Elon Musk has publicly weighed in on Donald Trump’s choice for US treasury
secretary, one of the remaining key incoming cabinet nominations the
president-elect will make in the coming days.

Musk urged followers on X to support a candidate that would not be “business
as usual” and “will actually enact change” as he threw his support behind
Trump’s transition co-chair Howard Lutnick to lead the treasury department.

Over the past few months, major corporations such as Disney, Apple, Starbucks
and Amazon announced new policies mandating their employees to cut back on
working from home and return to their offices for as much as five days a week.
The moves were met with backlashes from employees who signed petitions, sent
public letters to their CEOs, complained to the press and on social media, and
even went on strike.

You would think that I, a business owner, would agree with the executives at
those companies. I don’t. Those employees are right and their bosses are
making a big mistake. The reality today is that you can’t mandate people to
come into the office. Here’s why.

Scrambling to construct an administration in the wake of his shock victory
eight years ago, Donald Trump looked far beyond his inner circle, and those
who ardently embraced his agenda. Not this time.

The president-elect has charged Howard Lutnick, a longtime friend, and one of
the few high-profile figures in corporate America to vocally endorse his
campaign, with recruiting officials who will deliver, rather than dilute, his
agenda.

Most nights, under cover of darkness, Sandra* ventures underground into the
Huanuni tin mine, about 40 miles (60km) south of the city of Oruro, in
Bolivia. She walks for around nine hours collecting about 35kg of rocks
containing the mineral before heading back the way she came, hiding from
anyone who might be patrolling the tunnels.

She sells what she collects through unofficial channels and typically makes
1,800 to 3,000 Bolivianos (£200 to £330) a week.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
