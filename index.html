            <p>President challenging federal appeals court decision that ‘liberation day’
levies on imports overstepped his powers

  * Business live – latest updates

Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to overturn a lower court decision
that most of his sweeping trade tariffs were illegal.

The US president filed a petition late on Wednesday to ask for a review of
last week’s federal appeals court ruling in Washington DC, which centred on
his “liberation day” border taxes introduced on 2 April that imposed levies of
between 10% and 50% on most US imports and sent shock waves through global
trade and markets.

            <p>Judge said tech giant had monopoly but let it keep Chrome and Android; critics
cried foul while Wall Street cheered

A judge ruled on Tuesday that Google would not be forced to sell its Chrome
browser or the Android operating system, saving the tech giant from the most
severe penalties sought by the US government. The same judge had ruled in
favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and
maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.

Groups critical of Google’s dominance in the internet search and online
advertising industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity
to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the
crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by
contrast, are thrilled. Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have
risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.

            <p>Exclusive: Experts say the move could be part of Beijing’s ‘greyzone’ grab for
disputed territory

China is drilling for oil and gas inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), a move that analysts believe is likely part of Beijing’s unilateral
grab for disputed territory that could also aid a future invasion of Taiwan.

During July and August at least 12 oil and gas vessels and permanent
structures were detected inside Taiwan’s EEZ – including one within 50km of
the restricted-waters border of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands – as well
as several steel supports for fixed offshore drilling platforms, called
jackets. Their presence inside Taiwan’s EEZ have not been previously reported.

One of the world’s most prominent hedge fund billionaires has warned that

business leaders for failing to speak out against Donald Trump’s policies.

Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, said “gaps in wealth” and a

The price of gold has hit a fresh record high, as investors seek out safe-
haven assets to protect against inflationary and geopolitical risks.

Gold rose above $3,500 (£2,614) an ounce, surpassing its April peak. It has
nearly doubled in value since early 2023. The rally comes as the US dollar has
weakened and some central banks add to their gold holdings, ditching US
government bonds, known as US treasuries.

The tide has turned. The great migration – when the shift to remote work
prompted people to quit their jobs in droves – is officially over. Now comes
the big hold.

According to a new survey from consulting firm Robert Half, 73% of respondents
– workers at companies – said they plan to stay in their current roles through
2025. They gave reasons like having “positive company culture” and “feeling
professionally fulfilled” or “being well compensated” at their current job.
But there’s also a fourth reason why so many are staying put: the job market
isn’t great and people are worried.

Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the

suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”
commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) found that despite

single pilot could be as safe as with the two currently required.

on the benefits of the American way.

He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party
– that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
