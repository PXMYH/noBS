in wake of scrutiny of its president

The Teamsters International, a powerful US transportation workers union that
represents over 1.3 million workers, declined to endorse a candidate ahead of

members backed Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.

Polling conducted before Joe Biden, who in 2023 became the first sitting

Heinz and PepsiCo.

Seven are on course to miss meeting emissions targets they have set themselves
to achieve by 2050.

  * Business live – latest updates

Tupperware, the lossmaking 78-year-old American plastic food container brand,
has filed for bankruptcy and is on the hunt for new owners as it attempts to
lure younger customers.

The company, which was founded by the chemist Earl Tupper in 1946 and became
known for its patented “burping” seal, has started US chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings as bosses said that its finances had been “severely impacted” by
the economic environment.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Elisa Mantin’s film shows Greeks as the economic victims of ideologically
motivated EU forces, imposing punishment-via-austerity

Maybe the true Greek tragedy is the temptation to interpret everything that
happens in that country under the long Hellenic shadow of history. It is
former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who suggests here that the 2010s debt
crisis was akin to an ancient tragedy, with the likes of him, prime minister
Alexis Tsipras and a slowly strangulated populace at the mercy of overweening
Olympian (or rather, European) forces. We should probably pay attention to the
idea – but maybe more so to his parting suggestion that this drama doesn’t
completely conform to the classical pattern, either.

Director Elisa Mantin’s melancholic but partisan film makes it clear that the
hubris was on the Euro troika side. Varoufakis, a sympathetic François
Hollande, a clutch of former Syriza ministers, and others describe the
ideologically motivated chastising-via-austerity of the country by a Brussels
technocracy for whom, says Varoufakis, Greek democracy was an afterthought.
The negotiations took place in brutalising 10-hour Eurogroup meetings that
were unrecorded and unminuted – all the better to spin things in the press
later.

One of America’s biggest carmakers, Stellantis, could face fresh strikes after

The UAW president, Shawn Fain, accused executives at the automotive giant of
being “out of control” on Tuesday evening. “The company wants you to be
scared,” he told his union’s members, “but we are 100% within our rights and
within our power to take strike action if necessary.”

offer are eggs any style you wish, a range of pastries and eight types of mac
and cheese. The kitchen isn’t the main point, though.

Iva Walsh, a single mother of four who immigrated to the US from the Czech
Republic in the late 1980s, opened the upstate New York establishment in 2018
to provide work opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Her roster of nine employees includes her 26-year-old daughter, after whom the
business is named. Walsh’s son, Daniel Hellmayer, a 41-year-old Culinary
Institute of America graduate, works at the cafe as a full-time chef.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
