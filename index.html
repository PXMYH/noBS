            <p>United Airlines’ latest bright idea for efficient boarding is a nonstarter –
radical thinking is required

As a frequent business traveler, I was excited to see that United Airlines has
devised a way to fix what is one of my – and most other business travelers’ –
biggest pet peeves.

No, it’s not sitting next to that guy wearing open-toed sandals. Or the person
next to me who brought onboard a large rotisserie chicken with gravy for

The United Auto Workers (UAW) reached a tentative labor deal with Chrysler
owner Stellantis on Saturday, two sources said, moving closer to securing
record wage hikes and a new life for a Jeep factory shut down earlier this
year.

The tentative deal is a big step towards ending the first simultaneous strike
against the so-called “Detroit Three” automakers, and will follow a template
set just days ago by UAW and Ford, including a 25% wage hike over the
4.5-year-long contract.

Some of Britain’s biggest retailers, including Tesco, John Lewis and
Sainsbury’s, have been urged to pull out of a new policing strategy amid
warnings it risks wrongly criminalising people of colour, women and LGBTQ+
people.

A coalition of 14 human rights groups has written to the main retailers – also
including Marks &amp; Spencer, the Co-op, Next, Boots and Primark – saying that
their participation in a new government-backed scheme that relies heavily on
facial recognition technology to combat shoplifting will “amplify existing
inequalities in the criminal justice system”.

One of the world’s biggest wind turbine makers has reignited concerns over the

A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies singles out which 100

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in
2022, while their CEOs took home an average $15.3m.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
