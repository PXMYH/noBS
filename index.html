tariffs on his country’s imports and sanctions against its officials, as the
two men held what the Brazilian presidency called a “friendly” video call,
swapping phone numbers after months of friction.

Ties between the US and Brazil have nosedived as a result of Trump’s campaign

To many Americans, the economy of the past five years has been rough. Prices
have soared yet pay remains stagnant. High mortgage rates have made buying a
home a dismal prospect. The unemployment rate has been creeping up.

            <p>Sick of scrolling through junk results, AI-generated ads and links to
lookalike products? The author and activist behind the term ‘enshittification’
explains what’s gone wrong with the internet – and what we can do about it

It’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely
on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once.
Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI
slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on
the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And,
depending on how important those services are to you, _terrifying_.

In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going
on all around us: _enshittification_. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that
word is doing big numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It isn’t
just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way
an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion
that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.

            <p>The move comes as GLP-1 drug prices have soared as supply continues to be
increasingly limited

Costco has struck an agreement with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to make anti-
obesity GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy available to its members
at roughly half the usual cost.

Through the store’s prescription program, members with a valid prescription
can buy a four-week supply of the injectables for $499. The offer is available
only to those paying out of pocket, since many insurers still do not cover
these medications.

            <p>Indigenous groups in Mexico opposed to the planned brewery say families
already have little access to water – and that their way of life is also under
threat

On a summer evening in southern Mexico, a percussion group using water bottles
as instruments leads a procession through Mérida, capital of Yucatán state.
Children walking alongside elderly people are guided by members of Múuch’
Xíinbal, a Maya land rights organisation. The placards they carry declare:
“Water is not for sale.” A heavy chant accompanies the march: “It’s not a
drought – it’s plunder!”

At a rallying point in the city, protesters read from a manifesto and accuse
the government of prioritising profit over water, health and land. They
denounce a wave of mega-projects imposed without their consent, from
industrial-scale pig farms to the controversial Maya Train tourist expansion.
But they reserve their greatest anger for the Heineken brewery in Kanasín,
near Mérida, which was announced in June.

Zink &amp; Sons has made bespoke suits on Sydney’s Oxford Street for 130 years.
For most of that time, the family-owned men’s tailoring business has resided

Taylor Square. Today its director, Daniel Jones, is looking for a new base
after a rent increase he says is unaffordable.

His shop is located in a development project that has been almost six years in
the making. Oxford and Foley, a commercial strip of renovated heritage
buildings, has been touted as key to revitalising the storied and colourful
street, bringing new retail, hospitality and creative spaces, upmarket tenants

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
