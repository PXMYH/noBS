            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>For most, 29 February is an ordinary working day – but depending on your pay
structure, you could earn a bit more

It’s a leap year once again which means workers are doing a 366-day year. So
what does it mean for Americans’ pay?

If you’re an hourly worker, the answer is straightforward, says Leticia
Saucedo, the Martin Luther King Jr professor of law at the University of
California, Davis: you’re certainly entitled to pay. And hours worked on the
29th aren’t considered overtime – “it’s just another workday”, says Reuel
Schiller, Roger J Traynor chair and professor of law at UC Law San Francisco.

The state of New York is suing the US arm of JBS, the world’s largest
meatpacker, accusing the Brazilian company of misleading customers over its
climate goals, including a plan to reach net zero carbon neutral standards by
2040.

Letitia James, the New York attorney general, filed the suit alleging that JBS
USA had repeatedly assured the public and consumers with sustainability claims
that could, in effect, “provide environmentally conscious consumers with a

– or cause mass misery. The choice is ours

As artificial intelligence spreads rapidly across America’s economy, there’s a
lively debate about how it will transform the future of work. What many people
fail to realize is that AI has already changed millions of workers’ jobs –
often for the worse.

At Amazon, some warehouse and delivery drivers complain that AI-driven bots
have fired them without any human intervention whatsoever. At some companies,
surveillance apps track how much time workers spend in trips to the bathroom,
with some workers protesting that the time limits are too strict.

Tech companies say new Australian safety standards will inadvertently make it
harder for generative AI systems to detect and prevent online child abuse and
pro-terrorism material.

Under two mandatory standards aimed at child safety released in draft form by
the regulator last year, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, proposed
providers detect and remove child-abuse material and pro-terrorism material
“where technically feasible”, as well as disrupt and deter new material of
that nature.

for use in the traditional recipe

  * Photographs by Marco Massa and Haakon Sand

For most of winter and spring in 2022, Luigi Ferraris, a 58-year-old rice
farmer from Mortara, a town in the Po valley, remained hopeful. Rainfall had
been down 40% in the first six months of the year, and snow had accumulated
thinly in the Alps, prompting an 88% drop in the amount of water coming to the
Po River from snow-melt; flow in the river and its connected canals was at a
historic low.

But Ferraris believed things would soon return to normal. “I thought the lack
of water would be temporary,” he says.

            <p>Disgraced cryptocurrency mogul faces 100 years for wire fraud and conspiracy
to launder money, a term his lawyer calls ‘barbaric’

Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyer said on Tuesday that a suggested 100-year prison
sentence for the FTX founder would be “grotesque” and “barbaric” and at most a
term of a few years behind bars would be appropriate for crimes that the
disgraced cryptocurrency mogul still disputes.

In pre-sentencing arguments filed just minutes before a late Tuesday deadline
in Manhattan federal court, attorney Marc Mukasey said a report by probation
officers improperly calculated federal sentencing guidelines to recommend a
sentence just 10 years short of the maximum potential 110-year sentence.
Bankman-Fried, known for his casual clothing and wild hair, was convicted of
seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money in November.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
