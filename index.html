            <p>The growing threat of fires has shaken the Napa valley wine industry, as fears
of smoke-spoiled grapes and soaring insurance rates put vintners on edge

Elton Slone and his colleagues at the Robert Craig Winery in Napa valley had
gathered for their annual pre-harvest company party last week – complete with
copper pot carnitas and grape tacos – when one of his co-workers noticed an
alert on her phone. The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles
(16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on
Howell Mountain.

Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blaze that damaged numerous wineries and
spoiled a year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel
remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the
week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for
the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property
to control the larger fire.

Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the

suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”
commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) found that despite
advances in technology there was not sufficient evidence that flying with a
single pilot could be as safe as with the two currently required.

on the benefits of the American way.

He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party
– that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and
markets the space the thrive, without intervention – into a simple mantra:
_trust the people_.

Tesla sales slumped 40% across Europe in July compared with a year earlier as
Elon Musk’s electric car company faces increasingly tough competition from its

There were 8,837 sales of Tesla cars last month across the EU, the European

Chipmaker Nvidia set a fresh sales record in the second quarter, surpassing

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
