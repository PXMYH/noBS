amid fears over tariffs and economy

Sales at Target fell more than expected in the first quarter, and the retailer
warned they will slip for all of 2025 year as its customers, worried over the
impact of tariffs and the economy, pull back on spending.

Target also said that customer boycotts have also done some damage during the
latest quarter. The company scaled back many diversity, equity and inclusion
(DEI) initiatives in January after they came under attack by conservative
activists and the White House. Target’s retreat created another backlash, with
more customers angered by the retailer’s reduction of LGBTQ+-themed
merchandise for Pride month in June of 2023.

Marks &amp; Spencer has said it will take an estimated £300m hit to profits this

business into July.

Its chief executive, Stuart Machin, confirmed that “threat actors” had gained
access to the retailer’s systems via one of M&amp;S’s contractors using “social
engineering” techniques, which can include posing as a staff member to fool a
helpdesk.

Planting season is well under way across the US. And while farmers welcome
news that the US and Chinese officials agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs
placed on exports, plenty of uncertainty remains.

China is one of the top three importers of US food commodities, behind Canada
and Mexico, and the escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has
worried farmers - particularly grain farmers, who lost money on last year’s
harvest as bumper crops weighed on prices.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Instead of cutting taxes on the richest Americans – who hold much of the
country’s debt – simply raise them

On Friday, the credit rating of the United States was downgraded. Moody’s, the
ratings firm, announced that the government’s rising debt levels would grow
further if the Trump Republican package of new tax cuts were enacted. This
makes lending to the US riskier.

Moody’s is the third of the three major credit-rating agencies to downgrade
the credit rating of the United States.

They’ll pay even _more_ interest on the growing debt – to the super-rich.

They’ll pay higher interest rates on all other long-term debt. (As higher
rates on treasury bonds waft through the economy, they raise borrowing costs
on everything from mortgages to auto loans.)

The debt crisis will give Republicans even more excuse to do what they’re
always wanting to do: slash safety nets. So many Americans could lose benefits
they rely on, such as Medicaid and food stamps.

emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a Guardian US
columnist. His newsletter is at robertreich.substack.com

If Chinese carmakers are to be believed, a lot of people really love karaoke.
Those people love karaoke so much that they want it in their family car.

This was not something the European mind could comprehend a few years ago,
according to Volkswagen’s chief financial officer, Arno Antlitz. Yet the
technology, included in electric cars sold by China’s BYD and Xpeng, is just
one example of the lessons that Volkswagen and its European counterparts have
had to learn as they scramble to keep up with Chinese rivals on track to
dominate the global electric car market.

Colorado oil and gas companies have pumped at least 30m lbs of secret
chemicals into the ground over the past 18 months without making legally
required disclosures, according to a new analysis.

That’s in spite of first-in-the-nation rules requiring operators and their
suppliers to list all chemicals used in drilling and extraction, while also
banning any use of Pfas “forever chemicals” at oil and gas sites. Since the
transparency law took effect in July 2023, operators have fracked 1,114 sites
across the state, but as of 1 May chemical disclosures have not been filed for
675 of them – more than 60% of the total, the analysis says.

Hollywood’s actors’ union filed an unfair labor practice charge against Epic
Games on Monday, alleging the company replaced actors’ work by using
artificial intelligence to generate Darth Vader’s voice in Fortnite without
notice.

The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
said Llama Productions, a subsidiary of the gaming giant, “failed and refused
to bargain in good faith with the union” in the last six months. The company
made unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of employment “without
providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain” by using AI-
generated voices to replace bargaining unit work, Sag-Aftra said. Epic Games
did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
