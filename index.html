stores to better protect children, the same day that the Senate began
investigating Meta’s failures to shield children using its platforms.

In a blogpost titled Parenting in a Digital World Is Hard. Congress Can Make
It Easier, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global head of safety, called for federal
legislation that would mandate app stores to notify parents whenever a child
between the age of 13 and 16 downloads an app, and would solicit the parents’
approval. Children under 13 are already prohibited from creating accounts and
downloading apps without a parent’s go-ahead.

            <p>Artificial intelligence will bring huge changes to the world of work – and
dangers for society. Some think they can be solved by just handing everyone
money. Is there a catch?

The idea of a guaranteed income for all has been floating around for
centuries, its popularity ebbing and flowing with the passing tide of current
events. While it is still considered by many to be a radical concept,
proponents of a universal basic income (UBI) no longer see it only as a

A German publisher has announced a stop to the sale of books authored by a

received at least €600,000 (£522,000) in undisclosed offshore payments from
companies linked to an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin.

Hubert Seipel, an award-winning film-maker and author, admitted receiving
support for his work on two books charting the Russian leader’s rise to power
and offering portrayals described as sympathetic to him.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.
