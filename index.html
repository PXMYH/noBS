            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Once rare, seven-year car loans are fast becoming the norm. They’re often the
only way buyers can afford new rides, with average sale prices surging 28% in
five years to approach $50,000. Compared to a five-year loan, they can make
the difference between a $1,000 monthly payment and a $780 one. Some buyers
are even going for eight-year loans, although they’re still a tiny fraction of
the market. But they come with steep downsides for buyers and dealers alike. A
long-term loan means the buyer builds equity in the car more slowly, so they
may delay replacing the car, a problem for dealers who need repeat customers.
And when drivers do trade in, they’re more likely to find themselves “upside
down” -- owing more on the loan than the car is now worth. Bloomberg News Auto
Reporter Keith Naughton joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss.

Russian government said on Thursday.

services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”,
including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
