tariff on imports, including autos, and sets up major investment in American
energy and shipbuilding. The agreement, announced by President Donald Trump
and confirmed by officials in Seoul, brings one of the world’s biggest
exporters from a 25% rate just a day before the deadline. The agreement
includes a $350 billion South Korean fund for US investments. President Donald
Trump also said he would impose a tariff of at least 25% on India’s exports to
the US starting Friday, though later added that the two sides were still in
talks. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open

            <p>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says he won’t be cowed by Trump ahead of 50% tariffs
set to hit Brazil

Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has said he does not fear

braces for the introduction of 50% tariffs.

Trump announced plans to slap Brazil with tariffs on 1 August earlier this
month, partly in retaliation for a supposed political “witch-hunt” against his

Investors are weighing Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on 1 August.
The plan so far – levies on Mexican-made cars, steel, aluminum, metal parts
and tomatoes. And they are pondering the push by the Mexican president,

undermine legal certainty and could roll back democratic gains.

            <p>A new analysis suggests Donald Trump&#39;s tariffs could increase factory costs by
2% to 4.5%

As Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his
policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector
that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory
costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%.

“There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris
Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth
who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with
slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages,
if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable.

Global growth will be stronger than previously expected this year after Donald
Trump scaled back his most extreme tariff threats, the International Monetary
Fund said as it upgraded the economic outlook for 2025.

The Washington-based organisation said a “de-escalation in tariffs” by the
White House had spurred a recovery in global trade and a broader economic
expansion, though US policies remain “highly uncertain” and risks to growth
“firmly on the downside”.

  * Business live – latest updates

Uber’s rival taxi operators will not have to pay 20% VAT on their profits
outside London after a UK supreme court verdict in a long-running case.

The court ruled that private-hire operators do not enter into a contract with
passengers, dismissing an Uber appeal. Private-hire firms declared the verdict
to be a “triumph for the sector” after a three-year legal battle, which they
had said could end with fares rising sharply for passengers.

            <p>Plaintiffs argue president lacks legal power to impose duties under the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act

Donald Trump’s strategy of imposing sweeping tariffs on America’s main trading
partners will face a major test in the US courts on Thursday, four days after
the president hailed the “powerful deal” reached with the EU and just hours
before a new round of punishing import duties is set to come into effect.

Americans are getting married, having kids, buying a home, and retiring years
later than what once was the norm. Many don’t ever reach these milestones.

While there is a complex web of factors that go into decisions like having
kids or buying a house, a person’s financial situation often plays an major
role. In a May Harris/Guardian poll, six out of 10 Americans said that the
economy had affected at least one of their major life goals, because of either
a lack of affordability or anxiety about where the economy is heading.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in

week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of

dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
