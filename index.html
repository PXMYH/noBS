            <p>Apple has been fined a whopping €1.8bn by the EU, but it still claims it’s
done nothing wrong. Plus, what happens when open source software gets into the
wrong hands of some crypto fans

 **•Don’t get TechScape delivered to your inbox? Sign up for the full article

The tech industry is one of the most valuable sectors on the planet, but it
ultimately rests on the unpaid labour of an alarmingly small amount of
hobbyists.

That reliance is the blessing, and the curse, of open source software – coding
projects put up on the internet for anyone to use, freely, in their own work.
Some open source software solves simple problems elegantly enough that no one
wants to redo the work unnecessarily; others tackle complex tasks that few
have ever attempted.

 _the most consequential figures in the tech world are half guys like steve
jobs and bill gates and half some guy named ronald who maintains a unix tool
called ‘runk’ which stands for Ronald’s Universal Number Kounter and handles
all math for every machine on earth_

 _A project called tea.xyz promised people they could “get rewards for [their]
open source contributions”, complete with a flashy website describing how it
would “enhance the sustainability of open-source software”._

 _So far, it’s achieved the exact opposite. Promising to reward open source
contributors with crypto tokens, the project asked users to verify their
access to open source projects by merging in a YAML file containing their
crypto wallet address._

 _The fine is nearly four times higher than expected in a move by the European
Commission to show it will act decisively on tech companies who abuse their
dominant position in the market for phones and online services._

 _The European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said a smaller
fine would have been nothing more than the equivalent of “a parking fine” and
was designed to act as “a deterrent” to such practices for Apple and others._

 _If a developer sells physical goods, serves ads in their app, or just shares
an app for free, they don’t pay Apple anything._

 _When it comes to doing business, not everyone’s going to agree on the best
deal. But it sure is hard to beat free. But free isn’t enough for Spotify._

global gender gap was far wider than previously thought.

Closing the gap could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20%,

            <p>Chain of private members’ clubs under pressure as it reports full-year results
this week, with some claiming rapid expansion has robbed it of its exclusivity

There is a Soho House meme account on Instagram with 128,000 followers. Among
its recent posts are ones lampooning the exclusive private members’ club for
supposed frat boy behaviour and a video with the caption: “Love it when £200
leaves my bank account then I’m told to wait four hours for a table at 3pm.”

It has hit a nerve with some members and investors worldwide. “It’s like this
every time, every time I come,” says Zach, an “every house” member, which
means he can access all of the 42 houses across the world for £2,920 a year.
“You can never get a table, it takes ages to get served, and you’re paying a
lot for the privilege of being a member. I don’t really know what the point is
any more. It doesn’t feel special, I don’t feel special.”

Elon Musk is facing a $128m lawsuit from four former Twitter executives who
allege the billionaire tech mogul failed to pay them severance after buying
the social network. The suit, filed on Monday in California, follows a
separate legal complaint last year by rank-and-file employees seeking $500m in
unpaid severance.

“Because Musk decided he didn’t want to pay Plaintiffs’ severance benefits, he

  *  **US markets close at record highs as enthusiasm for AI drives gains**

There seems to be a bizarre disconnect between the surging US stock market and
the sad state of American politics. Winston Churchill supposedly quipped,
“Americans always do the right thing, after they have tried everything else.”
But in light of the impending rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in
this year’s US presidential election, Churchill’s observation needs adjusting:
Americans, apparently, do the right thing only after they have tried
everything else _twice_.

What explains this disconnect between the stock market’s buoyancy and the
crisis facing American democracy? The market may simply believe that the US

The world is off track to meet its climate goals and the public is to blame,
Darren Woods, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, has claimed – prompting
a backlash from climate experts.

As the world’s largest investor-owned oil company, Exxon is among the top
contributors to global planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions. But in an
interview, published on Tuesday, Woods argued that big oil is not primarily
responsible for the climate crisis.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Sixty years after fatal floods and subsidence halted gas extraction in the Po
delta region, politicians are once again eyeing methane reserves. But at what
cost to one of the Mediterranean’s largest wetlands and the people who live
there?

To a visitor driving through Polesine in north-east Italy on a winter morning,
the area might seem blessed with an abundance of wildlife. The biodiversity is
among the richest in Italy, with 400 species of bird, lagoons, marshes and
reed beds that have created a true natural labyrinth. Yet, it soon becomes
obvious that something is not right: houses and fields are all lower than the
road, visibly sunken, protected by embankments about four metres high. The
reason? Without those barriers, they would be under water.

The entire area of Polesine, a strip of land between the Po delta and the
Adriatic Sea, has long suffered the consequences of subsidence, but it was
aggravated by gas extraction, which is why the practice was banned by the
government in 1961.

When City executive Selena* logged on for a Teams call with five senior male
colleagues in spring 2021, she was gobsmacked.

She had spent weeks warning bosses that the London-based investment firm
risked falling foul of European regulations. She had gathered data and
presented supporting evidence, but was repeatedly brushed off. “Nobody wanted
to listen,” she said.

When Ian Harrison returned to the Lincolnshire coast to care for his parents a
decade ago, he didn’t expect to spend his own retirement fighting plans to dig
a £50bn nuclear waste dump near the beaches of his childhood.

Harrison, 67, lives a mile from the village of Theddlethorpe, one of three
sites in England being examined for a possible geological disposal facility
(GDF) to handle decades of nuclear waste from the power and defence

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
