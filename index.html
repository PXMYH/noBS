Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) said they had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator

convicted child sex offender Epstein.

Food delivery companies in Australia have teamed up with the Transport

minimum hourly wage and accident insurance for injuries sustained on the job.

In a deal described as a “world first”, the country’s two largest food

Each day, Kiran Kasbe drives a rickshaw taxi through his home neighbourhood of
Mahul on Mumbai’s eastern seafront, down streets lined with stalls selling
tomatoes, bottle gourds and aubergines–and, frequently, through thick smog.

Earlier this year, doctors found three tumours in his 54-year-old mother’s
brain. It’s not clear exactly what caused her cancer. But people who live near
coal plants are much more likely to develop the illness, studies show, and the
residents of Mahul live a few hundred metres down the road from one.

            <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say
they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their
contacts

Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution
offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant,
ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most
Admired Companies by the magazine, describes its financial advisers as “expert
listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after
goal”.

It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes
it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that
could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file
into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month
internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in
beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent
graduates themselves.

Calling plant-based food veggie “burgers” or “sausages” may be banned in the
UK under the new trade agreement with the EU, the Guardian understands.

The Labour government secured a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) agreement

products including some burgers and sausages in the EU for the first time

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
