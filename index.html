            <p>About 3m households affected because of government missing home energy
efficiency targets, study finds

Millions of households will still be living in fuel poverty by the end of the
decade, and could be forced to pay almost £500 a year extra on their bills
because of the government’s slow progress on meeting its home energy
efficiency targets, according to a study.

to provide convincing restructuring plan

Embattled Chinese development company, Evergrande, has been ordered to
liquidate by a Hong Kong court after an 18-month long hearing.

Evergrande, which holds the ignominious title of the world’s most indebted
property developer with about $300bn in liabilities, failed to convince the
court that it had a viable restructuring plan, after having been given seven
extensions since court proceedings were first brought in June 2022. However it
can still appeal.

heritage. Now the numbers look bad too

Aviation jargon can hide all kinds of horrors. This month Boeing introduced a

            <p>Astronauts content themselves with freeze-dried gruel, but plans for crewed
missions to Mars mean scientists need to create more delicious, nutritious
menus

Three robots are growing vegetables on the roof of the University of
Melbourne’s student pavilion. As I watch, a mechanical arm, hovering above the
crop like a fairground claw machine, sprays a carefully measured dose of water
over the plants.

The greens themselves look fairly terrestrial – cos lettuce, basil, coriander
and moth-eaten kale – but they are actually prototypes for a groundbreaking
research mission to grow fresh food in outer space.

            <p>Thousands of hotel workers in southern California have gone on strike over 100
times since last July, with some still fighting for new union contracts

China’s central bank has announced a surprise cut to the amount of cash that
banks must hold in reserve, hoping to boost the lending available to
households and businesses as policymakers try to steer the economy through a
fragile recovery.

Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), said on
Wednesday that the reserve requirement ratio would be cut by 0.5% from 5
February, the deepest cut to the rate since December 2021. The move will allow
about 1tn yuan (£110.8bn) to be released in the form of new loans.

            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <p>In Solano County, Calif., a who’s who of tech money is trying to build a city

generations don’t want to sell the land.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
