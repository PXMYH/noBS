            <p>Analysis shows funding for biotech, defense and video platform – and a
fascination with The Lord of the Rings

JD Vance’s investments reveal potential contradictions between the political
persona he has sought to project, his history as a venture capitalist and
Peter Thiel acolyte, and his status as a hard-edged tribune of the so-called
“new right”.

Companies he has invested in include a firm that carries out medical testing
of therapies that may include stem cells in scientific research to tech firms
with records of harvesting data. Vance and some of the people behind the
various firms he is involved with also exhibit an obsession with references to
the mythology around The Lord of the Rings’ fantasy world.

Two US astronauts who blasted into space for an eight-day mission in June may
be stuck on the International Space Station until next year if their Boeing
Starliner cannot be repaired for them to return home, Nasa has said.

Nasa officials on Wednesday said astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams,
who became the first crew to fly Boeing’s Starliner capsule, could return on
SpaceX’s Crew Dragon in February 2025 if Starliner is still deemed unsafe to
return to Earth.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The rise of artificial intelligence has sparked a panic about computers
gaining power over humankind. But the real threat comes from falling for the
hype

In Arthur C Clarke’s short story The Nine Billion Names of God, a sect of
monks in Tibet believes humanity has a divinely inspired purpose: inscribing
all the various names of God. Once the list was complete, they thought, he
would bring the universe to an end. Having worked at it by hand for centuries,
the monks decide to employ some modern technology. Two sceptical engineers
arrive in the Himalayas, powerful computers in tow. Instead of 15,000 years to
write out all the permutations of God’s name, the job gets done in three
months. As the engineers ride ponies down the mountainside, Clarke’s tale ends
with one of literature’s most economical final lines: “Overhead, without any
fuss, the stars were going out.”

It is an image of the computer as a shortcut to objectivity or ultimate
meaning – which also happens to be, at least part of, what now animates the
fascination with artificial intelligence. Though the technologies that
underpin AI have existed for some time, it’s only since late 2022, with the
emergence of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, that the technology that approached
intelligence appeared to be much closer. In a 2023 report by Microsoft Canada,
president Chris Barry proclaimed that “the era of AI is here, ushering in a
transformative wave with potential to touch every facet of our lives”, and
that “it is not just a technological advancement; it is a societal shift”.
That is among the more level-headed reactions. Artists and writers are
panicking that they will be made obsolete, governments are scrambling to catch
up and regulate, and academics are debating furiously.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The American economy is still growing. There is no reason to panic, despite
Trump’s ‘world war three’ comments

Two weeks before 19 October 1987, I warned publicly that “in two weeks, the

Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy
at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving
Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good. His newest book,
The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It, is out now. He is a Guardian US
columnist. His newsletter is at robertreich.substack.com

The largest English vineyards increased their revenues by 15% last year, as

While the UK still languishes well down the list of the largest wine-producing
nations, below countries such as Uzbekistan and Tunisia, the industry’s output
has soared in recent years, rising by 77% last year to 161,960 hectolitres,

After years of global growth, the luxury industry is facing a new foe:
“underconsumption”. On TikTok, #underconsumptioncore emerges as a trending
topic, as the next generation of potential shoppers swap tips on how to look
good while buying and spending less. The entire sector is struggling as
consumers wince at luxury prices, and are left bemused by the rapid turnaround
of designers.

Last week, shares in Kering, owner of luxury labels including Gucci,
Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, hit a seven-year low
after reporting that operating income in the second half of the year would be
down 30% after a 42% drop in the first half.

alone.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come here because we are here. This is our island,”
Björklund, a co-owner of a restaurant and distillery on the archipelago, says
she told her friend. Sure enough, she was right.

Ibama environment agency must play a cat and mouse game with the thousands of
illegal miners pouring into Yanomami reserves

In the back yard of the federal police headquarters in Roraima, the
northernmost state of Brazil, giant sacks lie strewn and overflowing with a
jet-black, gravel-like mineral: cassiterite. Although less high-profile than
other items seized during a crackdown on illegal mining in this Amazon state –
including a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter painted in the colours of the Brazilian
flag – cassiterite has become so sought-after that it is nicknamed “black
gold”.

Cassiterite is the chief ore of tin, a less heralded but critical mineral for
the energy transition. It is used in coatings for solar panels, lithium-ion
batteries and solder for electronics, including wind turbines, mobile phones,
computers and industrial alloys.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
