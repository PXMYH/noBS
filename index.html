            <p>Trial judge Arthur Engoron had imposed gag order last month after the former
president maligned a court clerk

A New York appeals court judge on Thursday paused a gag order that barred

trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000
for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post
about a court clerk.

Meta called on US lawmakers on Wednesday to regulate Google and Apple’s app
stores to better protect children, the same day that the Senate began
investigating Meta’s failures to shield children using its platforms.

It Easier, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global head of safety, called for federal
legislation that would mandate app stores to notify parents whenever a child
between the age of 13 and 16 downloads an app, and would solicit the parents’

downloading apps without a parent’s go-ahead.

A German publisher has announced a stop to the sale of books authored by a
leading journalist and Russia expert after an investigation showed he had
received at least €600,000 (£522,000) in undisclosed offshore payments from
companies linked to an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin.

Hubert Seipel, an award-winning film-maker and author, admitted receiving

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced

highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

The UK boss of McDonald’s has told MPs that widespread cases of sexual
harassment and bullying of workers at its fast food shops are “truly horrific”
and that the chain was receiving one to two complaints a week about sexual
harassment.

McDonald’s, which has 1,450 outlets and employs close to 180,000 people in the
UK, most of them young people under 25, is under huge pressure to stamp out
widespread sexual harassment and assault, racism and bullying, after an
investigation by the BBC, which spoke to more than 100 current and recent
McDonald’s workers, some as young as 17.

told the Guardian this week ahead of a Senate hearing on the benefits of
unions.

Sanders is holding a Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee
hearing on Tuesday with US labor leaders on the state of the US labor movement
and efforts to rein in corporate greed in America.

above sea level in the Andean foothills down into the Amazon rainforest.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
