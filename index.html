Boeing is expected to confirm it made less than half of the aircraft of its
rival Airbus in 2024, with analysts questioning whether the troubled US
planemaker will be able to increase its rate of production as planned.

The company is expected to report that it delivered only 340 aircraft to
customers, when it publishes numbers on Tuesday, according to forecasts by
Flight Plan. That is far below the 766 delivered by Airbus, Europe’s
planemaking champion.

            <p>Suzuki chairman who over half a century grew the company into one of the
world’s largest car and motorcycle manufacturers

Osamu Suzuki, who has died aged 94, was one of the global automotive
industry’s longest serving leaders. A director since 1963 of Suzuki, the
motorcycle and small car manufacturer based in Hamamatsu, Japan, he rose
through the ranks to become in 1979 the firm’s president, a position he
relinquished only in 2019 to ascend to the chairmanship. Latterly, as is
customary with elder statemen of Japanese industry, he became an adviser, the
title he still held at the time of his death.

When he first joined Suzuki, in 1958, it had been in the automobile business
for only four years, building the tiny two-cylinder, air-cooled Suzulight car,
in a country that was still finding its way as an industrial power. It had
been founded in 1909 as a loom manufacturer, but the collapse of the cotton
market in the early 1950s galvanised a move towards automotive endeavours.

            <p>‘Now we have to make sure there’s not a second, financial tragedy that follows
the physical catastrophe,’ says consumer advocate

California homeowners who lost everything in this week’s devastating Los
Angeles-area fires now have to battle their insurance companies to recover the

insurance at all.

With estimates of the economic damage from the fires now reaching $52bn-$57bn,
consumer advocates and veterans of past disasters say homeowners can expect

entitled to under their policies.

Steve Bannon, one of the architects of Trumpism, is one the most influential

among the leading figures on the progressive left. In these divided times,
they have found common ground.

As Donald Trump returns to the White House, a bitter row over H-1B visas –
designed to bring skilled foreign workers to the US – has exposed the delicate
threads that tie together his broad coalition – and that of the Democrats.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
