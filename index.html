A New York appeals court judge on Thursday paused a gag order that barred
Donald Trump from commenting on court staffers in his civil fraud trial. The
trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000
for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post
about a court clerk.

In his decision, Judge David Friedman of the state’s intermediate appeals
court cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump’s free speech. He
issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court
staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Meta called on US lawmakers on Wednesday to regulate Google and Apple’s app
stores to better protect children, the same day that the Senate began
investigating Meta’s failures to shield children using its platforms.

In a blogpost titled Parenting in a Digital World Is Hard. Congress Can Make
It Easier, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global head of safety, called for federal
legislation that would mandate app stores to notify parents whenever a child
between the age of 13 and 16 downloads an app, and would solicit the parents’
approval. Children under 13 are already prohibited from creating accounts and
downloading apps without a parent’s go-ahead.

            <p>Artificial intelligence will bring huge changes to the world of work – and
dangers for society. Some think they can be solved by just handing everyone
money. Is there a catch?

The idea of a guaranteed income for all has been floating around for

something had to change and they – not elected officials – would have to make
it happen.

“For [Hurricane] Ida we were ready with showers, mattresses, shelter and food,
but once again the electricity was out so we couldn’t serve our community,”
said Antoine Barriere, a 61-year-old pastor. “The power was the missing piece.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

Successive Conservative chancellors from Rishi Sunak to Jeremy Hunt have

thresholds do not keep up with the rising cost of living, pulling more people
into higher tax brackets.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend

meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
