judge ruled company did not hold social networking monopoly

tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, with the former FTC chair
accusing the company of operating a “buy or bury” scheme against nascent
competitors. The tech giant bought WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014. Losing either

Reyes, filed a federal complaint on Tuesday alleging Reyes and his office
“violated the law to attack a Utah company for political purposes”.

expectations for a US rate cut next month.

Tracking more than 18,500 coins, the value of the crypto market has fallen by

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race
over the economy is costing the US president

Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of
grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living,
propelled by the sharp burst of inflation that peaked at 9% a year in July
2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over
prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the
economy. The other theme was race.

The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing
relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban
America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’
economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came
back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is now trying to recover his
economic narrative. But it may be too late.

industry is the leading cause of deforestation, a new investigation has found.

The number of lobbyists representing the interests of industrial cattle
farming, commodity grains and pesticides is up 14% on last year’s summit in
Baku – and larger than the delegation of the world’s 10th largest economy,
Canada, which brought 220 delegates to Cop30 in Belém, according to the joint

residence to get a better mortgage rate, Donald Trump briefly fired Cook from
her role as a Fed governor and as one of 12 voting members of the Federal

Gen Z is undisciplined, apparently; entitled, some critics claim; and
purportedly hates work. One viral column in the Wall Street Journal went so
far as to suggest this entire generation was potentially “unemployable”.

As younger employees establishing themselves at work continue to face
relentless criticism from the higher rungs of corporate America, those old
enough to remember the arrival of the last generation could be forgiven for
experiencing a sense of deja vu.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>This story of emancipated young women escaping draconian social strictures
brims with enthusiasm and features a cameo from Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Based on a true story, Bill Guttentag’s rousing drama attests to the
resilience of women who dare to dream despite draconian social strictures. The
film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and
businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who
assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The
young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same
zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women
are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their
quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public
scorn from conservatives.

Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
