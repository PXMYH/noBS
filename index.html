            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The emergence of artificial intelligence has pushed the tech sector to all-
time highs, but other assets have risen, too

The US stock market has been on a tear over the past two years. The S&amp;P 500
has increased by roughly 40% since Joe Biden assumed office in January 2021
and, along with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq, is repeatedly setting new records.
Moreover, the dollar has strengthened sharply against every major currency,
while the price of gold soared to an all-time record of $2,470 an ounce
earlier this month.

Economists and commentators have struggled to explain these trends. While the
increase in gold prices could be attributed to elevated risk perceptions
stemming from political and geopolitical uncertainties, this explanation does
not account for the booming stock market. Conversely, the decline in the Vix
volatility index since 2022 might explain the US stock market rally but not
the increase in gold prices.

A Brazilian cattle rancher has been ordered to pay more than $50m (£39m) for
destroying part of the Amazon rainforest and ordered to restore the precious
carbon sink.

Last week, a federal court in Brazil froze the assets of Dirceu Kruger to pay
compensation for the damage he had caused to the climate through illegal
deforestation. The case was brought by Brazil’s attorney general’s office,
representing the Brazilian institute of environment and renewable natural
resources (Ibama). It is the largest civil case brought for climate crimes in
Brazil to date and the start of a legal push to repair and deter damage to the
rainforest.

To witness how the United States has become the world’s unchallenged oil and
gas behemoth is to contemplate the scene from John Allaire’s home, situated on
a small spit of coastal land on the fraying, pancake-flat western flank of
Louisiana.

Allaire’s looming neighbor, barely a mile east across a ship channel that has
been pushed into the Gulf of Mexico, is a hulking liquified natural gas (or
LNG) plant, served by leviathan ships shuttling its chilled cargo overseas.
Another such terminal lies a few miles to the west, yet another to the north.
The theme continues even in Allaire’s seaward vista – alongside a boneyard of
old oil rigs, a new floating offshore LNG platform is in the works.

While there are few phones in the market that will be affected, business

When Kenzi, an advertising worker in Shanghai, bought an electric vehicle in
November she wasn’t even thinking about the environmental benefits. She had
read Elon Musk’s biography and thought the Tesla 3 looked good. She also knew
that if she bought an EV she could bypass the long wait and cost of getting
licence plates, which are rationed by the government.

“It’s not easy to get a licence plate in Shanghai, but you get a licence for
free when you buy an EV,” she said.

            <p>It’s not that the outfits are necessarily bad, although many of them are. Have
we lost something in the transition away from the coat-and-tie?

The business casual revolution of the 1990s and rise of tech billionaires in
the early aughts supposedly ushered in a new era that freed employees from the
shackles of dress codes. Mark Zuckerberg turned hoodies and jeans into a
symbol of New Economy meritocracy, the uniform of whiz kid hackers shaking up

employees to wear whatever they wanted as they jumped around in colorful ball

Mirrortocracy, we simply traded our hard-written dress codes for softly coded
dress norms. The new world is actually not so free. The cognitive dissonance
is plain to see on the faces of recruiters who pretend clothing is no big
deal, but are clearly disappointed if you show up to a job interview in a dark
worsted business suit. “You are expected to conform to the rules of The
Culture before you are allowed to demonstrate your actual worth,” wrote Bueno.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
