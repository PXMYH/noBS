Ghosts and goblins might not be the only scary things popping up this
Halloween. Prices for the holiday’s most popular candy treats are rising,
spooked by Donald Trump’s tariffs and climate change.

Candy prices are estimated to increase by 10.8% this year, according to new
analysis from progressive groups the Century Foundation and the Groundwork
Collaborative, with some popular chocolate-based treats seeing price upticks
of at least 20%. The price increases could mean popular candy like Tootsie
Rolls and Hershey’s chocolate and variety packs are a few dollars more
expensive than just a year ago.

            <p>Food stamps are in danger and hundreds of thousands of federal workers may go
unpaid, as thousands more are laid off

For many Americans, government shutdowns are a painful experience, but in the
current shutdown, Donald Trump – that supposed champion of workers – has gone
out of his way to make things more painful for millions of workers and their
families.

As part of his effort to clobber the Democrats in the shutdown showdown, the
US president has repeatedly treated workers like pawns by employing a callous
calculus that the worse he makes things for workers, the greater the pressure
on congressional Democrats to cry uncle and end the shutdown on his terms. Not
only are several of Trump’s shutdown moves blatantly anti-worker, but legal
experts say many of them violate federal law.

Donald Trump has described crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in
South Korea as “amazing”, saying their dispute over the supply of rare earths
had been settled and that he would visit China in April.

Xi Jinping has not commented on Thursday’s discussions but noted that the
economic and trade teams from both countries had “reached a basic consensus on
addressing our respective major concerns” during recent talks in Kuala Lumpur,
according to Chinese state media. That had “provided the necessary conditions”
for their meeting on Thursday, he added.

  * Business live – latest updates

Boeing pushed the first delivery of its long-delayed 777X jet program out to
2027 and took a nearly $5bn charge due to the delays, in another series of
setbacks for the aerospace giant.

The 777X was central to Boeing’s long-term widebody strategy, previously
dominated by its 747 and 777 jets. But repeated certification and production
delays have pushed back deliveries by years, piling up charges of more than
$15bn and straining its finances, while giving an opening to rival Airbus’s
competing A350 as international travel continues to rise.

School, she was working in a career she had long dreamed of. Her husband,
stepchild and baby lived in New York City and the two-hour commute to
Philadelphia was inconvenient but sustainable. She was embarking on a journey

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
