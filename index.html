            <p>Number of vessels scheduled to arrive at Port of Los Angeles next week is down
by almost a third year on year

  * Business live – latest updates

Donald Trump’s increasingly erratic trade war has triggered a slump in
shipments to the US’s most important ports, amid the growing risk of a
recession in the world’s largest economy.

In the latest sign of the US president’s tariff policies rattling the economy,
figures show the number of vessels scheduled to arrive at the Port of Los
Angeles next week is down by almost a third on the same period a year earlier.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In Kansas, Panasonic and two community colleges scaled up training fast. But
jobs in the EV industry could be affected by Trump’s war on clean energy

In a Kansas City classroom, 20 students were learning how basic circuit boards
work. They fiddled with knobs, switches, levers and wires; if they got the
connections right, tiny light bulbs glowed.

The students, recruited for the opportunity by Panasonic, were participants in
an eight-week apprenticeship course that involved classes at the community
college and on-the-job training. When they’re done, they will be among the
first workers at the company’s new electric vehicle battery factory in nearby
De Soto, Kansas. The $4bn manufacturing plant – touted as the largest EV
battery factory in the world – is expected to open in early summer and
eventually employ roughly 4,000 people. Panasonic also paid for the students’
tuition, as well as the instructor’s salary.

            <p>Filming in Los Angeles is at a historic low, with some suggesting the city
might go the way of Detroit

When screenwriter David Scarpa visits the great Hollywood studios these days,
he is struck by what is missing. “It used to be you’d walk around those back
lots and you’d see many people and they were very busy,” Scarpa muses. “They
were like small cities. Now often you’ll walk around and have nobody else
there. It feels empty. You definitely feel the absence of life on those lots.”

Like the once proud industrial factories of the midwest, the dream factories
of southern California are in decline. Last year was the worst for on-location

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
