Dublin, Church Lane and Sage in County Cork, and Barnacles in Galway.

These are just some of the most recent additions to the list of more than 600
restaurants that have been forced to close in Ireland in the last year in what
is being seen as a growing crisis for the country’s high street and tourist

From the north, motorists pull into Scranton via the Joseph R Biden Jr
Expressway. Cutting through the scenic Pocono Mountains, now at the start of
autumn color season, they are greeted with a towering, electric billboard,
blaring an encapsulating – if divisive – message to this working-class town:
“Democrats for Trump,” it reads. “Economy,” it continues, with a green checked
box next to the word.

The sign in Biden’s hometown is the perfect fall 2024 welcome mat in this
crucial swing state filled with voters whose economic anxiety or satisfaction
will decide next month’s election.

she would be unwise to do it at the expense of the poorest

There is a danger that Labour will suffer the Macron effect when the budget is
unveiled at the end of the month. Emmanuel Macron, who was first elected
president of France in 2017, put business investment and building a culture of
entrepreneurialism at the top of his to-do list – only to be condemned later
as a friend of the rich.

Rachel Reeves speaks a similar language when she says economic growth is her
priority and that business people should be offered more support than even the
Tories were prepared to countenance.

been a few huge market crashes but we always recover. This time, it’s a real
decline.”

Drive along the granite city’s Union Street and there are dozens of shuttered
shops, some empty for almost a decade following one of the longest routs in
the history of the oil market, which brought oil prices to lows of less than
$30 (£23) a barrel in 2016, less than half its value today.

            <p>The billionaire also answers questions on AI, taxes and a world of memes

As the US presidential election looms, the billionaire Mark Cuban has emerged
as an energetic campaign surrogate for Kamala Harris. Making the case for
business leaders to support the Democrat over Donald Trump, Cuban has drawn on
his experience (in tech, investments, healthcare and now sports, as minority
owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA team), celebrity (as a lead “shark” for 15
seasons of ABC’s Shark Tank) and willingness to confront Trump-supporting
billionaires, Elon Musk prominent among them.

The road has not been smooth. Last week, Cuban clashed with congressional
progressives after criticizing Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade
Commission, over her tech-sector antitrust work. That issue and others,
including Cuban’s thoughts on Trump’s championing of tariffs and the perennial
question of whether Cuban harbors presidential ambitions of his own, are
addressed below, in emailed answers to 10 questions posed by Guardian writers
and editors.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
