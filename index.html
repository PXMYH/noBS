Food industry trade bodies are discussing whether to take legal action against
the government over post-Brexit plans that will require all meat and dairy
products sold in the UK to be labelled as “not for EU”.

Food producers say the labelling could add £250m a year to their costs,
further fuelling inflation, and they are discussing a legal challenge as a
viable option if a solution with the government is not found.

Oprah Winfrey announced she was leaving WeightWatchers on Thursday and giving
away all her stock – a move that follows the TV talk queen revealing that her
recent dramatic weight loss was due to taking new weight-loss drugs.

A statement from Winfrey issued by the company said that the talkshow host, a
public face for WeightWatchers since 2015, would donate all her shares in the
company to the National Museum of African American History and Culture “to
eliminate any perceived conflict of interest around her taking weight-loss
medications”.

It’s a leap year once again which means workers are doing a 366-day year. So
what does it mean for Americans’ pay?

If you’re an hourly worker, the answer is straightforward, says Leticia
Saucedo, the Martin Luther King Jr professor of law at the University of
California, Davis: you’re certainly entitled to pay. And hours worked on the
29th aren’t considered overtime – “it’s just another workday”, says Reuel

climate goals, including a plan to reach net zero carbon neutral standards by
2040.

Letitia James, the New York attorney general, filed the suit alleging that JBS

– or cause mass misery. The choice is ours

As artificial intelligence spreads rapidly across America’s economy, there’s a
lively debate about how it will transform the future of work. What many people
fail to realize is that AI has already changed millions of workers’ jobs –
often for the worse.

At Amazon, some warehouse and delivery drivers complain that AI-driven bots
have fired them without any human intervention whatsoever. At some companies,
surveillance apps track how much time workers spend in trips to the bathroom,
with some workers protesting that the time limits are too strict.

Tech companies say new Australian safety standards will inadvertently make it
harder for generative AI systems to detect and prevent online child abuse and
pro-terrorism material.

Under two mandatory standards aimed at child safety released in draft form by
the regulator last year, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, proposed
providers detect and remove child-abuse material and pro-terrorism material
“where technically feasible”, as well as disrupt and deter new material of
that nature.

  * Photographs by Marco Massa and Haakon Sand

For most of winter and spring in 2022, Luigi Ferraris, a 58-year-old rice
farmer from Mortara, a town in the Po valley, remained hopeful. Rainfall had
been down 40% in the first six months of the year, and snow had accumulated
thinly in the Alps, prompting an 88% drop in the amount of water coming to the
Po River from snow-melt; flow in the river and its connected canals was at a
historic low.

But Ferraris believed things would soon return to normal. “I thought the lack
of water would be temporary,” he says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Diversity-focused groups outline concerns in letter to Fortune 500 companies
amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
