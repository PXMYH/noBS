            <p>After 100 days as FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary lays out his vision for
reform, starting with the broken systems he’s uncovered inside the agency. He
confronts the FDA’s failure in the opioid crisis, acknowledges the loss of
public trust during COVID, and calls out regulatory capture and internal
conflicts of interest, including practices that allowed FDA staff to block
their own drug safety reviews. Makary announces a new policy to publish drug
rejection letters and introduces a priority review voucher program to fast-
track approvals for companies that align with U.S. public health goals,
including lowering drug prices to match those in other wealthy nations. “This
president,” he says, “does not like to see Americans getting ripped off.” He
also pledges to modernize food chemical oversight, reform the outdated GRAS
system, and cut bureaucratic bloat to refocus the FDA on science, safety, and
common sense. (Source: Bloomberg)

ITV and Disney have struck a deal to show programmes such as The Bear and Love
Island on each other’s video platforms, the first such deal in the UK and the
latest sign of the changing content relationship developing between British
broadcasters and US streamers.

Under the deal, ITV will begin showing the first seasons of some of Disney’s
hit programmes – including the hit chef drama, the Star Wars spin-off Andor,
Only Murders in the Building and reality shows such as The Kardashians - free

            <p>Ex-NBC executive was tasked with building an ‘everything app’, but billionaire
owner was biggest obstacle in her path

In May 2023, when Linda Yaccarino, an NBC advertising executive, joined what
was then still known as Twitter, she was given a tall order: repair the
company’s relationship with advertisers after a chaotic year of being owned by
Elon Musk. But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted an antisemitic
tweet that drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal,
Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the
platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference –
which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to
advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger: “Go fuck yourselves.”
Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.

“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail
me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said.
“Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Social housing makes up almost half of the city’s 1m homes. The system isn’t
perfect, but it gets a lot of things right

When it comes to best-practice examples in the housing debate, Vienna is a
common reference. Indeed, the Austrian capital features prominently in
narratives about successful housing policies. An article in the Observer
concluded that Vienna shows “decent homes for all” is not an impossible dream.
And the New York Times even declared it “a renters’ utopia”.

A considerable part of the attraction of Vienna relates to its large social-
housing stock. It accounts for some 43% of the roughly 1m housing units in the
city. About half of it is municipally owned council housing. The other half is
provided and administered by limited-profit housing associations – an Austrian
version of social housing providers that are permitted to make a small profit
to finance their operations. Social housing is not just for those on low
incomes, but also caters to middle- and even some upper-middle-class
households.

British pubs will close down at the rate of one a day this year, the
industry’s trade body has warned, blaming high business taxes. At the same
time, the hospitality sector has called on ministers to tackle “eye-watering”
costs.

The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents more than 20,000
pubs in the UK, said it expects 378 to close this year in England, Scotland
and Wales, at a cost of 5,600 jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Climate change, development, labor shortages and tariffs are making life the
pits for the state’s cherry farmers

Nearly 100 years ago, north-west Michigan cherry farmers and Traverse City
community leaders started a festival to promote the city and their region’s
tart cherry crop as a tourist destination.

Now known as the “cherry capital of the world”, Traverse City’s National
Cherry Festival draws 500,000 visitors over eight days to this picturesque
Lake Michigan beach town to enjoy carnival rides and airshows, and to eat
cherries. It also sparked a thriving agrotourism industry amid its rolling
hills that now boasts dozens of shops, wineries, U-pick orchards, and farm-to-
table restaurants helmed by James Beard-award-winning chefs.

            <p>Amy Hawkins visits one of the many bars popping up across Chinese cities
offering drinks, snacks and a vision of the future

In the age of self-help, self-improvement and self-obsession, there have never
been more places to look to for guidance. Where the anxious and the uncertain
might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in a
seemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT. Or, if you’re
in China, DeepSeek.

To some, though, it feels as if our ancestors knew more about life than we do.
Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young
Chinese are turning to ancient forms of divination to find out what the future
holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up
in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongside _xuanxue_ _,_ or
spiritualism. The trend makes sense: China’s economy is struggling, and
although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper
than other forms of retail therapy or an actual therapist. With a deep-rooted
culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which
have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious
beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.

When Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described socialist, won New York’s
mayoral Democratic nomination last week over a seasoned but scandal-scarred
veteran, the city’s financial elite had a meltdown.

This was the start of “hot commie summer” in the city, New York hedgevfund
billionaire Daniel Loeb posted to X. John Catsimatidis, billionaire CEO of
grocery chain Gristedes and friend of Donald Trump, warned on Fox Business:
“If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell,

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
