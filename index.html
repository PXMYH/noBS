            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Bitcoin has tumbled below $90,000 to hit the lowest since mid-November, as
rising volatility hits crypto market

  *  **Full story:Tesla sales almost halve in Europe as Musk faces criticism over Trump ties**

 **Several UK charities are warning that this morning’s rise in the energy
price cap (which covers England, Wales and Scotland) will hurt struggling
householdss**

The Centre for Ageing Better is concerned that millions of older people
already struggling on low incomes will be put into even greater difficulty
with increasing energy costs, having already lost their winter fuel payments
last year.

“It is so dispiriting to learn that bill payers must brace for another
substantial increase to energy prices from April. For those living on the
breadline, desperately struggling to meet the basic costs of everyday living,
this will be heartbreaking news.

There are millions of older people who no longer qualify for winter fuel
payments who live on paltry incomes that do not even cover the basics of a
dignified life. They simply will not be able to afford higher energy prices
and will cut back usage further, at significant risk to their own health.

“Today’s price cap announcement is more bad news for the older people in
poverty that have already been subjected to a brutally long and cold winter.
We now know that energy prices will rise again by 6%, from an average of
£1,738 to £1,849. People in later life on low fixed incomes have stretched
their budgets to breaking point during the colder months, and many tell us
they don’t have enough money to turn the heating on full stop. Now, their
bills rise yet again to amounts they simply cannot afford.

“History cannot be allowed to repeat itself next winter. The UK Government
needs to put in place plans that support older people in financial hardship to
turn their heating on. Since the changes to Winter Fuel Payment were made in
July, our helpline has seen a massive increase in calls regarding the payment,
and many of the people we have spoken to have made drastic cutbacks, such as
only living in one room and cutting down on food.

“We’re particularly concerned about households with children, where over one
in three struggle to afford bills, rising to more than half of those on low
incomes.

“The government can’t let another winter go by without targeted support for
those most in need, and there is a way of paying for this. Our recent analysis
found energy network companies made billions in excess profits while
households have faced soaring bills, and it’s only right this money be used to
help fund better targeted bill support and much-needed debt relief.”

“There is a sense of déjà vu in the energy market as we watch the price cap
rise for a third consecutive time, with the volatile international wholesale
market once again the main culprit. Households have been promised falls in
bills, and many will be understandably irritated with what they may see as a
failure of government energy policy. However, the reality is, our gas-led
wholesale power market and reliance on international imports limits the impact
of what any government policy can have - at least in the short-term - there is
only so much you can do when prices are rising across the world.

“That’s not to say the government and the regulator are without options to
help lower consumer bills. Ofgem has ongoing consultations looking at the non-
wholesale costs included in the cap, and of course the government has levers
it can pull from social tariffs to support payments.

Beijing’s technological prowess. Meanwhile Bitcoin tumbled below $90,000 to

Trump’s election to the White House reverses under the weight of his trade
tariffs and a string of industry setbacks. Today&#39;s guests: Christian Mueller-

            <p>Democrats in Nevada push bill that would provide further relief for tipped
workers who can be paid as little as $2.13

Donald Trump began the second term of his presidency last month with a victory
lap at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, a key swing state he flipped in 2024, by
reaffirming his campaign promise to pass a proposal to abolish taxes on tips.

Nearly 6 million workers around the US rely on tips for most of their income.
Under federal law, tipped workers can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour, a
minimum that has not changed since 1991. Only seven states, Alaska,

sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.

Trump ally digs in and threatens job losses

The US government’s human resources office has walked back an ultimatum issued
by Elon Musk that would have forced its workers to resign if they did not
submit a bullet-point list of their recent accomplishments, in one of the
first signs of internal pushback to the Tesla billionaire’s campaign to

            <p>As the invasion enters its fourth year, analysts are examining the health of

conflict ends. The answers are not as predictable as one might think

As Ukrainians prepare to enter their fourth year dealing with the harsh daily
realities of life during conflict with Russia, few will be musing on the
comparative economic health of the warring nations. However, inflation figures
released either side of the border showed the continued toll the conflict has
had on citizens of both countries – with price rises running at 9.5% in Russia
and 12% in Ukraine.

examining the relative health of each country.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>An explosive succession trial and an astonishing interview with one of
Rupert’s sons have exposed the paranoia and hatred at the heart of global
media’s most powerful family. This could get messy…

When some of the mind games and manoeuvres that turned a Murdoch family
“retreat” into an ordeal appeared in _Succession_, the TV drama about
squabbling family members of a right-wing media company, members of the real-
life family started to suspect each other of leaking details to the writers.
The truth was more straightforward. _Succession_ ’s creator, Jesse Armstrong,
said that his team hadn’t needed inside sources – they had simply read press
reports.

            <p>Bruce and Nancy Steele had a business that produced honey for the past 30
years before the Eaton fire destroyed it

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the
California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert:
watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures
included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <p>The cost of energy is rising for UK households, with regulator Ofgem
increasing the limit on how much it allows suppliers to charge. High energy
prices were a big talking point during the 2024 UK election campaign. The
winner, Labour, promised to lower bills with a plan to get more energy from
homegrown, renewable sources. That policy is unlikely to have much impact
before 2030 at the earliest. Meanwhile, the government is facing calls from

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
