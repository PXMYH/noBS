Axel Springer has struck a €13.5bn (£11.3bn) deal that will see its media
assets, which include Politico, Business Insider and newspapers Bild and Die
Welt, hived off into a private company with the aim of building an
international digital news media powerhouse.

The move will see the German conglomerate, which last year decided against
bidding for the Daily and Sunday Telegraph because its focus is a “digital
first, digital only” acquisition strategy, become fully privately owned for
the first time since its flotation in 1985.

Europe’s car industry has called for the relaxation of EU emissions targets
after sales of electric cars stalled further in August, adding to growing
political pressure that threatens to slow the transition away from fossil
fuels.

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), a lobby group, said
that its members could face “multibillion-euro fines” because the shift to
electric production has not been quick enough to meet the EU targets.

            <p>Kahawa 1893 prioritizes small producers and premium beans, while also offering
consumers a ‘virtual pot’ to support its suppliers

When she was a child growing up in Kenya, Margaret Nyamumbo learned about a
custom that took place on her grandfather’s coffee farm: every few weeks, the
women who worked there would gather around a table and drop money into a large
pot. Anyone who had contributed had the right to later retrieve funds in the
form of a small loan.

This so-called “table banking” system, which is a custom in Kenya, helped
women involved in the coffee trade support one another. Kenyan women, who
historically are denied land ownership and therefore the ability to take out
loans, provide 90% of labor on coffee farms but own just 1% of the land.

The Teamsters International, a powerful US transportation workers union that
represents over 1.3 million workers, declined to endorse a candidate ahead of
November’s presidential election – but released data suggesting most of its
members backed Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.

Polling conducted before Joe Biden, who in 2023 became the first sitting
president to join a picket line, dropped out of the race, showed that the
union’s members preferred Biden to Trump, 44.3% to 36.3%, according to the
Union.

  * Federal Reserve cuts US interest rates for the first time in four years

The Federal Reserve announced a half-percentage point interest-rate cut on
Wednesday, the first decrease in four years. It’s a moment that many

The American diner brand could disappear from UK high streets after Hostmore,

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
