of US president’s tariffs stoking inflation

Stephen Miran, Donald Trump’s new appointee on the Federal Reserve’s interest-
rate-setting board, has doubled down on his calls for the central bank to more
aggressively cut interest rates.

Last week, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point, bringing rates down

Nvidia, the chipmaking company, will invest up to $100bn in OpenAI and provide

will involve two separate but intertwined transactions, according to a person
close to OpenAI. The startup will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia
will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares, the person said.

A top donor to Donald Trump and other Maga Republicans has privately mocked
the US president’s longtime position that he has an upper hand in trade
negotiations with China, in a sign that even some loyal supporters have been
uneasy with the White House strategy.

Liz Uihlein, the billionaire businesswoman who co-founded the office supply
company Uline with her husband, Richard, sent an email to her staff earlier
this year that contained a cartoon in which Trump can be seen playing cards
with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. In the cartoon, Trump claims: “I hold
the cards”, to which Xi responds: “The cards are made in China.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The president’s claim that undermining his tariffs would ‘literally destroy’
the country gets the situation backwards

Just hours after an appeals court ruled that it was illegal for Donald Trump
to impose his unpopular across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries, he
posted a frantic, over-the-top rant that declared: “If allowed to stand, this
Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”

So here the president of the United States was asserting that if the courts
torpedoed his tariffs, then the US, the most powerful nation on earth, would
be destroyed, would “literally” be kaput. Trump seemed to suggest that court
rulings that blocked his beloved tariffs would have the destructive power of,
say, 100 hydrogen bombs.

workplace, as well as economic and legal issues

UK government borrowing rose to a five-year high in August, official figures

autumn budget.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net
borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – rose to £18bn
in August, £3.5bn more than in the same month a year earlier.

The Mickey Mouse logo is all over Walt Disney’s headquarters in Burbank,
California. But on Thursday, those famous ears were also on display outside
the studio on protest signs, including one labeling Disney executives as
“cowards” for suspending Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow in response to
pressure from the Trump administration.

Disney, which owns ABC, “indefinitely” suspended Kimmel’s show on Wednesday
night, following threatening remarks by Trump’s Federal Communications
Commission chair, Brendan Carr, about possible regulatory consequences for
comments Kimmel made about Trump and the Maga movement’s response to Charlie
Kirk’s killing.

The value of the drugmaker Novo Nordisk jumped by about £9bn on Thursday after
research showed that taking its new anti-obesity pill can result in almost as
much weight loss as its Wegovy jab.

The Danish company is racing against its US rival Eli Lilly to get a tablet
treatment to market. Shares in Novo Nordisk climbed by more than 6% on hopes

opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
