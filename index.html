Donald Trump halted a key part of his tariff attack on China on Friday, as he
threatened to impose new US duties on goods from many more countries next
week.

Plans to ensure shipments from China to the US worth less than $800 still face
tariffs – removing the longstanding duty-free status of low-cast packages –
have been delayed to give more time to federal agencies to prepare for the

The Trump administration has ordered US states to suspend a $5bn electric
vehicle charging station program in a further blow to the environmental
movement since the president’s return to the White House.

In a memo issued on Thursday to state transportation directors, the
transportation department’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ordered
states not to spend any funds allocated to them under the Biden administration
as part of the national electric vehicle infrastructure (NEVI) program.

coin immediately before his second inauguration in January.

Now an army of digital imposters is trying to cash in on the president’s name

Donald Trump postponed his threat to tax all imports from Mexico and Canada
this week, citing action by those countries against migration and drug
smuggling; but it was telling that tariffs on China went ahead.

When it comes to the US’s neighbours, Trump’s Treasury secretary, the hedge
fund manager Scott Bessent, made clear in a Fox News interview that tariffs
are essentially a negotiating tool – partly aimed at achieving non-economic
goals.

next for the Utah-based festival

At the end of last year’s Sundance film festival there may have been some
concerns over the quality of films, but there was less worry over the quantity
of deals. As I wrote last year’s wrap, there had already been major big-money
sales – $10m for A Real Pain, $17m for It’s What’s Inside, $15m for My Old
Ass, $5m for Presence – some smaller ones – Thelma, Ghostlight, Ibelin,
Daughters, Skywalkers and Kneecap – and in the 48 hours after there were even
more – Dìdi to Focus and Will &amp; Harper to Netflix. Post-strikes it was a
reassuringly robust marketplace with gaps that needed to be filled but just a
year later, things are looking far less comforting.

There were even more questions over quality – I heard many a grumble in the
press line over a lack of breakouts – but even so, as of writing, there have
been only four deals confirmed, a worryingly dour result for what’s seen as
one of America’s most important markets. Films with sellable names like
Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch and Josh O’Connor and some
of the best-reviewed titles remain without distribution.

One of the world’s most celebrated financiers, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, has
been accused of exploiting his position at the storied bank to abuse women who
worked with him.

The claims against De Rothschild, two years after his death, come from several
women who said they felt unable to raise their concerns while he was still
alive, because of his position within the bank and the British establishment.
They spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity.

  * Opinion: New British Virgin Islands measures don’t protect businesses or privacy – they protect criminals

The British Virgin Islands (BVI) have been accused of a “shameful” attempt to
avoid a crackdown on financial crime, in a growing rift with the government
that threatens to escalate into a constitutional standoff.

MPs have written to the premier of the BVI, while the former development
minister Andrew Mitchell fired a broadside at the islands’ leadership, over
their proposals for a new register of who owns companies registered on the
islands.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
