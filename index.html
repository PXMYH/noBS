            <p>Despite surpassing Wall Street expectations for its AI chips, company shares
drop 2.3% in after hours trading

Chipmaker Nvidia set a fresh sales record in the second quarter, surpassing
Wall Street expectations for its artificial intelligence chips. But shares of
the chip giant still dropped 2.3% in after hours trading, in a sign that
investors’ worries of an AI bubble and the repercussions of Donald Trump’s
trade wars are not quelled.

Nvidia’s financial report was the first test of investor appetite since last
week’s mass AI-stock selloff, when several tech stocks saw shares tumble last
week amid growing questions over whether AI-driven companies are being
overvalued.

            <p>New lawsuit aimed at Amazon questions the legitimacy of the word ‘buy’ when it
comes to owning a movie on your devices

A possible class-action lawsuit against Amazon Prime, one of the world’s
biggest platforms for streaming film and television, has raised an odd
question: what does it mean to _buy_ something?

The proposed lawsuit, which was filed last week in federal court and first
reported by the Hollywood Reporter, alleges that Prime’s practice of offering
users the chance to “buy” (as opposed to “rent”) content is inherently
deceptive. The suit argues that buying something implies perpetual possession
– but that Amazon, like many other streaming services, is really just selling
its customers viewing licenses that can be revoked at any time, in keeping
with fine print that most customers do not read or understand.

Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve’s board of

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
