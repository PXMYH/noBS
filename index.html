Oil prices are expected to rise as the trading week starts, after the US
attack on Iran stoked fears of an escalating regional conflict that could shut
down the vital strait of Hormuz shipping route.

A barrel of Brent crude was selling for about $77 on Friday, having risen by

prompted missile strikes from Tehran against Tel Aviv.

Small businesses in the US account for approximately half of the country’s
jobs, so when small businesses are doing well, it’s likely that the economy is
doing well. Media reports recently indicated that many small businesses are
challenged by Trump’s tariffs, ongoing inflation, labor shortages and higher
financing costs. So how are small businesses doing so far in 2025? Not great.
But not that bad either.

In just the past two months, there have been no less than seven comprehensive

Dr Eric Horvitz, a former technology adviser to Joe Biden, said bans on

Fossil fuel companies are able to challenge California’s ability to set
stricter standards reducing the amount of polluting coming from cars, the US
supreme court has ruled in a case that is set to unravel one of the key tools
used to curb planet-heating emissions in recent years.

The conservative-dominated supreme court voted by seven to two to back a
challenge by oil and gas companies, along with 17 Republican-led states, to a
waiver that California has received periodically from the federal government
since 1967 that allows it to set tougher standards than national rules
limiting pollution from cars. The state has separately stipulated that only
zero-emission cars will be able to sold there by 2035.

The owners of James Bond have called the attempt by an Austrian businessman to

on the multibillion-pound global franchise.

In February, the Guardian revealed that a Dubai-based property developer had
filed claims in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various
protections had lapsed around James Bond’s intellectual property, including
his name, his 007 assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”.

Developing countries need a fresh round of debt relief, to prevent money

according to a major new report commissioned by the late Pope Francis.

The Jubilee report, produced by a panel of experts chaired by Nobel prize-

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.
