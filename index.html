Donald Trump is not making America feel great again.

Nine months into the second Trump administration, Americans are feeling pretty
crummy. More than half – 53% – believe the economy is worsening, according to
the latest survey conducted by Harris for the Guardian. That’s just slightly
better than the 58% who thought it was going downhill in late April, when
financial markets were still reeling from the president’s “liberation day”
tariffs. About 60% think the cost of living has gotten worse since the start
of the year; 47% say the job market is worse.

  * Analysis: Americans’ pessimism about the economy cuts across political lines

Nine months after Donald Trump took office, promising to reduce prices on “day
one”, a clear majority of Americans say their monthly costs have risen by
between $100 and $749, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the
Guardian.

The president has continued to insist that there is “virtually no inflation”.
“Prices are ‘WAY DOWN’ in the USA,” Trump wrote on social media in late
August.

The Trump administration has criticised China’s increased restrictions on rare
earth exports as a threat to global supply chains, and said it would seek to
tighten control over strategic sectors by taking more stakes in key companies
to counter Beijing.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told an event on Wednesday that China’s
dramatic new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets demonstrated the
need for the US to be self-sufficient in critical materials or rely more on
trusted allies.

planet-heating pollution than official figures show, a report has found.

The cars, which can run on electric batteries as well as combustion engines,

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Deportations are likely to cause employers to let go of US workers, and reduce
the labor force

The government shutdown may have prevented the publication of September’s job
report, but we can be reasonably confident that when the numbers are known,
they will further underscore the Trump administration’s policy incoherence and
remind us of all of the damage he is prepared to inflict on the American
economy.

The president will most likely be apoplectic over data confirming that the
economy is generating very few new jobs (the payroll processor ADP estimated a
loss of 32,000 private sector jobs in September). Trump fired the head of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs numbers, after a
lackluster report published in August.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
