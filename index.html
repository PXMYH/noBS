Twenty years ago this weekend, the leaders of the world’s most powerful
countries, chaired by Tony Blair, gathered at the Scottish golf resort of
Gleneagles and made a series of historic promises on debt relief and overseas
aid.

It was the culmination of a long-running campaign involving charities,
churches and celebrities and benefited from the passionate commitment of
Gordon Brown, for whom international development is a lifelong cause.

            <p>US is on the brink of launching a trade assault on dozens of countries as
90-day pause on tariffs is set to end on 9 July

When Donald Trump unveiled his “liberation day” tariffs in the spring, only to
pull the plug days later as panic tore through global markets, his officials
scrambled to present the climbdown as temporary.

Three months of frenetic talks would enable the Trump administration to strike
dozens of trade agreements with countries across the world, they claimed.
“We’re going to run,” the White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox
Business Network. “Ninety deals in 90 days is possible.”

            <p>Amy Hawkins visits one of the many bars popping up across Chinese cities
offering drinks, snacks and a vision of the future

In the age of self-help, self-improvement and self-obsession, there have never
been more places to look to for guidance. Where the anxious and the uncertain
might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in a
seemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT. Or, if you’re
in China, DeepSeek.

To some, though, it feels as if our ancestors knew more about life than we do.
Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young
Chinese are turning to ancient forms of divination to find out what the future
holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up
in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongside _xuanxue_ _,_ or
spiritualism. The trend makes sense: China’s economy is struggling, and
although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper
than other forms of retail therapy or an actual therapist. With a deep-rooted
culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which
have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious
beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.

The US economy added 147,000 jobs in June, a sign of continuing strength in
the labor market amid Donald Trump’s trade war.

The number of jobs added surpassed expectations, as economists largely
anticipated a drop in openings. Instead, **3** ,000 more jobs were added in
June compared with May, according to new job figures from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS). The unemployment rate actually decreased to 4.1%, down from
4.2% in May.

Last November, Donald Trump made a solemn vow to all Americans: “Every
citizen, I will fight for you, your family and your future every single day.”
Eight months later, Trump is vigorously backing many policies that will mean
pain for millions.

Trump has pushed to enact the Republican budget bill, which would make
significant cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance, and would do the
greatest damage to those Americans struggling hardest to make ends meet – the
30% of the US population that lives in households earning under $50,000 a
year.

            <p>Research says Google’s carbon emissions went up by 65% between 2019-2024, not
51% as the tech giant had claimed

In 2021, Google set a lofty goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by
2030. Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite
direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its
latest sustainability report, Google said its carbon emissions had increased
51% between 2019 and 2024.

New research aims to debunk even that enormous figure and provide context to
Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored
by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and
2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between
2010, the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions,
and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos

budgeting looks like in their real lives

From no-buy-years to second-hand shopping, gen Z seems to have its own unique
spending habits. A global rise in the cost of living combined with a highly
competitive job market means that 69% of gen Z use some sort of budget to
manage their finances.

Their priorities, and what they choose to save for, are different from their
boomer counterparts. Gen Z is more likely to spend money on subscriptions,
from meal kits to Spotify. There’s also the trend of “doom spending”, which is
purchasing non-essential items to cope with either personal or wider political
issues.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
