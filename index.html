            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>US stock futures dropped as concerns over whether lawmakers in Washington will
avert a government shutdown at the weekend added to uncertainty around the
outlook for the American economy. Russian President Vladimir Putin will
probably agree to eventual truce terms with Ukraine but wants his own
conditions met beforehand, likely dragging out the negotiations. The Russian
leader wants to make sure his stipulations are taken into account before
agreeing to a ceasefire, according to a person familiar with the Kremlin’s
thinking. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open

            <p>Delis are turning to plant-based egg substitutes as bird flu and inflation
push up the cost of the real thing. But how does the faux BEC compare?

Like a yellow taxi or the pizza rat, the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich has
become a symbol of New York City. You can find a BEC in just about any bodega,
or corner store, where it serves as a cheap, filling breakfast, quick lunch or
hangover cure.

But with egg prices soaring across the country due to inflation and the worst
avian influenza outbreak in history, delis are struggling to keep the price
down. It’s been tough since 2022, when the bird flu began, with reports of

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

            <p>While inflation has declined sharply from its peak in 2022, price increases
have remained above Fed’s target rate of 2%

Consumer prices remained relatively stable in February even as some economists
have warned that prices could rise again amid Donald Trump’s trade war and
stock markets have fallen on fears of a recession.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer Price Index (CPI),
which tracks the prices of a range of goods and services, the annualized
inflation in February was 2.8%, a 0.2% decrease from January’s year-over-year
rate of 3%. The month-by-month price increase for all goods minus the volatile
food and energy industries was 0.2%, compared with January’s 0.4%.

When Nayib Bukele launched his presidential campaign in the eastern department
of La Unión in 2018, the new outsider politician stood in a street packed with
supporters and promised a new airport. La Unión and the rest of El Salvador’s
eastern region have historically been neglected by governments, with few
infrastructure projects and widespread poverty.

Just a month later, Bukele travelled to Germany to lobby for his project.
“Munich airport is interested in operating our new airport that we will build
in La Unión,” he said.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>By turning his back on US allies and global institutions, Trump will help Xi
Jinping advance his plan for a China-centric world

Is Donald Trump China’s worst nightmare or a dream come true? He is both, but
not in equal measure. In the near-term, his tariff-led approach to trade will
cause problems for Beijing. However, in just a few weeks he has done more
damage to the liberal international order, the cohesion of the democratic
west, and the US’s global standing, than all the combined efforts to undermine
them in the entirety of the cold war. This goes beyond the wildest dreams
China’s leaders could have had.

The tariffs already levied are serious enough, and Beijing cannot but see them
as a harbinger of more to come. Unlike during his first term, this time Trump
seems prepared to deliver the threats he makes. With China’s economy already
misfiring, an intensified trade war is the last thing Beijing needs, despite
the bravado of its diplomats.

and co-author of The Political Thought of Xi Jinping

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
