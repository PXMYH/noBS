deco hotels such as the Delano and Raleigh, both undergoing extensive upmarket
refurbishments, and the construction of exclusive new residential tower blocks
with high-end apartments running into the tens of millions.

It is here on the sun-filled shores of South Beach, more than a thousand miles
from the chills of a Manhattan winter, where realtors and developers are
beginning to see the first shoots of what they call the “Mamdani effect”: the
predicted exodus of wealthy New Yorkers in the wake of democratic socialist
Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor.

On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield

shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as
item after item rang up at a higher price.

allegations by Trump associates

Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch authorized a plan for Fox News to embrace Donald
Trump’s false claims of election fraud in 2020 in an attempt to win back
viewers angry with the network, a lawyer for the voting technology company
Smartmatic argued on Tuesday.

“The conservative viewers, their bread and butter, abandoned them,” J Erik
Connolly told the New York state supreme court judge David B Cohen. “So what
do they do? They return back to what they know best: they return back to
disinformation, pro-Trump propaganda and xenophobia. The election story and
the election fraud claims was the perfect vehicle for them to get back on to
their core messaging.”

Shares in Eric Trump’s crypto mining business lost nearly 40% of their value
in less than 30 minutes on Tuesday.

The nosedive of American Bitcoin Corp, which triggered repeated trading halts,
followed the steep decline of many cryptocurrencies and crypto-linked
companies into what some observers are calling the onset of a “crypto winter”.
Bitcoin’s value has fallen sharply since the start of October and erased a
year of large gains.

Costco is suing the Trump administration over its tariffs, arguing that the

that it should be entitled to a refund if the tariffs are found
unconstitutional.

In a lawsuit filed to the court of international trade last Friday, the retail
giant argued the Trump administration had misused the federal law, the
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), it cited to impose the
tariffs.

Thousands of Starbucks baristas are on strike across the US, warning the
world’s largest coffee chain to brace for the “longest and biggest” bout of
industrial action in its history.

Barely a year after Brian Niccol, the Starbucks CEO, tried to draw a line
under bitter divisions between its management and unionized workers, pledging

grappling with an escalating strike during its lucrative holiday trading
season.

  * Politics live –latest updates

Britain’s budget watchdog has said the early leak of its budget documents
before Rachel Reeves made her speech was the “worst failure” in its 15-year
history as it emerged a similar breach had occurred earlier this year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said an investigation had found
that the leadership of the organisation, over many years, was to blame for the
early release of its Economic and Fiscal Outlook (EFO) document online nearly
an hour before Reeves’s address last Wednesday.

Airbus has fixed most of its jets affected by a software glitch after a

Monday after it discovered a separate issue with its fuselage panels.

Airlines around the world cancelled and delayed flights over the weekend after
the French plane manufacturer ordered immediate repairs to 6,000 of its A320
family of jets, more than half of its global fleet.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
