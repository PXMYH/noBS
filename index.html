            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Bank of England policy maker Catherine Mann explains how she made the decision
to switch her vote on the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee from raising UK
rates to holding them steady at 5.25% due to a softening labor market and
because consumers are spending less on discretionary services, like hotels and
restaurants. Speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television from Belfast,
she also said financial markets are pricing in too many interest-rate cuts
this year and that it’s unlikely the UK will move before the US Federal
Reserve. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>Former FTX CEO faces up to 100 years in prison should the judge hand out the
harshest penalty

Sam Bankman-Fried, once the CEO of FTX and a billionaire wunderkind of the
cryptocurrency world, will be sentenced to prison time on Thursday in New York

Splitting the bill with Venmo, paying with your Starbucks app, tap-and-go with
your phones – how we pay for things has changed forever. But while our options
have changed, and are still changing, some small business owners seem
determined to either keep us counting bills or jump feet first into their idea
of the future.

Case in point from my home town: the owner of the restaurant in South

buying or selling a home will look like.

            <p>Justice department lawsuit alleges tech giant illegally prevented competition
by restricting access to its software and hardware

The US government on Thursday filed a sprawling antitrust case against Apple,
alleging that the tech giant has illegally prevented competition by
restricting access to its software and hardware. The case is a direct
challenge to the company’s core products and practices, including its iMessage
service and how devices such as the iPhone and Apple Watch connect with one
another.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Apple has
monopoly power in the smartphone market and uses its control over the iPhone
to “engage in a broad, sustained, and illegal course of conduct”. The
complaint states that the case is about “freeing smartphone markets” from
Apple’s anticompetitive practices, arguing that the company has thwarted
innovation to maintain market dominance.

The Dutch airline KLM has misled customers with vague environmental claims and

found.

In a greenwashing case brought by the campaign group Fossielvrij, the district

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,

with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
