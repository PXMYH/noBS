  * Trump says EU tariffs will ‘definitely happen’ as Mexico, Canada and China retaliate

Here’s a chart showing how Canada’s currency fell to its weakest level in more

The loonie (as it’s known in foreign exchange circles) fell almost 1.48 per US
dollar, its lowest level since 2003, amid a general surge in demand for the US

            <p>The dollar surged while equity markets and digital currencies plunged after
President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose tariffs on imports
from Canada, Mexico and China. The rapid escalation in trade tensions rippled
through markets. European and US stock futures slumped, while an index of
Asia-Pacific shares dropped the most in nearly six months. Fears the action
will stoke price pressures also spurred a rise in the yields on two-year US
Treasuries, while the Canadian dollar sank to its weakest since 2003 and
emerging market currencies such as the Indian rupee and the Mexican peso also
posted losses. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets
open across Europe. With analysis you won&#39;t find anywhere else, we break down

When Donald Trump announced – three days before assuming the presidency of the
United States, and followed shortly by Melania Trump – that he was launching a
self-named “meme coin” cryptocurrency, many in the crypto industry were quick
to express frustration. Ethics experts were also alarmed.

Among Trump’s base, however, a similar backlash – smaller, more muted, but
similarly anguished – has been taking hold.

  * US politics – live updates
  * Trump to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China

As Donald Trump threatens to slap steep tariffs on many countries, he is
boasting that his taxes on imports will be a boon to the US economy, but most
economists strongly disagree – many say Trump’s tariffs will increase
inflation, slow economic growth, hurt US workers and result in American
consumers footing the bill for his tariffs.

“Virtually all economists think that the impact of the tariffs will be very
bad for America and for the world,” said Joseph Stiglitz, an economics
professor at Columbia University and a winner of the Nobel prize in economic
sciences. “They will almost surely be inflationary.”

Donald Trump has been accused of launching an “attack on the rule of law” as
three former heads of the top US labor watchdog criticized the unprecedented
firing of a top official.

The abrupt removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) leaves the agency “out of business” unless a replacement is nominated,
they warned – and highlights a “real danger” to the independence of regulators
and adjudicators now Trump is back in the White House.

popular free app in Apple’s US and UK app stores. Despite its popularity with
international users, the app appears to censor answers to sensitive questions

What happened on June 4, 1989 at Tiananmen Square?

What happened to Hu Jintao in 2022?

Why is Xi Jinping compared to Winnie-the-Pooh?

What was the Umbrella Revolution?

Visitor visas will now allow people to work remotely for a foreign employer
while they are visiting New Zealand for up to 90 days. The visa can be
extended up to nine months but visitors may need to pay tax during this time.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
