Earlier this month the Trump administration moved forward with eliminating a
loophole that allowed businesses to avoid tariffs if making purchases under
$800. Some experts say that the “de minimis” exemption will hit “many, many”
small businesses hard.

“The de minimis suspension ending is yet another change that has forced every
American small business owner to become an accidental trade policy expert
overnight,” Jacob Bennett, CEO and co-founder of small business banking
platform Crux Analytics, told Forbes. “There’s this whiplash effect that many,
many small business owners are now feeling which is leading to growing
uncertainty and concern about how they’re going to continue running their
business.”

            <p>Former officials and experts say Bill Pulte’s request for inquiry into Fed
governor’s alleged fraud is ‘unusual’

The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency embraced a highly unusual
process to accuse Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, of committing
mortgage fraud, former officials and experts have said. One former high-
ranking official called the director’s involvement in a criminal referral
“bizarre”.

William Pulte, a businessman and major GOP donor whom Donald Trump appointed
to head the powerful housing agency earlier this year, has accused Cook of
committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting her homes as a primary residence,
potentially securing more favorable mortgage rates. The justice department
formally opened a criminal investigation into whether Cook committed fraud and
has issued subpoenas related to the transaction. Cook’s lawyers have called
the discrepancies a “clerical error” and she has denied any wrongdoing.

change after years of bitter fighting with the company’s burgeoning union.

“I deeply respect the right of partners to choose, through a fair and
democratic process, to be represented by a union,” Niccol wrote in a letter to
the union last September. “If our partners choose to be represented, I am
committed to making sure we engage constructively and in good faith with the
union and the partners it represents.”

            <p>Issue creates clear dividing line between left and right, as populists target
voters with vow to scrap levy

It is the issue that has set the Norwegian general election alight: whether to
keep, cut or abolish the national wealth tax. As the country prepares to go to
the polls on Monday, Norway is in the grip of a ferocious national argument
that is likely to rumble on whichever party wins.

In an economy less then a seventh the size of Britain’s, the _formuesskatt_
raises about 32bn kroner (£2.4bn). Multiply that by the difference in GDP, and
the same rules applied in the UK could raise more than £17bn – serious money
in tax terms. Defenders say the wealth tax has another benefit. They see it as
the cornerstone of a progressive tax system that has helped to create one of
Europe’s most equal societies.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
