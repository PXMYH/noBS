On 1 April, the same day California’s new $20 hourly minimum wage for fast-
food workers went into effect, a new restaurant opened in north-east Los
Angeles that was conspicuously light on human staff.

CaliExpress by Flippy claims to be the world’s first fully autonomous
restaurant, using a system of AI-powered robots to churn out fast-food burgers
and fries. A small number of humans are still required to push the buttons on
the machines and assemble the burgers and toppings, but the companies involved

            <p>Nine states are hashing out bills to protect minors online. Tech companies are
fighting the laws with everything they’ve got

On 6 April, Maryland became the first state in the US to pass a “Kids Code”
bill, which aims to prevent tech companies from collecting predatory data from
children and using design features that could cause them harm. Vermont’s
legislature held its final hearing before a full vote on its Kids Code bill on
11 April. The measures are the latest in a salvo of proposed policies that, in
the absence of federal rules, have made state capitols a major battlefield in
the war between parents and child advocates, who lament that there are too few
protections for minors online, and Silicon Valley tech companies, who protest
that the recommended restrictions would hobble both business and free speech.

Known as Age-Appropriate Design Code or Kids Code bills, these measures call
for special data safeguards for underage users online as well as blanket
prohibitions on children under certain ages using social media. Maryland’s
measure passed with unanimous votes in its house and senate.

Fine. But for me it’s performance that counts

Cannabis. Caffeine. Adderall. Xanax. Ritalin. Vicodin. Tito’s and Jameson.
These are all legal substances in most states. Some can only be used when
medically prescribed. The others are used “recreationally” and more people are
using them than ever before. I know this because I know many of these people.
They’re friends, workmates and even family. I’m one of those people. Do I
care? Not one bit. We’re all grownups, right?

As an employer, though, maybe I should care when my employees are doing this
on the job. It’s no surprise that the use of substances while at work is on
the rise. A recent piece by Ella Glover in Dazed cites a survey from the

founded in 1944 have lots to talk about this week

There is likely to be a sense of relief when the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank hold their half-yearly meetings in Washington this week.
Not because the world is crisis-free – it clearly isn’t – but because since
they met six months ago no fresh crisis has emerged.

The past half-decade has been as tough as any period in the history of the two
organisations. First there was the pandemic, then the surge in inflation as
lockdown restrictions were lifted. The cost of living problems were amplified
by the war in Ukraine. Then, last October, two days before the start of the
IMF/World Bank meetings in Marrakech – and just as things appeared to be
calming down – Hamas launched its attack on Israel.

knows why: “Workers have realized they’ve been getting screwed for decades,
and they’re fed up.”

The United Auto Workers (UAW) president has emerged at the front of the pack

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
