struggling pharmacy chain operator hit by sluggish consumer spending and low
drug reimbursement rates.

The company also narrowly beat Wall Street’s lowered estimates for fourth-
quarter adjusted profit, and forecast fiscal-year earnings that were mostly in
line with expectations. Its shares jumped 5.4% to $9.50 in pre-market trading.

Climate campaigners have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission to investigate whether “fly carbon neutral” and other
sustainability claims by Qantas are misleading or deceptive.

The greenwashing complaint, filed by the Environmental Defenders Office on
behalf of research and advocacy organisation Climate Integrity, urged the
competition watchdog to investigate the airline’s marketing materials and the
credibility of the company’s transition to net zero.

Taiwan is expected to have access to low earth orbit satellite internet
service by the end of the month, a step the government says is crucial in case
a Chinese attack cripples the island’s communications.

The forthcoming service is via a contract between Taiwan’s main telecoms

vulnerabilities, particularly its internet access, after attempts to get
access to Elon Musk’s Starlink service collapsed.

corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
