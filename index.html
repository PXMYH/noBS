A Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp

mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the
Russian government said on Thursday.

The decision to promote Max comes as Moscow, locked in a standoff with the
west over Ukraine, is seeking greater control over the internet. The Kremlin
said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government
services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”,
including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm

of which are still in a testing phase.

            <p>Forget productivity! Author and consultant Bree Groff believes the true sign
of a successful workplace is how much fun the employees are having. Is this
the answer to post-Covid burnout and disengagement?

Who would say work was fun? Your job might be rewarding (some of the time).
You may get on with your colleagues (some of them). But _fun_? It seems
simultaneously too grand an ambition and too small.

After the work-centric “hustle culture” of the 2010s, then the backlash and
widespread burnout brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the general feeling
around work right now could be described as ambivalent at best. At worst, it’s
openly combative, as evinced by frequent references to the “battle” over
working from home. Managers want employees back in the office; employees want
flexibility, and to limit work’s impact on their lives.

Three leading US economists are urging their peers around the world to push
back against Donald Trump’s attack on environmental laws.

In what amounts to a call to action to economists, the trio say rollback of
environmental regulations is “inconsistent or antithetical” to fundamental
principles of economics over how to allocate the world’s limited resources for
the greatest possible value to society.

Withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.

Eliminating consideration in federal policy of the well-established effects of
climate breakdown on public welfare.

Executive orders to “drill baby drill” giving priority to fossil fuel energy
production.

Ending research funding on environment and climate and the collection of
environmental data.

Reducing investments and regulations designed to tackle lead and forever
chemicals in drinking water.

Donald Trump’s hugely disruptive trade war is setting the stage for a
manufacturing renaissance in the US, administration officials say. Outside the
White House, many economists are skeptical.

Global trade experts point to many reasons they believe the president’s
tariffs will fail to bring about a major resurgence of manufacturing, among
them: Trump’s erratic, constantly changing policies, his unfocused, across-
the-board tariffs, and his replacing Joe Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach to
brandish sticks at the world.

Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
