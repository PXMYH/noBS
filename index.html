couple who own a bed and breakfast in the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge,
Georgia. They also understand that when some guests arrive, it may be the
first time they spend the night with Black hosts.

So when people peruse the website of Stockbridge Lakes Bed &amp; Breakfast, they
see images of a picturesque lake, lush landscaping and elegant bedrooms. They
learn about the gourmet breakfasts, the sleeping porch and the paddle boats
that guests are free to use. But they won’t find any photos of the innkeepers.

strong, and may continue for years

When you hear “startup”, you might think of the millions of entrepreneurs who
have founded new businesses over the past few years. But these are mostly
freelancers, contractors and people with full-time jobs who can accommodate a
side gig. The real startup story is quietly happening elsewhere: trillions of
dollars of wealth are slowly being transferred to a younger generation by
boomers selling their businesses to those looking to build their own.

According to a new report from BizBuySell, a business brokerage and research
site, the number of small businesses being sold has not only recovered to pre-
pandemic levels, but is quickly rising. And the market for would-be
entrepreneurs is hot. Business owners who sold their companies in the second
quarter of this year are getting 20% higher prices than those who sold their
businesses the same time last year.

            <p>Tens of thousands descend for the D23 conference – will familiar faces and
bigger parks maintain their loyalty?

It was Friday night, and the southern California stadium was packed with
cheering fans. They wore light-up bracelets and homemade costumes, and
screamed every time a new A-list celebrity made a surprise appearance.

This wasn’t a pop concert or a sports game. It was a marketing event for Walt
Disney, a company with a legion of fans so devoted that about 15,000 were
willing to buy a ticket and come to Anaheim, California, to see its newest
film and TV advertisements first.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
