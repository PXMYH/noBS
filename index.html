Starbucks’ Australian business has posted a financial loss in a major blow to
its turnaround plans, raising questions about the coffee chain’s ability to
win over a market wary of costly lattes and flavoured Frappuccino.

Starbucks Coffee Australia posted a $5.8m loss last financial year, new
documents lodged with the regulator show, in a period marked by rising living

$2,077,618,725 (£1.62bn). This is the first official disclosure of the tour’s

As the labor movement braces for a second Trump term, union members and their
leaders are celebrating a major victory over a controversial law that stripped
public sector unions of collective bargaining rights.

In response to a lawsuit alleging that a notorious law passed by the former
Republican governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker in 2011 is unconstitutional, a
county judge ruled on Monday that more than 60 sections of the law and several
sections of a follow-up law in 2015, Act 55, are unconstitutional.

Of all the businesses started just 10 years ago, only one-third are still in
existence. That’s according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. One
in five startups fail in their first year. Agriculture and forestry businesses
survive the longest (but only half were in operation 10 years later), and a
quarter of mining, oil and gas firms made it that far. The bottom line is that
a whopping number of new businesses – about 66% – go out of business within a
decade.

Why do so many businesses fail? Of course, there’s not just one reason.

            <p>Automakers face uncertainty as top-selling vehicles, such as the Ford F-150
truck, are sourced from around the globe

Few vehicles are as emblematic of the American auto industry’s might as the
Ford F-150 pickup truck, the nation’s best-selling vehicle for over 40 years.
But the F-150 is much less American than its image suggests. A fact that could
present unique challenges for the company as Donald Trump moves to “make
America great again”.

Only about 32% of its components are made in the US or Canada, federal data
shows, and that could spell trouble if Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported
goods are implemented. Even less of the F-150 Lightning electric truck is made
in the US – about 24%, a Cars.com analysis of federal data showed.

The killing appeared so well-planned that at first glance many assumed it was
a professional hit.

The gunman who shot dead Brian Thompson, head of one of the US’s largest
health insurance companies, on a New York street before dawn lay in wait with
a weapon fitted with a silencer, kept his cool as his gun jammed and made a
nimble escape after ensuring that his victim had been fatally struck.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>FEC filings offer only a glimpse of the money tech is pouring into Washington
as it seeks to influence government

Silicon Valley poured more than $394.1m into the US presidential election this
year, according to a Guardian analysis, the bulk of it coming from an enormous
donation of about $243m Elon Musk made to Donald Trump’s campaign.

The analysis of new election data from the US Federal Election Commission
(FEC) shows the increasingly heavy influence of the tech industry in US
elections. Advocates of cryptocurrency were particularly active in this
election as they fought to stave off regulation, pumping money into the
presidential campaigns and key congressional races.

$242.6m from **Elon Musk** , owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter)
who has an estimated net worth of $350bn.

$5.5m from **Marc Andreessen** , the billionaire founder of venture capital
firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z. Andreessen’s co-founder, Ben
Horowitz, initially supported Trump but flipped to Harris.

$5.1m from **Jan Koum** , the founder of WhatsApp who made the bulk of his
fortune when Facebook acquired the messaging app in 2014 for $19bn.

$51.1m from the Facebook co-founder **Dustin Moskovitz** , who left the social
media company in 2008 to start the workflow software company Asana.

$17m from **Reid Hoffman** , the co-founder of LinkedIn.

$11.7m from **Chris Larsen** , the billionaire chair of Ripple, a
cryptocurrency company.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
