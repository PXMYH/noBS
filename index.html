Australia’s inflation rate slowed less than expected in the March quarter as
rents and education costs increased, dimming hopes the cost-of-living crunch
was easing and lessening chances of a 2024 cut in official interest rates.

The consumer price index for the first three months of 2024 was 3.6% higher
than a year earlier, slowing from the 4.1% annual pace in the December
quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had
tipped CPI growth would drop to 3.5%.

Tesla shares surged nearly 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after posting
earnings results, despite a revenue miss for the first quarter of 2024, a
steep decline in profits, and a recall of its most recently released car, the
$100,000 Cybertruck.

The electric vehicle manufacturer posted $21.3bn in revenue, lower than the
$21.48bn that was estimated and a 9% drop year over year – marking its biggest
decline since 2012. Profit was $1.1bn, a 55% decline from the first quarter of
2023, the company said.

US companies would no longer be able to bar employees from taking jobs with
competitors under a rule approved by a federal agency on Tuesday, though the
rule is sure to be challenged in court.

The Federal Trade Commission voted to ban measures known as noncompete
agreements, which bar workers from jumping to or starting competing companies

US supreme court justices on Tuesday appeared to agree with Starbucks in the
coffee chain’s challenge to a judicial order requiring it to rehire seven
employees at a Tennessee cafe who were fired as they pursued efforts to
unionize.

The justices heard arguments in the company’s appeal of a lower court’s

harder to bring a quick halt to labor practices challenged as unfair under
federal law while the NLRB resolves complaints.

“Exceptionally strong” demand boosted sales at two US defense giants, the

East and Ukraine continues to fight Russia’s invasion.

RTX and Lockheed Martin exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the latest
quarter as conflicts including Israel’s war on Gaza prompted countries to

contracts.

The prospects of a summer cut in UK interest rates have receded after the Bank
of England’s chief economist said inflation must be squeezed out of the
economy and cautioned against cutting too soon.

After a key survey signalled strong sales across the private sector over the
past month and the London stock market rose to a record high, Huw Pill said
concerns remained that inflation, which is expected to fall below its 2%
target within a few months, could then rebound as the economy strengthens.

slipped, and a nail struck him just above the ankle, it became “really
swollen”.

Antonio was given hydrogen peroxide, and the contractor promised to get him

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
