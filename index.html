            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said the US central bank risks damage
to the economy by not moving rapidly to lower interest rates. Miran, a new Fed
board member who was appointed by President Donald Trump, is an outlier among
the central bank’s policymakers in calling for immediate, aggressive rate
cuts. He argued the Fed’s current policy rate, which is in a range of 4% to
4.25%, is highly restrictive because it’s well above his estimate of the so-
called “neutral” level -- where policy neither boosts nor restrains the
economy. Bloomberg Economics US and Canada Economist Stuart Paul joins
Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss Miran&#39;s comments, plus the latest
headlines from other Fed speakers. He joins Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

and his show”, it said in a letter to Disney.

            <p>Under the known terms of the deal with China, TikTok would get a new board,
including Murdochs and Ellisons

Donald Trump revealed last week the US and China are close to inking a deal to
let TikTok continue operating in the US. Details are not final, but should the

powerful cable TV channels may soon also steer the nation’s most influential
social network. The arrangement would gift Trump’s billionaire allies a degree
of control over US media that would be vast and unprecedented.

Here’s what we know. Under the known terms of the deal, which Trump declared

its security.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
