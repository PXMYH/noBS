China’s leaders seem to have invoked the definition of insanity, attributed,
perhaps wrongly, to Einstein: doing the same thing over and over again, and
expecting different results.

For the fourth time in 16 years, Beijing has been spooked by faltering growth
into adopting an array of economic stimulus measures designed to reset the

measures announced recently will also most likely come up short.

One of the world’s largest music companies has been accused of depriving
“potentially hundreds” of artists and bands of their royalties by the 90s nu-
metal band Limp Bizkit.

Three decades after it rose to prominence, the band and its founder, Fred

fraudulently concealing royalties from the band.

As millions of US residents begin working to file insurance claims on their
homes in the aftermath of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, many could be denied,
particularly if their homes were damaged by flooding.

A quirk in the US home insurance market is that flood insurance is separate
from typical home insurance, which usually covers wind damage from hurricanes
but not flooding. Homeowners must purchase flood insurance separately if they
want their homes protected against flooding.

            <p>From football clubs to water companies, music catalogues to care homes,
private equity has infiltrated almost every facet of modern life in its
endless search to maximise profits

Whenever I ponder the enormity of the multitrillion-dollar industry known as
private equity, I picture the lavish parties thrown by Stephen Schwarzman –
and then I think of the root canals. Schwarzman is the billionaire impresario
of Blackstone, the world’s most colossal private equity firm. In August, he
hosted a 200-person housewarming party at his $27m (£21m) French neoclassical
mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. It was a modest affair compared to the grand
soiree he threw himself at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate for his 70th
birthday, in 2017. That black-tie bash was itself a sequel to his
multimillion-dollar 60th, in 2007, which became a symbol of the sort of Wall
Street excess that led to the global financial crisis. The Palm Beach party,
which some reports say cost more than $10m, featured Venetian gondolas,
Arabian camels, Mongolian acrobats and a giant cake in the shape of a Chinese
temple. “Brilliantly stimulating” was the billionaire industrialist David
Koch’s review. Gwen Stefani serenaded Schwarzman as Jared Kushner, Ivanka
Trump and several members of her father’s cabinet looked on. It was a world in
miniature, ruled over by a modern Croesus – the perfect symbol for a form of
money-making that has infiltrated almost every facet of modern life.

Preschools and funeral homes, car washes and copper mines, dermatologists and
datacentres – private equity is anywhere and everywhere that money changes
hands. If it can in any way be marketed or monetised, private equity firms
have bought it – from municipal water supplies to European football clubs to
the music catalogue of the rock group Queen. By some estimates, these firms
now control more than $13tn invested in more than 50,000 companies worldwide.
“We cannot overestimate the reach of private equity across the global
economy,” Sachin Khajuria, a former partner at Apollo Global Management, which
manages half a trillion dollars in assets, wrote in 2022.

Even though the vast majority of US labor unions have endorsed Kamala Harris,
many union members support Donald Trump, and with the race so close, unions
have stepped up efforts to convince those workers that Trump is no friend of
unions or workers.

In Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – states that Harris badly needs to
win – union households are an important voting bloc, and unions have mobilized
thousands of members to engage in worksite conversations, door-knocking and
phone-banking to make the case that Harris is far better for workers than
Trump.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
