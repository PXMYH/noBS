            <p>The controversial $8bn deal was finalized this week and while details are
scarce, the future is set to look very different for one of the biggest
Hollywood studios

The merger between Paramount and Skydance has finally been completed, with
various roadblocks (including Stephen Colbert, apparently, as well as the
related 60 Minutes settlement/bribery) cleared from the path of a new entity
called Paramount, A Skydance Corporation.

It’s an appropriately franchise-y moniker for a merger between a major
Hollywood studio and a company that made its bones as a constant financer of
some of its biggest movie series. This ends (for now) years of speculation
over what might be done with Paramount, a global conglomerate that was
nonetheless considered on less sure footing than its fellow remaining big five
studios, Disney, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. (Well, maybe not the
recently embattled Warner Bros, though they seem to have gotten a major
reprieve with their killer 2025 slate) Skydance honcho David Ellison is the
new Paramount CEO. The new co-chairs of Paramount Pictures will be Skydance
executive Dana Goldberg and former Sony executive Josh Greenstein.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
