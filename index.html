            <p>Investors are geared up for Wednesday&#39;s Federal Reserve decision amid bets
officials signal their wait-and-see stance until there’s more clarity on the
impacts of President Donald Trump’s trade policies. Short-term Treasury yields
rose as traders trimmed wagers on rate cuts, seeing around three quarter-point
reductions in 2025 starting in July. With the central bank expected to keep
its benchmark rate steady at 4.25%-4.50% on Wednesday, traders will be
scrutinizing comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell for insight into officials’
interpretation of recent data and whether Trump’s economic policies are
prompting any change in view on when to ease policy. Frances Donald, chief
economist at RBC, explains why she believes the Fed will be forced to wait to
ease monetary policy based on tariffs&#39; delayed impact on inflation and the
slow speed of US labor market softening. Frances speaks with Tom Keene and Tim
Stenovec on Bloomberg Radio. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>The unpredictability of the US president’s tariff policy on Mexico has already
cost ranchers millions in profit losses

Bandannas veiled ranchers’ mouths and noses, shielding them from heavy dust
clouds kicked up by the Mexican herds of cattle crossing the United States-
Mexico border. The scene looks timeless, routine. The uncertainty isn’t.

In Donald Trump’s first 100 days, the borderland’s cattle industry faces a
huge challenge: threats of a trade war that’s already hitting consumers in the
gut with rising beef prices, from Texas to New York. The on-again, off-again

producers with mounting economic losses.

films “produced in foreign lands”, saying he was “not looking to hurt the
industry”.

In remarks reported by CNBC, Trump said he was planning to discuss the plan

But it wasn’t just Paris’s cuisine they admired. It was also the different
tipping culture. “We were talking about how nice it is in Europe that they pay

that cool,” Petters said. It felt very different from back in the US, where
tipping culture felt “out of control”.

Barbie maker Mattel has said it will increase prices for some products in the

The US represents about half of Mattel’s global toy sales, and the company
imports about 20% of its goods sold in the country from China. Mattel said it
would reduce imports into the US from China to below 15% by 2026.

OpenAI has reversed course in the process of transforming into a for-profit
entity, announcing on Monday that its non-profit arm would continue to control
the business that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI)
products. Previously, the company had sought more independence for its for-
profit division.

“We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from
civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General
of California and Delaware,” said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.
Altman and the chair of OpenAI’s non-profit board, Bret Taylor, said the board
made the choice for the non-profit to retain control of OpenAI.

            <p>Industry says levies would hit supply chains, making medicines potentially

Americans would suffer most if Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imports of

Sydney businessman Robert Jarmyn had a $250,000 shipment of skincare products

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true

high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprising the Port of
Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the
shipping world and an economic driver of California’s huge economy. The

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
