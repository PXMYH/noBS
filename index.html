            <p>Global equities retreated as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek threatened to disrupt
US firms’ artificial intelligence dominance. DeepSeek’s latest AI model comes
as four of the Mag-7 tech stockS post results later this week, with traders
watching how the companies will defend their generous AI spending. DeepSeek is
seen by some as cost-effective while running on less-advanced chips, posing a
challenge to US industry leaders like Nvidia Corp. and their sky-high
valuations. Meanwhile, Colombian traders are bracing for a volatile session on
Monday as the South American nation reversed its decision to reject the return
of the migrants after Trump announced an emergency 25% tariff on all Colombian
goods coming into the US. Today&#39;s guests: Emmanuel Cau, Barclays Bank; Clemens

say the industry’s poised for laxer oversight

With Donald Trump tapping top regulators with cryptocurrency ties and
promising to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”, the controversial
and scandal-plagued industry is poised for laxer oversight and faster growth,
which ethics watchdogs and ex-prosecutors fear could pose dangers for
investors and spur potential criminal abuses.

The president’s pro-crypto stances have come as he wooed crypto companies to
ratchet up their campaign contributions to help him win the White House.
Although in 2021 Trump called Bitcoin a “scam”, he also announced last fall
that he and his sons were helping launch a new crypto business, dubbed World
Liberty Financial, they can profit from.

Within his first few days in office, Donald Trump reversed four years of work
to increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the federal
government.

Since taking office, he’s signed a flurry of executive orders, two of which
amount to crackdowns on DEI within the federal government. One overturns Joe
Biden’s efforts to increase DEI programs in the federal government, while a
second bans DEI measures from being taken by the federal government.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
