            <p>Tariffs panned by economists for sowing uncertainty that they said made it
challenging for businesses to plan ahead

US consumer confidence plunged to the lowest level in more than four years in
March, with households fearing a recession in the future and higher inflation
because of tariffs.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday that write-in responses to the survey
showed “worries about the impact of trade policies and tariffs in particular
are on the rise”, adding: “There were also more references than usual to
economic and policy uncertainty.”

Elon Musk appears to be laying the groundwork to privatize some space and
satellite operations now under the authority of National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), or steer lucrative contracts toward his
SpaceX and Starlink companies, former agency employees say.

They’re sounding the alarm as at least four other federal agencies have
reportedly begun pushing new contracts toward Musk’s Starlink satellite
internet company. Musk, the world’s richest man, has been tasked by Donald
Trump with drastically slashing the federal government workforce and costs.

  * Photographs by Haron Forteau  

It is hard to describe the putrid stench of the decaying sargassum seaweed
blanketing miles of shoreline in Soubise, a fishing village in Grenada. The
pungent odour wafts into passing vehicles, persisting long after they have
left the Caribbean island’s coves, where the ocean has deposited masses of the
seaweed, which turns red then black as it rots.

Many residents of Soubise, one of the areas worst affected, say they have
learned to live with the problem, which has plagued the island, and others
like it, for years. Last week scientists in Florida said they thought they had
identified a weather phenomenon in 2009 as the “tipping point” of the problem,
which they said is caused by shifting winds churning up the ocean and bringing
deepwater nutrient concentrations to the surface.

Globalisation “may have now run its course” in its current form, according to
the chair of HSBC, as geopolitical tensions and US tariffs threaten to upend
existing global trade.

Speaking at the bank’s global investment summit in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Sir
Mark Tucker warned that trade tensions created uncertainty that posed a
“serious potential risk to global growth”, in remarks reported by the
Financial Times. He predicted stronger economic ties would develop between
regional groups and trade blocs.

to Heathrow, as Ed Miliband announces investigation

The chief executive of Heathrow has defended the running of the airport after
a fire at an electrical substation stopped about 1,300 planes and disrupted
the journeys of hundreds of thousands of global passengers.

It comes after Willie Walsh, the International Air Transport Association’s
director general, criticised Heathrow for the disruption, while the energy
secretary, Ed Miliband, has now ordered the National Energy System Operator to
“urgently investigate” the outage.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>International trade boomed with the city’s early adoption of technological and
economic changes, but Black neighborhoods became ‘sacrifice zones’

Oakland, California, is often treated as a city on the margins, best known for
its struggles with poverty and gun violence, as well as for its history of
radical Black activism. But a new book, The Pacific Circuit, argues that
Oakland should be viewed as one of the centers of global change in the past
century, serving both as a key node in the new global economy built around
trans-Pacific trade, and as one of the “sacrifice zones” this economy
requires.

Far from being an outlier, US journalist Alexis Madrigal argues, Oakland is in
fact an early adopter of the technological and economic changes now tearing
through cities across the US, and around the world. Oakland has long been the
canary in Silicon Valley’s coalmine of disruption, the book suggests. But its
residents don’t suffer passively: they organize and learn how to fight back.

Prospects for the US economy have cooled significantly in a matter of months.
After outperforming its international peers last year, warning lights are
flashing on a dashboard of economic indicators as analysts warn that Donald
Trump’s erratic approach is hitting the world’s largest economy.

Fears of a US recession this year are growing, in what is being called a
“Trumpcession”, amid a sharp decline in business and consumer confidence as
the president threatens punitive import tariffs on US allies and enemies
alike.

This has been a long time coming for Brough Brothers, which opened its first
location in 2020 and had drawn up ambitious plans for international growth in
2025. Then Donald Trump returned to power.

she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
