Ngerukewid, also known as the ‘Seventy Islands’, is a group of dozens of

lucrative oil trade. Details of the possible new measures were still being

might target some Russian oil exports, according to people familiar with the
matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. In the
Middle East, Israel stepped up its attacks on military sites in Syria, hitting
hundreds of targets, from airfields to weapons production sites, and sending
troops deeper into the country. The offensive targeted warehouses and weapons
depots in several parts of Syria including the capital Damascus, according to

The EU’s new competition chief has signalled a shake-up of anti-trust rules to
make it easier for innovative companies to merge, as well as a relaxation of
state aid policy to spur the green transition.

In her first major speech since taking office last week, Teresa Ribera said EU
merger and anti-trust rules needed to “take full account of innovation and
future competition”, signalling a move towards the reform agenda laid out by
the former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi in a widely feted report.

General Motors is threatening to tear down Detroit’s tallest skyscraper
currently housing the automaker’s headquarters if taxpayers don’t contribute
$250m in subsidies for a renovation, a move that critics labeled “extortion”
and has generated public outrage.

The riverfront building, called the RenCen, is the centerpiece of the skyline
in the world’s auto capital. Development observers and the public have also
panned the renovation plan in part because it calls for demolishing two of
five office towers GM owns in the RenCen complex – they say the automaker
could instead convert it to apartments, or find other uses.

political protege and heir apparent, against the patriarch’s three other
oldest children.

The killing appeared so well-planned that at first glance many assumed it was

The gunman who shot dead Brian Thompson, head of one of the US’s largest
health insurance companies, on a New York street before dawn lay in wait with
a weapon fitted with a silencer, kept his cool as his gun jammed and made a
nimble escape after ensuring that his victim had been fatally struck.

            <p>FEC filings offer only a glimpse of the money tech is pouring into Washington
as it seeks to influence government

Silicon Valley poured more than $394.1m into the US presidential election this
year, according to a Guardian analysis, the bulk of it coming from an enormous
donation of about $243m Elon Musk made to Donald Trump’s campaign.

The analysis of new election data from the US Federal Election Commission
(FEC) shows the increasingly heavy influence of the tech industry in US
elections. Advocates of cryptocurrency were particularly active in this
election as they fought to stave off regulation, pumping money into the
presidential campaigns and key congressional races.

$242.6m from **Elon Musk** , owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter)
who has an estimated net worth of $350bn.

$5.5m from **Marc Andreessen** , the billionaire founder of venture capital
firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z. Andreessen’s co-founder, Ben
Horowitz, initially supported Trump but flipped to Harris.

$5.1m from **Jan Koum** , the founder of WhatsApp who made the bulk of his
fortune when Facebook acquired the messaging app in 2014 for $19bn.

$51.1m from the Facebook co-founder **Dustin Moskovitz** , who left the social
media company in 2008 to start the workflow software company Asana.

$17m from **Reid Hoffman** , the co-founder of LinkedIn.

$11.7m from **Chris Larsen** , the billionaire chair of Ripple, a
cryptocurrency company.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
