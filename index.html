            <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to immediately end
temporary legal status for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and
Venezuela, affecting up to half a million people. The court&#39;s order clears the
way for the Department of Homeland Security to end so-called parole programs,
which gave migrants temporary legal status, and marks the second time in less
than two weeks the justices have opened hundreds of thousands of migrants to
possible deportation. The decision was met with dissent from Justices Ketanji
Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, who argued that the court &#34;undervalues the
devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the
lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal
claims are pending.&#34; Bloomberg&#39;s Greg Stohr reports. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>President took to social media to denounce Beijing in the latest development
in his ongoing tariff war

Donald Trump declared that China has “totally violated its agreement” against
the US on trade just two weeks after the countries reached a deal, raising
fears that the trade war will continue to rattle the global economy.

“I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was
going to be a very bad situation,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday
morning. “Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that
China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT
WITH US.”

gunfights have erupted in the Andean region of Pataz as the mines’ riches draw
in brutal crime cartels

Deep in the mountains of northern Peru, a bloody war is being fought over

stretch for miles inside the mountains of Pataz, a gold-rich Andean province
about 130 miles (200km) inland from Peru’s third city, Trujillo. In early May,

some showing signs of torture, in one of the tunnels belonging to an artisanal
miner linked to the province’s largest mining company, Poderosa.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
