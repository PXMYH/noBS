The House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday that would require the
TikTok owner ByteDance to sell the social media platform or face a total ban
in the United States.

The vote was a landslide, with 352 Congress members voting in favor and only
65 against. The bill, which was fast-tracked to a vote after being unanimously
approved by a committee last week, gives China-based ByteDance 165 days to
divest from TikTok. If it did not, app stores including the Apple App store
and Google Play would be legally barred from hosting TikTok or providing web
hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications.

The head of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Wednesday

plug involved in the 5 January Alaska Airlines midair emergency and that video
footage was overwritten.

The NTSB’s chair, Jennifer Homendy, said in a letter to senators that
investigators sought security camera footage when the door plug was opened and
closed in September but were informed the material was overwritten. “The
absence of those records will complicate the NTSB’s investigation moving
forward,” she said.

            <p>High prices, mega mergers and union busting are just water under the bridge
judging from the scramble for a new bag

What’s so special about Trader Joe’s new mini totes? Aesthetics-wise, nothing:
the canvas bag resembles LL Bean’s ubiquitous totes. The only difference is
that these come stamped with the name of a supermarket chain known for its
fancy cheeses, frozen dinners – and the fact that it’s currently one of the
corporations lobbying to declare the National Labor Relations Board
unconstitutional. Union drip, these are not.

Still, there are plenty of people who approach these bags with the same
enthusiasm that Trader Joe’s lawyers reportedly reserve for union busting.
Young women on TikTok have taken to decorating their mini Trader Joe’s totes
with embroidery, patches and paint. It all looks very summer camp. CNN
reported that the tote has reached a cult status not seen since … well, just a
few weeks ago, when pink Stanley tumblers took the world (or at least Target
shopping aisles) by storm.

            <p>More than 90% of new cars sold in Norway are electric. And it all started with
some pop stars driving around in a jerry-built Fiat Panda

I’m kneeling on the snow outside the king’s house, impersonating a 1980s
heart-throb, with a man named Harald and an electric car. It’s a situation
that probably needs some explanation.

Harald isn’t the king, although the king of Norway is also called Harald; we
just happen to be outside the monarch’s residence, a handsome red manor. I’m
in Stavanger to find out how, in a world where transport contributes about 20%
of CO2 emissions, Norway came to lead the world in electric car take-up. In
2023, 82.4% of private vehicles sold in the country were electric. In January,

legislation; its fiercest critics, however, have become even more entrenched
in their demands for changes.

The Kids Online Safety Act (Kosa), introduced more than two years ago, reached

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
