shared industrial future – with or without Donald Trump

The Brics summit in Brazil last week revealed a loose alliance of emerging
powers becoming more complex – and perhaps more consequential. For Brics, heft

ITV and Disney have struck a deal to show programmes such as The Bear and Love
Island on each other’s video platforms, the first such deal in the UK and the
latest sign of the changing content relationship developing between British
broadcasters and US streamers.

Under the deal, ITV will begin showing the first seasons of some of Disney’s
hit programmes – including the hit chef drama, the Star Wars spin-off Andor,
Only Murders in the Building and reality shows such as The Kardashians - free
of charge on its ITVX service from later this month.

            <p>Ex-NBC executive was tasked with building an ‘everything app’, but billionaire
owner was biggest obstacle in her path

In May 2023, when Linda Yaccarino, an NBC advertising executive, joined what
was then still known as Twitter, she was given a tall order: repair the
company’s relationship with advertisers after a chaotic year of being owned by
Elon Musk. But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted an antisemitic
tweet that drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal,
Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the
platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference –
which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to
advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger: “Go fuck yourselves.”
Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.

“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail
me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said.
“Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”

As temperatures soared on a sweltering July day in New York City, shoppers at
Queens’s largest mall said they were feeling the heat – of rising prices.

“T-shirts, basic t-shirts, underwear, the basic necessities – the prices are
going up,” said Clarence Johnson, 48, who was visiting the Macy’s at the Queen
Center mall to pick up shirts he ordered online.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Social housing makes up almost half of the city’s 1m homes. The system isn’t
perfect, but it gets a lot of things right

When it comes to best-practice examples in the housing debate, Vienna is a
common reference. Indeed, the Austrian capital features prominently in
narratives about successful housing policies. An article in the Observer
concluded that Vienna shows “decent homes for all” is not an impossible dream.
And the New York Times even declared it “a renters’ utopia”.

A considerable part of the attraction of Vienna relates to its large social-
housing stock. It accounts for some 43% of the roughly 1m housing units in the
city. About half of it is municipally owned council housing. The other half is
provided and administered by limited-profit housing associations – an Austrian
version of social housing providers that are permitted to make a small profit
to finance their operations. Social housing is not just for those on low
incomes, but also caters to middle- and even some upper-middle-class
households.

British pubs will close down at the rate of one a day this year, the
industry’s trade body has warned, blaming high business taxes. At the same
time, the hospitality sector has called on ministers to tackle “eye-watering”
costs.

The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents more than 20,000
pubs in the UK, said it expects 378 to close this year in England, Scotland
and Wales, at a cost of 5,600 jobs.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
