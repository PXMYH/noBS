Nissan is preparing to pulling out of merger talks with Honda in order to try

The two Japanese automotive firms revealed in December that they were

fossil fuel firms to backtrack on its green promises.

Walt Disney sharply outperformed Wall Street’s quarterly earnings estimates on
Wednesday, with results buoyed by the strong holiday box office performance of
the animated sequel Moana 2 and higher profits at the company’s streaming
business.

The strength in entertainment helped offset a decline at Disney’s domestic
theme parks, which were impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida.
The parks-led Experiences group also incurred about $75m in expenses
associated with the December launch of the Disney Treasure cruise ship.

Vivi Armacost loves Temu. She uses the Chinese online marketplace to buy

hardware for cents and pennies,” said Armacost, who is 24 and lives in New
York. She says it seems like “basically everything” in her apartment comes
from Temu.

Donald Trump’s 10% tariff on China-made goods sold to the US, which went into
effect early on Tuesday morning, might change her shopping habits. On top of
this, the US Postal Service briefly suspended deliveries of incoming parcels

            <p>Underwhelming films and some disinterested buyers left many wondering what’s
next for the Utah-based festival

At the end of last year’s Sundance film festival there may have been some
concerns over the quality of films, but there was less worry over the quantity
of deals. As I wrote last year’s wrap, there had already been major big-money
sales – $10m for A Real Pain, $17m for It’s What’s Inside, $15m for My Old
Ass, $5m for Presence – some smaller ones – Thelma, Ghostlight, Ibelin,
Daughters, Skywalkers and Kneecap – and in the 48 hours after there were even
more – Dìdi to Focus and Will &amp; Harper to Netflix. Post-strikes it was a
reassuringly robust marketplace with gaps that needed to be filled but just a
year later, things are looking far less comforting.

There were even more questions over quality – I heard many a grumble in the
press line over a lack of breakouts – but even so, as of writing, there have
been only four deals confirmed, a worryingly dour result for what’s seen as
one of America’s most important markets. Films with sellable names like
Jennifer Lopez, Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch and Josh O’Connor and some
of the best-reviewed titles remain without distribution.

worked with him.

The British Virgin Islands (BVI) have been accused of a “shameful” attempt to

that threatens to escalate into a constitutional standoff.

MPs have written to the premier of the BVI, while the former development

their proposals for a new register of who owns companies registered on the
islands.

Donald Trump has fired the opening salvo of his trade war, imposing tariffs on
China on Tuesday that sparked instant retaliation from Beijing, amid fears for
the global economic repercussions.

Moments after US tariffs of 10% came into effect, China swiftly announced an
anti-trust investigation into Google. China’s finance ministry also announced
15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10% on crude oil, farm
equipment, large-displacement vehicles and pickup trucks from the US.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
