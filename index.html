restrictions that have drawn strong opposition from major tech companies and
foreign governments. Today&#39;s guests: Kokou Agbo-Bloua, SGCIB Global Head of

            <p>The unpredictability of the US president’s tariff policy on Mexico has already
cost ranchers millions in profit losses

Bandannas veiled ranchers’ mouths and noses, shielding them from heavy dust
clouds kicked up by the Mexican herds of cattle crossing the United States-
Mexico border. The scene looks timeless, routine. The uncertainty isn’t.

In Donald Trump’s first 100 days, the borderland’s cattle industry faces a
huge challenge: threats of a trade war that’s already hitting consumers in the
gut with rising beef prices, from Texas to New York. The on-again, off-again
tariff impositions and worries in February and March jolted Mexican cattle
producers with mounting economic losses.

Donald Trump appears to be softening his tone after widespread dismay in

films “produced in foreign lands”, saying he was “not looking to hurt the
industry”.

In remarks reported by CNBC, Trump said he was planning to discuss the plan
with film industry leaders. “I’m not looking to hurt the industry, I want to

They enjoyed French duck, andouillette, plenty of bread, cheese and coffee and
even escargot.

But it wasn’t just Paris’s cuisine they admired. It was also the different
tipping culture. “We were talking about how nice it is in Europe that they pay
their waiters and waitresses and we don’t have to tip because of it, and isn’t
that cool,” Petters said. It felt very different from back in the US, where
tipping culture felt “out of control”.

Barbie maker Mattel has said it will increase prices for some products in the
US in response to Donald Trump’s tariffs while carmaker Ford said the US
president’s measures would cost it about $1.5bn (£1.1bn) this year.

The US represents about half of Mattel’s global toy sales, and the company
imports about 20% of its goods sold in the country from China. Mattel said it
would reduce imports into the US from China to below 15% by 2026.

leaders’ and state attorneys general

OpenAI has reversed course in the process of transforming into a for-profit
entity, announcing on Monday that its non-profit arm would continue to control
the business that makes ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI)
products. Previously, the company had sought more independence for its for-
profit division.

“We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from
civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General
of California and Delaware,” said CEO Sam Altman in a letter to employees.
Altman and the chair of OpenAI’s non-profit board, Bret Taylor, said the board
made the choice for the non-profit to retain control of OpenAI.

            <p>Industry says levies would hit supply chains, making medicines potentially
unaffordable for some US patients

Americans would suffer most if Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imports of
pharmaceuticals, as medications would become more expensive and potentially
unaffordable for some people, drugmakers have warned.

Drugmakers have been braced for targeted border taxes – similar to the 25%
levies on steel, aluminium and car imports – after the US president threatened
to hit the sector and announced an investigation last month. Last week, Trump
hinted at a possible reprieve for companies, saying they would be given time
to move their operations to the US, But “after that it’s going to be a tariff
wall put up, and they won’t be happy about it,” he added.

Sydney businessman Robert Jarmyn had a $250,000 shipment of skincare products
en route to the US from China when Donald Trump declared his new tariffs
regime at the start of April.

When he received the invoice for that shipment, it had an additional cost
whacked on top: $125,000, simply labelled “Trump tariff”.

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true
action has long been about 40 miles away from Hollywood, in a place where
high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprising the Port of
Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the
shipping world and an economic driver of California’s huge economy. The
busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world,
approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock,
moving billions of dollars’ worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts,
toys, clothes and furniture.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
