movement of “corporate butt kissing” of Donald Trump and says management
blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in

Ben Cohen told the Guardian that Unilever was pursuing a “corporate attack on

The US and China have agreed a framework for a trade deal just days before

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement, forged on the sidelines
of the Association of south-east Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia on
Sunday, would remove the threat of the imposition of 100% tariffs on Chinese
imports starting on 1 November and include “a final deal” on the sale of
TikTok in the US.

Boeing workers at three midwest plants where military aircraft and weapons are

continue a strike that started almost three months ago.

The strike by about 3,200 machinists at the plants in Mascoutah, Illinois, and

walkout last year by 33,000 Boeing workers who assemble commercial jetliners
but threatens to complicate the aerospace company’s progress in regaining its
financial footing.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The world will be pushed into a recession, but perhaps we can build something
more promising from the pieces

The world economy hinges on the success or failure of artificial intelligence.
It’s becoming apparent that we are probably doomed either way.

Employment growth is stuck and wage growth is slowing, especially among low-
paying jobs. Loan delinquencies are rising, driving an increase in
bankruptcies. Consumer confidence has collapsed. And reckless policymaking is
taking its toll. Donald Trump’s trade war is cutting farmers’ access to the
Chinese market and manufacturers’ access to Chinese rare-earth magnets. His
clampdown on migration is hitting access to labor, from agriculture to

growth.

The US has demanded that the European Union roll back its climate and human

as the Trump administration approved a controversial gas export hub along the
Gulf of Mexico coast.

A letter jointly sent by the US and Qatar, two of the three largest LNG
exporters in the world, warned the EU that its new rules pose an “existential
threat” to European economies as they would hinder imports of gas from
countries such as theirs.

Anthony Albanese has struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Donald Trump to
develop critical minerals projects in Australia that will never be
commercially viable.

When it’s laid out like that, it very much sounds as though our prime minister
fell victim to the president’s “art of the deal”. But we are in a new world
where the national value of our critical minerals extends beyond economics,
experts say.

Australia and the US have signed a critical minerals deal designed to break
China’s near complete hold over materials essential to commercial, clean
energy and advanced military hardware.

Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump have committed to each provide at least
US$1bn ($1.54bn) towards a $US8.5bn ($13bn) pipeline of projects in both
countries over the next six months to feed their commercial and defence
industries.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
