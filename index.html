            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>US policymakers led by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have been trying
since early 2022 to use higher interest rates to ease price pressures without
causing the economy to contract -- an ideal scenario that economists call a
“soft landing.” History suggests that’s almost impossible to pull off. But
with inflation falling and economic output growing, economists inside and
outside the Fed are increasingly convinced that policymakers might pull it off
this time.

            <!-- Published time -->
            <p>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 12:00:03 CST</p>
            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Lauren Danson Purvis’s company, Mizuba, has had a successful 10-year run.
Experts advise how she can keep it going while having a baby

Lauren Danson Purvis was fresh out of college in 2012 when she launched Mizuba
Tea Co, her business that imports and sells fine matcha tea from Uji, Japan. A
lifelong tea nerd, Purvis had befriended a tea farmer on a family trip to the
region, which is near Kyoto and is the birthplace of matcha, a stone-milled
jade-colored green tea used in Japanese tea ceremonies. A few years later,
when the farmer she’d become friends with asked for help selling his tea in
the US, Purvis decided to start a business. But she quickly realized how
little she knew about business in general, let alone how to import tea, meet
Food and Drug Administration regulations, and create sell sheets for
retailers. “I never cried so much as I did that first year,” Purvis, 33, says.
“The sheer learning curve was extremely overwhelming. I had no idea what this
entailed, but I knew I loved matcha enough to want to see it happen.”

Her father, a family doctor who ran a practice in the Santa Barbara area for
30 years, shared advice on hiring and setting up her business, and staked
Mizuba with a small loan. Purvis repaid him the first year, and has been
profitable ever since. Her mom came onboard – now known as “the matcha mom” in
the region around the family home – and handles deliveries, receives shipments
and watches inventory. Purvis’s father joined as the CFO, and is in charge of
payroll and financial matters. Her husband, Dan, is a graphic designer who
started out working on packaging. In 2018 he came onboard full-time as the COO
and food safety manager – as well as the company’s janitor.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The streaming platform has shared its most in-depth look at what their many
subscribers have been watching

In news that will excite anyone who spent a substantial chunk of their youth
poring over the purple “Life” section of USA Today for Nielsen ratings and box
office reports, Netflix has released a large chunk of its often-secret
viewership data. The streaming service has long displayed shifting top 10
lists on its homepage, showing what’s currently most watched among their film
and TV offerings. But this new data dump is an 18,000-row spreadsheet
cataloging data for just about any movie or TV show over the course of January
through June of this year.

So what, exactly, are the biggest shows and movies on Netflix? Many of the
most popular shows feature or are aimed at young women. Anyone with access to
social media or a Hot Topic will probably know that Wednesday, the service’s
Addams Family-as-YA reboot, is a huge success; less merchandised but similarly
high up the Netflix charts are Ginny &amp; Georgia (essentially Netflix’s in-house
Gilmore Girls), Outer Banks (a teen mystery series), Firefly Lane (a decades-
spanning drama of female friendship), and the Korean drama series Crash Course
in Romance. There’s also plenty of escapist action-adventure fare, like FUBAR
(a father-daughter action-comedy with Arnold Schwarzenegger that plays a bit
like a True Lies sequel) and the limited series Kaleidoscope (a time-scrambled
heist drama whose episodes can be watched in any order); plus more serious
action-intrigue like The Night Agent (the most-watched Netflix Thing for this
entire six-month period) and The Diplomat (with Keri Russell as a newly
appointed US ambassador).

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
