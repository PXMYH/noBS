            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>As rich westerners fuel demand for the ancient fragrance, a lucrative race for
the resin is killing the trees but leaving little of the trade’s profit for
those gathering it

In a corner of Covent Garden, well-heeled Londoners and tourists browse the
range of frankincense products sold by a leading cosmetics brand while they
drink a complimentary rose and berry tea. Amid the aromatic resin sheathed
under glass, shoppers can buy “age-defying” serums, creams and essences, and
tablets to strengthen brittle nails and hair.

At one counter, a sales assistant is advising customers on how much of the
essential oil to add to their nebuliser to make guests feel relaxed “without
overwhelming them”. Another explains frankincense’s “hydrating and
rejuvenating” properties, including its alleged ability to smooth out fine
lines caused by smiling and squinting. In terms of popularity, she says, it
now far outstrips lavender, tea tree and other botanicals.

Big tech has made some big claims about greenhouse gas emissions in recent
years. But as the rise of artificial intelligence creates ever bigger energy
demands, it’s getting hard for the industry to hide the true costs of the data
centers powering the tech revolution.

According to a Guardian analysis, from 2020 to 2022 the real emissions from
the “in-house” or company-owned data centers of Google, Microsoft, Meta and
Apple are likely about 662% – or 7.62 times – higher than officially reported.

at a Chipotle nowadays let alone consuming products made by six-year-olds with
grubby hands and boogers on their fingers.

So why is everyone so shocked by the countless tales of lemonade stands – like
the ones in Texas, Alabama, Virginia, Colorado and Wyoming, all run by
children – that were shut down out of health violation concerns? Or maybe the
snow-shoveling business in New Jersey run by two teenagers that was forced to
cease because it wasn’t deemed safe? Or the nine-year-old who was selling
cookies baked at home that raised red flags with safety inspectors?

week.

Analysts have included a reduction in the cost of borrowing by the US central
bank in their forecasts for more than a month and investors have placed their
bets accordingly.

The cringe factor can be high when an established brand suddenly aligns itself
with up-to-date values. It did not appear to work well for Gillette, which
suffered a public backlash five years ago to its “toxic masculinity” advert,
or for Marks and Spencer when it brought out an LGBT rainbow- coloured
sandwich to mark Pride.

But new academic research carried out for the advertising industry suggests
that “Go woke, go broke”, the snappy catchphrase devised by rightwing groups
as a warning to brands, has got it all wrong.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
