            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>US President Donald Trump defended his plan to remake the US through the
biggest tariff increases in a century. “Tariffs are about making America rich
again and making America great again. And it’s happening, and it will happen
rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It
won’t be much.” Meanwhile, European stocks climbed and bonds in the region
tumbled Wednesday morning on Germany’s plans to unleash hundreds of billions
of euros for defense and infrastructure. Merz’s CDU/CSU and the rival SDU are
speeding ahead with plans to boost investment rather than wait out a months-
long process to form a governing coalition. Today&#39;s guests: Nataliia

and Mervyn King, emails suggest

Jeffrey Epstein deployed a consultant to push for Jes Staley to become

high-profile figures including the then chancellor, George Osborne, and the
then Bank of England governor, Mervyn King.

The campaign’s efforts were detailed as part of a landmark legal case launched
by Staley against the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Staley is trying to overturn its 2023 decision to ban him from taking senior

enter into third-party agreements with an unnamed AI company.

Thirty-six hours by boat from Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, Deodato
Alves da Silva longs for enough electricity to keep his tucumã and cupuaçu
fruits fresh. These highly nutritious Amazonian superfoods are rich in
antioxidants and vitamins, and serve as a main source of income for farmers in
Silva’s area. However, the lack of electricity to refrigerate the fruit makes
it hard to sell their produce.

Silva’s fruit-growing operation is located in the village of Boa Frente, in
Novo Aripuanã municipality, one of Brazil’s most energy-poor regions, where
there is only one diesel-powered electricity generator working for a few hours
a day.

Major egg corporations may be using avian flu as a ruse to hike up prices,
generating record profits while hurting American consumers, new research
suggests.

The cost of a dozen large eggs hit almost $5 in January – a record high in the
US and more than two and a half times the average price three years ago before
the avian flu outbreak. This signifies a 157% inflation rate for eggs – a
previously go-to affordable protein source for many American families.

Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said on Sunday that government
spending could be separated from gross domestic product reports, in response
to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by the billionaire
businessman Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge)
could possibly cause an economic downturn.

“You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,” Lutnick said on
Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures. “They count government spending as
part of GDP. So I’m going to separate those two and make it transparent.”

Donald Trump’s blitz on federal science agencies has increased the risk of
endangered species going extinct, fired government experts have warned.

The new administration, and its so-called “department of government
efficiency”, led by the billionaire Elon Musk, has fired thousands of

When Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s “truck of the future” in 2019, Filipos could
barely contain his excitement. He quickly paid $100 to get on the waitlist.
Filipos described himself as a “true Tesla fanboy”, and the Cybertruck would
be the third vehicle he’d buy from the company.

“When the Cybertruck came out, I watched the live event that night, and my
wife was sitting there going, ‘No. No. No,’” said Filipos, who lives in a
suburb of Philadelphia and whose last name is being withheld for fear of
online retribution. Despite his wife’s disapproval, Filipos loved the bulky
trapezoidal truck. “I was truly geeking out on it,” he said.

The Trump administration recently announced that it would be laying off

agencies are also losing their jobs.

The timing could not be worse. We’re in the middle of the tax season with
corporations and individuals facing filing deadlines in March and April.
Millions of returns will need to be processed. Refunds will be due. Questions
will need to be answered. But that’s not all.

An Elon Musk ally installed in the US government said in a late night email

option would be shuttered – and its employees would be let go.

The 18F office within the General Services Administration (GSA) created the
IRS Direct File program that allows for free online tax filings. It has been a
frequent target of Musk, and one of the billionaire businessman’s close
associates who holds a key position in the GSA informed staffers that the
agency would close 18F in an email to staffers that arrived around 1am on
Saturday morning.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
