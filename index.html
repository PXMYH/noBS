            <p>Deutsche Bank AG’s securities unit is on track to meet analysts’ revenue
estimates this quarter, with traders performing better while dealmakers are
struggling amid the recent market volatility. “There is a little bit of a
different composition” than analysts currently predict for the investment bank
this quarter, Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said. Investor concerns
about the economic effects of the Trump administration’s policies have fueled
a flight from risk assets in the US. Some of that money has been going to
Europe, where government have vowed to spend hundreds of billions of euros on
defense and infrastructure, after the US scaled back support for Ukraine.
Maxwell Grinacoff, Head of US Equity Derivatives Research at UBS, explains why
he believes investors should get used to more choppiness in markets. Maxwell

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Morgan Stanley is planning to cut about 2,000 employees later this month
across the firm, except for its financial advisers. The move is aimed at
keeping a lid on costs as executives grapple with minimal attrition in their
ranks amid an uncertain economic outlook. The cuts are tied to performance,
changes in worker bases, and the impact of artificial intelligence and
automation, with more job reductions expected in the coming years due to
automation. Also Citigroup Inc. cut payouts to hundreds of top executives in
the final round of a three-year special bonus program that tied their
compensation to the bank&#39;s progress on risk and regulatory matters. The
&#34;Transformation Bonus Program&#34; paid out 68% of the target for 2024 to about
250 senior employees, compared with 94% for 2022 and 80% the following year.

  * Business live – latest updates

China’s government has announced ambitious plans to “vigorously boost
consumption” by putting up pay and reducing financial burdens, in its latest
attempt to increase consumer confidence and lift its struggling economy.

The plans, announced by the ruling Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) central

wage growth” and to improve the mechanisms for adjusting the minimum wage.

            <p>Women’s goods are taxed at a higher rate than men’s, an invisible bias that is
estimated to cost women $2.5bn a year

Many shoppers know about the so-called pink tax – a needless markup on
products marketed to women, even if those products are essentially the same,
just cheaper, when sold to men. Personal care items such as razors, deodorants
and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink
tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.

Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at
the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized
sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.

The UK economy contracted by 0.1% in January, dealing a blow to Rachel Reeves
before the spring statement later this month.

In a surprise to City economists, who had expected 0.1% growth in January, the

she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
