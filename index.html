            <p>Parents in the US pay an average of $11,582 per year for child care for
children under the age of 15. And private equity sees an opportunity, by
racing to consolidate independent daycares. Easy access to capital propels
their growth, but child care experts warn that debt‑loaded roll‑ups drive
teacher turnover and can implode suddenly, wiping out the access they seek to
provide in large numbers. Vermont’s new publicly funded program is an example
of a model that works - a payroll tax and disclosure of child care center
ownership to provide access to those who need it. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>The White House is trying to drive out the Federal Reserve chair. Critics warn
it would be a costly bid to pass the buck

Memo from the White House: inflation is “right on track”, it declared this
week, citing the latest official data. Price growth is now “very low”,
according to Donald Trump. The actual statistics paint a markedly different
picture.

Just six months after he regained power, in part by promising to rapidly
reduce prices, Trump has presided over the chaotic rollout of tariffs on an
array of overseas products that many have argued risk having the exact
opposite effect.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the
immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
