            <p>Newberry Springs was almost lost to the desert. But as America’s ‘mother road’
turns 100, locals see hope that the boom times could return

The tiny desert cafe, caught in a desolate middle between Los Angeles and Las
Vegas, had only been open for five minutes when the first customers of the day
ambled in from the already blistering heat.

It was a Friday morning in June, sand swirling outside across the cracked
street and towards the Bagdad Cafe’s front door. In the same parking lot, a
1950s-era **** sign advertised a motel that no longer exists. In the distance,
only a few surviving businesses remained: a small community center, a veterans
organization and a longstanding roadhouse bar popular with locals. A few miles
to the north, an entire neighborhood was abandoned in the 1990s after mounds
of blowing sand swallowed it whole; today, only rooftops and chimneys peek out
from the towering sand dunes.

            <p>Between AI, changes under Trump and a ‘tougher environment’, what do we really
know about the jobs market?

Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that, as a result of the “tougher
environment” in the labor market, companies are “in control again” and are
warning applicants of “long hours and few boundaries”.

At the same time some industries are reporting worker shortages due to Donald
Trump’s immigration crackdown. And then there’s artificial intelligence, which
is about to devastate the jobs market – or is about to create new jobs.

After years of heated attacks on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, the
Trump administration has begun suggesting recent costly renovations at the
central bank’s Washington DC buildings could justify firing Powell.

Donald Trump’s antipathy for Powell stems mainly from the central bank boss’s
refusal to lower interest rates – something the president has repeatedly
called for.

“It’s sad. I think it killed the town,” says Debbie, sitting in a cafe in

five years ago. “There were lots of men and women working there at the end.”

During its 40 years of operations, workers at Bridgend Ford produced 22m
engines for Ford, Volvo and Jaguar cars, before it closed quietly in September
2020 during ongoing Covid restrictions.

according to Donald Trump. The actual statistics paint a markedly different

Just six months after he regained power, in part by promising to rapidly
reduce prices, Trump has presided over the chaotic rollout of tariffs on an
array of overseas products that many have argued risk having the exact
opposite effect.

at the Federal Reserve headquarters

The White House is pushing for an inspection of the US Federal Reserve
headquarters in Washington after Donald Trump suggested the central bank had
mismanaged funds for building renovations.

The scrutiny comes as Trump has unsuccessfully tried to pressure the Fed
chair, Jerome Powell, to quit and demanded he and other officials lower
interest rates. Powell has said that lowering rates prematurely could lead to
higher inflation, and that Trump’s tariffs had contributed to price increases.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

allegedly caused the company by allowing repeated violations of Facebook
users’ privacy, a lawyer for the shareholders told a Delaware judge on
Thursday.

The parties did not disclose details of the settlement and defense lawyers did
not address the judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware court of chancery.
McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day and she

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the
immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.

Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs

ancient Hawaiian religious sites.

“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the
darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of
Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes,
their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up
to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re
met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
