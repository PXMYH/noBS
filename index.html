            <p>Following Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt&#39;s budget statement on
Wednesday, the opposition Labour Party&#39;s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves
criticized the ruling Conservative Party for its record on the UK economy.
&#34;They&#39;ve had five prime ministers, seven chancellors, now twelve different
growth plans, each achieving less than the last,&#34; Reeves said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#34;If it had been my budget yesterday, the focus would
have been on the plans to grow the economy and unlock private investment,&#34;
Reeves added. (Source: Bloomberg)

every time, every time I come,” says Zach, an “every house” member, which
means he can access all of the 42 houses across the world for £2,920 a year.

            <p>Sixty years after fatal floods and subsidence halted gas extraction in the Po
delta region, politicians are once again eyeing methane reserves. But at what
cost to one of the Mediterranean’s largest wetlands and the people who live
there?

To a visitor driving through Polesine in north-east Italy on a winter morning,
the area might seem blessed with an abundance of wildlife. The biodiversity is
among the richest in Italy, with 400 species of bird, lagoons, marshes and
reed beds that have created a true natural labyrinth. Yet, it soon becomes
obvious that something is not right: houses and fields are all lower than the
road, visibly sunken, protected by embankments about four metres high. The
reason? Without those barriers, they would be under water.

The entire area of Polesine, a strip of land between the Po delta and the
Adriatic Sea, has long suffered the consequences of subsidence, but it was
aggravated by gas extraction, which is why the practice was banned by the
government in 1961.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
