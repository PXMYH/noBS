In January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that
Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms.
Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of
investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972
Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a
symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.

One investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up
virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud
services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut
off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the
Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through
the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon
had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.

            <p>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters
that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who is retiring at the end of 2025,
has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway
conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s
performance.

Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire
morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder
equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.

Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large
northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.

My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a
practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when
you are buying businesses).

Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being
bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’

When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much
as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex
life. It’s not a push he needs.

Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger
companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes
was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s
been swimming naked.)

In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction,
carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone
seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also
whom they are sleeping with.

From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for
ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives
books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that
are required.

When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors
carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.

Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s
promised to attend _my_ 100th.

She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After
retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other
Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)

The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to
work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.

(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the
portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term
‘thinking outside the box’.)

construction where AI can’t easily replace them

While standing on the sideline watching a high school soccer game, my friend,
who owned a small and successful construction company, complained that his son
– a senior – was starting at a respected local university that fall, which

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
