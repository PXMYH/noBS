across Asia and bitcoin hits a seven-month low

Europe’s major share indices are down by more than 1%, as the sell-off spreads
across global markets.

The UK’s FTSE 100 index fell by 0.9%. Germany’s Dax is down 1.3%, France’s CAC
and Italy’s FTSE Mib both lost 1.5%, and Spain’s Ibex dropped 1.6%.

It’s been a challenging start to the week as markets brace for two key events:
Nvidia’s earnings tomorrow night and the US payrolls report on Thursday.

For now, equities remain under pressure, with the S&amp;P 500 (-0.92%) posting a
third consecutive loss [on Monday] for the first time since September and
marking its worst three-day run since April (-2.61%) with futures down another

pushed Nvidia (-1.88%) to another decline.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race
over the economy is costing the US president

Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of
grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living,
propelled by the sharp burst of inflation that peaked at 9% a year in July
2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over
prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the
economy. The other theme was race.

The strategy won the presidency. Then, Trump made a mistake: focusing
relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban
America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’
economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came
back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is now trying to recover his
economic narrative. But it may be too late.

according to the New York Times

After stepping down as Amazon’s CEO four years ago, Jeff Bezos, the
billionaire founder and former chief executive of the online shopping company,
is going to be a CEO again. This time, Bezos has appointed himself co-CEO of
an AI startup called Project Prometheus, the New York Times reported, citing

The startup, which will focus on developing AI for engineering and
manufacturing in various fields, has already received $6.2bn in funding – more

alongside Bezos is his co-founder and co-CEO Vik Bajaj, a celebrity tech
executive in his own right. Bajaj is a physicist and chemist best known for
his work at Google’s moonshot factory, X, where he founded the health startup
Verily.

Gen Z is undisciplined, apparently; entitled, some critics claim; and
purportedly hates work. One viral column in the Wall Street Journal went so
far as to suggest this entire generation was potentially “unemployable”.

As younger employees establishing themselves at work continue to face
relentless criticism from the higher rungs of corporate America, those old
enough to remember the arrival of the last generation could be forgiven for
experiencing a sense of deja vu.

            <p>This story of emancipated young women escaping draconian social strictures
brims with enthusiasm and features a cameo from Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Based on a true story, Bill Guttentag’s rousing drama attests to the
resilience of women who dare to dream despite draconian social strictures. The
film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and
businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who
assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The
young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same
zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women
are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their
quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public
scorn from conservatives.

Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which
splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-
enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.)
A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around
the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces
are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than
competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they
offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.

The former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is making a claim of “conspiracy”
against the government of Jersey after the crown dependency launched a
criminal investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering in
connection with the original source of the oligarch’s wealth.

The latest move threatens to throw open parts of a secretive legal battle on
the Channel island about the tycoon’s rise to become one of the world’s
richest people, which emerged in September after a Switzerland federal
criminal court ordered the release of a cache of Swiss banking records
requested by the Jersey attorney general.

Want to buy a new shirt from your friendly neighborhood small business? In
some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because
you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have
cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a
soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a
minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry.

I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who
carries cash anymore? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose
to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over
something that’s clearly a thing of the past?

It was, he indicated to Fox Business, proof that the US is ending “China’s

new rare-earth mineral processing center, Bessent added: “We’re finally

appear to be coming true and the busy upcoming holiday season should be normal
for travel, experts say.

That is at least in part because air traffic controllers are quickly returning

Keir Starmer has been warned that Britain’s youth are in danger of becoming a
“lost generation” on his watch as it emerged almost half of all jobs shed
since Labour came to power are among the under-25s.

With the government under fire before the autumn budget, Guardian analysis
shows the dramatic leap in UK unemployment to the highest levels since the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
