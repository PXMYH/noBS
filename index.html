            <p>Deal would have created fifth-largest US carrier but judge said it would harm

Low-cost air carriers JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines canceled their
$3.8bn merger agreement on Monday, seeing no path forward after a US judge
blocked the deal in January on anti-competition concerns.

A successful deal would have created the fifth-largest carrier in the United
States and helped Spirit ensure its survival, but the deal had been on the
ropes ever since a Boston judge said it would harm consumers by reducing
competition.

  *  **US markets close at record highs as enthusiasm for AI drives gains**

There seems to be a bizarre disconnect between the surging US stock market and
the sad state of American politics. Winston Churchill supposedly quipped,
“Americans always do the right thing, after they have tried everything else.”
But in light of the impending rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in
this year’s US presidential election, Churchill’s observation needs adjusting:
Americans, apparently, do the right thing only after they have tried
everything else _twice_.

What explains this disconnect between the stock market’s buoyancy and the
crisis facing American democracy? The market may simply believe that the US
president has limited influence over the domestic economy, at least in the
short term. Or perhaps investors believe that artificial intelligence conquers
all.

The world is off track to meet its climate goals and the public is to blame,
Darren Woods, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, has claimed – prompting
a backlash from climate experts.

As the world’s largest investor-owned oil company, Exxon is among the top
contributors to global planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions. But in an
interview, published on Tuesday, Woods argued that big oil is not primarily
responsible for the climate crisis.

            <p>Sixty years after fatal floods and subsidence halted gas extraction in the Po
delta region, politicians are once again eyeing methane reserves. But at what
cost to one of the Mediterranean’s largest wetlands and the people who live
there?

To a visitor driving through Polesine in north-east Italy on a winter morning,
the area might seem blessed with an abundance of wildlife. The biodiversity is
among the richest in Italy, with 400 species of bird, lagoons, marshes and
reed beds that have created a true natural labyrinth. Yet, it soon becomes
obvious that something is not right: houses and fields are all lower than the
road, visibly sunken, protected by embankments about four metres high. The
reason? Without those barriers, they would be under water.

the deal’s biggest beneficiaries, a Guardian analysis suggests.

The tax cuts passed the House of Representatives at the end of January as part

of the child tax credit. The Senate could vote on the bill over the coming

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Diversity-focused groups outline concerns in letter to Fortune 500 companies
amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
