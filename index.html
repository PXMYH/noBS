            <p>Chevron Corp. won its arbitration battle with Exxon Mobil Corp. and has closed
its $53 billion deal to buy Hess Corp. more than 20 months after the takeover
was announced. The decision is a major victory for Chevron, ending a period of
strategic limbo that hurt its stock and prompted questions over the quality of
the company’s due diligence when it agreed to buy Hess in October 2023.
Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said he would walk away from the
deal if they lost the case. “This creates a premier international and oil and
gas company,” Wirth said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.

Chevron closed its $55bn acquisition of Hess on Friday after winning a
landmark legal battle against its larger rival Exxon Mobil to gain access to
the largest oil discovery in decades.

The strategy of Chevron’s CEO, Mike Wirth, to turn around his company’s
lagging performance hinged on the acquisition, one of the largest energy deals
in the past decade. The prize is a stake in the prolific Stabroek Block off
the coast of Guyana that holds more than 11bn barrels of oil and is one of the
fastest-growing oil provinces in the world.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

The parties did not disclose details of the settlement and defense lawyers did

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the
immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.

sugar cane in its US drinks, as it does in Mexico and the UK.

“I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the
United States, and they have agreed to do so. I’d like to thank all of those
in authority at Coca-Cola,” Trump said in a social media post late Tuesday.

            <p>Texas has long been under threat from the launches and explosions of SpaceX

The north-west Hawaiian island of Mokumanamana is said to be touched by the
gods. Bisected by the Tropic of Cancer latitude line, it is deep in the
Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs
give way to indigo blue waters dotted with monk seals and stony coral. No
humans have lived on Mokumanamana, but it has the world’s highest density of
ancient Hawaiian religious sites.

“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the
darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of
Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes,
their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up
to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re
met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can
pass into _pō_ and be with their ancestors, who inhabit the Pacific waters
west of Mokumanamana.

With concerns mounting about the extent to which European companies may be

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
