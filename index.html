The US healthcare system faces a “perfect storm”, more than 100 members of
Congress warn today, as Donald Trump’s administration risks exacerbating
pressure on its workforce by stripping nearly one million US immigrants of
work authorization and legal protection.

YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5m to settle a suit brought by Donald Trump in
2021 that alleged the platform wrongly suspended his channel after the January
6 attack on the US Capitol. The Google subsidiary is the latest in a long
string of tech companies to make a multimillion-dollar payout to the president
over past decisions about his accounts.

Trump had filed the suit against YouTube and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai,
alleging that the platform had “accumulated an unprecedented concentration of
power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse”.
YouTube said it suspended Trump’s channel because it had violated the
website’s policies against inciting violence. Because of the settlement, the
case is now dismissed. Google did not immediately return a request for
comment.

Donald Trump has a lot of questions about the official government statistics
these days. And while his skepticism of bad numbers may look cynical and
political, there are reasons to look at the numbers cautiously.

According to some reports, staffing shortages “have forced the US federal

quit as part of the latest wave of its deferred resignation program.

With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
