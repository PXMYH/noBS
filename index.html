US experience, to reverse the company&#39;s slump in the US market due to an aging
lineup, model delays, and pricing blunders. Filosa faces significant
challenges, including President Donald Trump&#39;s tariff moves, increasing
competition from Chinese manufacturers, and the need to set a clear strategy
to move the company forward, particularly in North America where shipments
cratered 20% in the first quarter. Filosa must address issues such as
rebuilding quality, margins, and volumes, as well as mounting challenges in
Europe, where Stellantis is contending with high energy and labor costs, muted
sales, and increased competition. Bloomberg Intelligence&#39;s Steve Man reports.

immigration policies change rapidly, farmers and workers alike are uncertain
about their future.

 **Ouch! Germany’s economy is on track for its worst performance in post-war
history, a new report shows.**

The **German** **Chamber** **of** **Commerce** **and** **Industry** ( **DIHK**
) predicted this morning that Europe’s largest economy will contract by 0.3%
this year, _Reuters reports_. That would be the third annual contraction in a
row, although not as bad as the 0.5% fall in GDP which the **DIHK** predicted
back in February.

“A mood of cautious relief is spreading after the long weekend, amid hopes for
more fruitful trade negotiations between the United States and its global
partners. There are no post bank holiday blues for the London market, with the
Footsie in striking distance of the record high reached in February. More
positive vibes are pulsing about the outlook for the global economy, with
hopes that more scores can be etched on the doors of trade talks.

“US futures point to a higher open on indices, as optimism spreads after the
holiday break. Trump once again has pressed the pause button, this time on

As a Republican state lawmaker for 16 years, a Texas rancher and a staunch
supporter of Donald Trump, John Davis’s conservative credentials are
impeccable. But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an
increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US –
clean energy development.

Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling

opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is
one of the poorest counties in Texas.

Donald Trump wants to “dictate” policies like those of far-right regimes in
the 1930s, a leading billionaire investor has warned.

Ray Dalio writes in a new book that the US president is acting like a chief
executive without a board as he seeks to expand executive power even more

Drastic cuts at a federal workplace safety research agency increase the risk

public health emergencies, fired employees warn.

The Trump administration ordered widespread layoffs at the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, inside the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, when it issued a “reduction in force” notice to some 85% of the
agency’s 1,100 workers employees on 1 April.

The owners of the multibillion-pound James Bond franchise have requested more
time to mount their defence to keep control of the super spy’s name in Europe,
after a legal challenge to their trademark rights across a range of goods and
services.

In February, the Guardian revealed that a Dubai-based property developer had
filed claims in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various
protections had lapsed around James Bond’s intellectual property, including
his name, his 007 assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Instead of cutting taxes on the richest Americans – who hold much of the
country’s debt – simply raise them

On Friday, the credit rating of the United States was downgraded. Moody’s, the
ratings firm, announced that the government’s rising debt levels would grow
further if the Trump Republican package of new tax cuts were enacted. This
makes lending to the US riskier.

Moody’s is the third of the three major credit-rating agencies to downgrade
the credit rating of the United States.

They’ll pay even _more_ interest on the growing debt – to the super-rich.

They’ll pay higher interest rates on all other long-term debt. (As higher
rates on treasury bonds waft through the economy, they raise borrowing costs
on everything from mortgages to auto loans.)

The debt crisis will give Republicans even more excuse to do what they’re
always wanting to do: slash safety nets. So many Americans could lose benefits
they rely on, such as Medicaid and food stamps.

Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy
emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. He is a Guardian US
columnist. His newsletter is at robertreich.substack.com

for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
