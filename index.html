New York City’s financial watchdog is raising the alarm about the Trump
administration’s cull of a key federal agency that oversees consumer financial
protection laws, warning it will usher in an “open season” for fraudsters.

Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller and a candidate for the city’s
mayoral race, said the uprooting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) will leave many Americans vulnerable to scams and predatory lending as
the federal agency’s oversight and regulatory powers have been significantly
diminished. Lander is calling on state and local governments to make up for
the gap in oversight.

            <p>The unpredictability of the US president’s tariff policy on Mexico has already
cost ranchers millions in profit losses

Bandannas veiled ranchers’ mouths and noses, shielding them from heavy dust
clouds kicked up by the Mexican herds of cattle crossing the United States-
Mexico border. The scene looks timeless, routine. The uncertainty isn’t.

In Donald Trump’s first 100 days, the borderland’s cattle industry faces a
huge challenge: threats of a trade war that’s already hitting consumers in the

producers with mounting economic losses.

When Garrett Petters, a 29-year-old architect in Dallas, and his girlfriend
travelled to Paris last year, one of their favourite parts was eating out.
They enjoyed French duck, andouillette, plenty of bread, cheese and coffee and
even escargot.

But it wasn’t just Paris’s cuisine they admired. It was also the different
tipping culture. “We were talking about how nice it is in Europe that they pay
their waiters and waitresses and we don’t have to tip because of it, and isn’t

Sydney businessman Robert Jarmyn had a $250,000 shipment of skincare products
en route to the US from China when Donald Trump declared his new tariffs

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true

high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprising the Port of
Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the
shipping world and an economic driver of California’s huge economy. The
busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world,
approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock,
moving billions of dollars’ worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts,
toys, clothes and furniture.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
