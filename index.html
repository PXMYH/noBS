            <p>The company has lost much of its value after market scepticism about startups’
prospects

The future of the British brand Zapp looked promising as its top team gathered
around one of its electric mopeds and stared up at a billboard bearing its
logo close to Times Square, New York, in May. They threw their arms aloft as
they marked the six-year-old company’s listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange,
in a deal valuing it at $573m (£467m). Another billboard declared: “Simply
Electric. No compromise.” On social media, Zapp wrote: “All excited and ready
for the next chapter! Live life unplugged.”

Six months on, the stock has hit the skids, and now has a market cap of
$12.5m, according to the Nasdaq, and Zapp looks increasingly like it will join
a host of British vehicle companies which have seen their US listing turn into
an investors’ short stay car park.

Every year, millions of individuals and small business owners have their tax
returns prepared by outside accountants. It makes sense. Taxes can be
complicated so it’s a good idea to have someone who knows this stuff well – a
professional – to do your year-end reporting, and do it right.

But let’s say there’s a problem with your tax return. Maybe your tax
professional made a mistake. Or was negligent. Or wasn’t up to date on the
rules. And let’s say this problem resulted in you owing more money to the IRS.
Or even – if serious enough – it results in the IRS taking you to court. Who’s
ultimately responsible for this problem? Is it your accountant?

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>After four months, the Sag-Aftra film and television union has reached a
tentative deal, but we may be waiting a while for the art itself to triumph

It’s over. The stream of sweatshirted and placard-wielding Instagram no-
filter/no-makeup posts from stars is at an end. The Sag-Aftra film and
television actors’ strike in Hollywood is paused after four months, with a
tentative deal giving actors larger minimum-pay increases, a streaming bonus
and “consent and compensation” provisions against AI, although how exactly
this last is to be enforced remains to be seen. For those who had thought of
Hollywood as the very epitome of free-marketeerism, the spectacle of an actual
strike, which remained reasonably popular and un-demonised in the press, and
which produced a result, is quite startling. Especially as British Equity
doesn’t have this kind of power.  
  
In the movies themselves, from Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront to Sylvester
Stallone in FIST to Peter Sellers’ Hitler-moustached shop steward Fred Kite in
I’m All Right Jack, there is a long tradition of showing unions and union
activity as dramatically compromised. The closing scene of Sergei Eisenstein’s
Strike shows the workers being collectively shot, interspersed with images of
a cow being slaughtered. But today’s Hollywood cow is in pretty good shape,
despite rumours that studios have been using the strike as a cover to make
production cuts.  
  
But what does it mean for the moviegoing public? Well, not perhaps all that
much immediately, unlike the writers’ strike in the US where talkshows were
suspended and Drew Barrymore was criticised for breaking the strike by
attempting to restart her show. Production can reportedly recommence on titles
such as Deadpool 3, Gladiator 2 and Wicked which had been stymied, and a
release can be scheduled for delayed films including Dune: Part Two – but the
unblocking of all these sequels and adaptations does not on the face of it
seem like a reflowering of creativity or “storytelling” which industry honchos
solemnly declare to be their vocation.  
  
Striking Hollywood actors had been forbidden to make promotional appearances,
which had meant not appearing on talkshows. Perhaps British TV audiences for
The Graham Norton Show or The Jonathan Ross Show might not have noticed any
great difference, but we have seen a greater emphasis on non-film-promo
celebrity turns: Arnold Schwarzenegger has been around to boost his self-help
book and Dame Judi Dench her work on Shakespeare. And we have been spared that
most depressing of phenomena – the group appearance, whereby three or four
people from the same film sit grinningly on the sofa and hog all the limelight
and turn the programme into an advertorial for their film.  
  
But during the strike, Hollywood stars had been allowed to put their heads
over the parapet on the understanding that they were doing so as producers,
and film festival selectors had reportedly gone easier on movie stars’
“passion projects” on the understanding that they would be allowed to make a
red-carpet appearance as producers. This was surely the case with Chris Pine
and his wacky, sub-Lebowski film Poolman this year, in which he was director,
star, co-writer and co-producer – and which had people at the London film
festival groaning and checking the time on their phones. The strike had given
oxygen to Chris Pine and Poolman which should maybe have been withheld. The
end of the strike will mean business (almost) as usual: streamers and studios
will have drawn in their horns; performers will be encouraged to stay in their
lanes, but with the knowledge that this is still a really lucrative industry –
and actors have triumphantly restaked their claim in it.

Optus is scrambling to regain public support after Wednesday’s 14-hour outage
by offering “eligible” customers a free data pack, as it faces a Senate
inquiry and separate government review.

The telco giant’s network dropped out from about 4am on Wednesday, leaving
millions of customers including hospitals, schools, financial institutions and
government departments unable to make or receive calls for at least nine
hours.

“I don’t recall,” Ivanka Trump repeatedly told a New York court on Wednesday
as she took the witness stand at her father’s $250m fraud trial and was
quizzed about deals prosecutors claim prove the Trump Organization knowingly
misled lenders.

Trump’s eldest daughter gave an orderly, calm performance after the often
chaotic testimony of her father and brothers. She pointed out that she had not
worked for the family firm since 2017 and said she did not recall many
specific conversations but added: “I have no reason to doubt it.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
