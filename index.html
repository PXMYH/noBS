The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday said it had issued a

movement on certain Boeing 737 airplanes.

Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said more than 40
foreign operators of Boeing 737 airplanes may be using Max or 737 Next
Generation planes with rudder components that could pose safety risks.

Even though the vast majority of US labor unions have endorsed Kamala Harris,
many union members support Donald Trump, and with the race so close, unions
have stepped up efforts to convince those workers that Trump is no friend of
unions or workers.

In Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – states that Harris badly needs to
win – union households are an important voting bloc, and unions have mobilized
thousands of members to engage in worksite conversations, door-knocking and
phone-banking to make the case that Harris is far better for workers than
Trump.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Lawsuits allege platform’s ‘dopamine-inducing’ algorithm can lead to anxiety,
depression and body dysmorphia

More than a dozen states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against
TikTok on Tuesday, alleging the popular short-form video app is damaging
children’s mental health with a product designed to be used compulsively and
excessively.

The lawsuits stem from a national investigation into TikTok, which was
launched in March 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from
several states, including California, Kentucky and New Jersey. All of the
complaints were filed in state courts and claim that TikTok’s algorithm is
especially dangerous given the platform’s widespread use among young people
and its ability to deliver quick hits of dopamine. Design choices such as
infinite scrolling, push notifications and in-app purchases prey on youth and
create addictive habits among users, prosecutors allege. There are over 170m
monthly active TikTok users in the US, and over a billion worldwide.

A Choice analysis of carmaker privacy policies has found some of the biggest
car sellers in Australia collect and share a range of driver data, including
in some cases video and biometric data, with third parties.

The consumer group analysed the privacy policies of Toyota, Ford, MG, Mazda,
Kia, Hyundai, Tesla, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi to determine the extent that
modern vehicles are collecting data on their customers, as vehicles become
more and more digital.

Tesla’s Cybertruck is too big and sharp for European roads, transport
campaigners have warned, as questions are raised about the registration of one
of the first of the electric pickup trucks to hit the continent.

There had been confusion about whether the Cybertruck could be driven in
Europe, owing to strict road safety rules that ban sharp edges and require
speed limiters on vehicles that weigh more than 3.5 tonnes when full. Tesla’s
manual lists the angular steel vehicle as having a gross vehicle weight of 4
tonnes. (The equivalent of a standard family car, such as a Ford Focus, is 1.9
tonnes.)

            <p>Some states are moving to ban ‘proposition bets’, a type of side wager, but
big firms are lobbying against it

College athletes are facing “significant abuse” amid a surge in harassment
unleashed by America’s gambling boom, according to US sports officials who say
students are increasingly subject to death threats, harassment and demands for
money.

A handful of state regulators have moved to ban legal gambling platforms from
offering certain types of bets on collegiate sports as a result of the
“inherently problematic” surge in harassment of college athletes online, at
venues and in dorms.

the bustle of tourists on the Vegas strip. Front yards have small pebbles
instead of grass, and signs that welcome the start of autumn seem premature in
the sweltering heat.

Andrew Clarke knocks on the door of a ranch-style house. A dog barks
aggressively from inside. “Hi, my name’s Andrew. I’m an organizer with For Our
Future Nevada. Is Jennifer available?” Clarke asks in an upbeat voice. The
voice says Jennifer doesn’t live there any more.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
