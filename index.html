            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>BoE insists that monetary policy must remain restrictive for ‘an extended
period’, after money markets anticipated five rate cuts in 2024

  *  **Bank of England holds rates at 5.25% as it gives inflation warning**
  * Markets bet on UK interest rate cuts in 2024 amid recession risk
  * Dow closes at record high after Fed signals it will cut interest rates in 2024

 **Switzerland’s central bank has left interest rates on hold this morning.**

The Swiss National Bank voted to maintain its policy rate unchanged at 1.75%,
saying that while inflationary pressure has decreased slightly there is still
high uncertainty.

The SNB will therefore continue to monitor the development of inflation
closely, and will adjust its monetary policy if necessary to ensure inflation
remains within the range consistent with price stability over the medium term

Today we get the outcomes of the ECB and Bank of England policy meetings.

While both will follow the Federal Reserve in leaving rates unchanged, don’t
expect President Lagarde and Governor Bailey to follow Chair Powell in opening
the door wide open to sizable and early rate cuts in 2024 -- and this despite
the weaker economies in both jurisdictions relative to the US.

BP has formally dismissed its chief executive Bernard Looney with immediate

“serious misconduct” relating to his past relationships with colleagues.

Looney stepped down from his post in September after admitting he had failed
to fully disclose a series of personal relationships with his colleagues to
the board.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The streaming platform has shared its most in-depth look at what their many
subscribers have been watching

In news that will excite anyone who spent a substantial chunk of their youth
poring over the purple “Life” section of USA Today for Nielsen ratings and box
office reports, Netflix has released a large chunk of its often-secret
viewership data. The streaming service has long displayed shifting top 10
lists on its homepage, showing what’s currently most watched among their film
and TV offerings. But this new data dump is an 18,000-row spreadsheet
cataloging data for just about any movie or TV show over the course of January
through June of this year.

So what, exactly, are the biggest shows and movies on Netflix? Many of the
most popular shows feature or are aimed at young women. Anyone with access to
social media or a Hot Topic will probably know that Wednesday, the service’s
Addams Family-as-YA reboot, is a huge success; less merchandised but similarly
high up the Netflix charts are Ginny &amp; Georgia (essentially Netflix’s in-house
Gilmore Girls), Outer Banks (a teen mystery series), Firefly Lane (a decades-
spanning drama of female friendship), and the Korean drama series Crash Course
in Romance. There’s also plenty of escapist action-adventure fare, like FUBAR
(a father-daughter action-comedy with Arnold Schwarzenegger that plays a bit
like a True Lies sequel) and the limited series Kaleidoscope (a time-scrambled
heist drama whose episodes can be watched in any order); plus more serious
action-intrigue like The Night Agent (the most-watched Netflix Thing for this
entire six-month period) and The Diplomat (with Keri Russell as a newly
appointed US ambassador).

open to ‘foreseeable misuse’

Tesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted with its
Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new safeguards, after a
safety regulator said the system was open to “foreseeable misuse”.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been
investigating the electric automaker led by the billionaire Elon Musk for more
than two years over whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay
attention when using the driver assistance system.

Urgent action is needed to prevent record debt repayments by the world’s
poorest countries developing into a full-blown crisis, the World Bank has
warned.

The Washington-based multilateral body said the escalating cost of servicing
past borrowing caused by rising interest rates was siphoning money away from
spending on health, education and tackling the climate crisis.

A pair of thieves from Colorado had a bold argument for why they should get a
lesser charge: the items they stole were on sale.

Michael Green, 50, and Byron Bolden, 37, were formally sentenced this month
after receiving convictions for retail theft at a Kohl’s department store in
Parker, Colorado. The department store dubbed the pair the “KitchenAid Mixer
Crew” due to their alleged association with other retail thefts.

            <p>More than 2 million clients used tooth-straightening service that advertised
itself as faster and cheaper than braces

Audrey Ganus was running late for her SmileDirectClub appointment on Monday,
so she called from the car to let a receptionist know that she might show up
five minutes past her appointment time. When she heard an automated voicemail
say that the company had shut down and was no longer offering services, she
assumed the phone number had changed – she’d received a confirmation email
just two days beforehand. But when she arrived at the office, she saw the
doors were locked, the lights were off, and items were “scattered everywhere”
inside, as if workers had left in a hurry.

Things got worse when Ganus, who is 22 and lives in Palm Harbor, Florida,
tried to log on to her patient portal. “I was supposed to have records of
everything: my retainers, 3D scans of my teeth, progress reports,” Ganus said.
“There’s nothing. Now I don’t even have any proof that I’ve ever had my smile
straightened. No other doctor is willing to help me without that proof, so the
only way I can get help is if I start all over again, and have my teeth
straightened for three, four or five thousand dollars. SmileDirectClub left me
with no options, and I’m freaking out a bit.”

territory, say prosecutors

Russia’s farmers are achieving record grain harvests – according to official
figures. But the numbers published by Vladimir Putin’s government appear to
conceal the contribution to this bumper crop made by another set of farmers:
those in occupied Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials and agriculture experts have claimed that favourable
conditions are not enough to explain the giant harvest. They say instead that
Ukrainian grain is being exported disguised as Russian produce.

            <p>Experts advise the city’s first AAPI female bookstore owner on a plan to
reopen Yu &amp; Me Books in its original location in Chinatown

For Lucy Yu, who runs what’s believed to be New York City’s first Asian
American woman-owned bookstore, losing her brick-and-mortar business was akin
to losing a child. But since 4 July of this year, when a blaze engulfed the
Chinatown building that housed Yu &amp; Me Books, the 29-year-old has had little
time to process her grief.

Within hours of the blaze, she shifted into rebuild mode: right after
firefighters brought the fire under control, Yu and a friend ran into the
store and hauled inventory into plastic bags and tarps. They salvaged a couple
thousand books from the wreckage, just under half of the collection. The
effort left Yu coughing and short of breath for the next two weeks.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
