Covid-19 pandemic, allowing people across the globe to compete and connect

In a report sent late on Thursday, Institutional Shareholder Services also

for director Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk’s brother, and for the company’s proposed
move to change its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware.

New Environmental Protection Agency rules aim to crack down on toxic air
pollution from US steelmakers by limiting pollutants such as mercury, benzene
and lead that have long poisoned the air in neighborhoods surrounding the
plants.

The rules target contaminants released by steel facilities’ coke ovens. Gas
from the ovens creates an individual cancer risk in the air around steel
plants of 50 in 1,000,000, which public health advocates say is dangerous for
children and people with underlying health problems.

election day approaches, the Guardian is dispatching reporters to key swing
counties to gauge how they are feeling – and how they might vote._

On a recent Friday night in San Jose, California, a small group of Spanish-
speaking renters sat in the clubhouse of their apartment complex wondering
whether the room was bugged. “Let them listen,” said a young man, with a
dismissive gesture.

They were meeting to strategize about forming a tenants’ association to
bargain collectively with their large corporate landlord. Along one wall of
the room hung large white posters with the names and unit numbers of residents
and their yes-or-no response to a survey about their willingness to
participate in a rent strike.

            <p>Service members are more likely than the general public to become problem
gamblers, but screening – and help – is lacking

Dave Yeager didn’t join the US army to become a pathological gambler. But
after re-enlisting as a food inspection specialist in the wake of 9/11, Yeager
arrived at his base hotel in Seoul, Korea, feeling overwhelmed and restless.
“I’m walking around and find a casino-style slot machine room,” says the
57-year-old former sergeant. “As soon as I sat down, the first thing I noticed
was that my shoulders started to relax. Then I won, and it was like a dopamine
hit. In that moment, all of the fear and anger and stress that I was feeling
just went away.”

Suddenly and without warning, a night of gambling here and there became a
seven-day-a-week addiction – one that had him phoning home for more money,
pawning personal effects and stealing from his unit. When a demotion in rank
failed to curb Yeager’s reckless behavior, his bosses threw up their hands.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.
