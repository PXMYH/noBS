            <p>Exclusive: Massachusetts senator said credit checks in hiring
disproportionately affect people of color and women

As the US labor market comes under pressure, two senior figures in Washington
are pushing to end a practice that prevents large swaths of US workers from
obtaining jobs.

A bill reintroduced today by Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts,
and Steve Cohen, the representative from Tennessee, bans employers from using
credit checks to vet potential hires.

            <p>Our tipping culture was in place long before Trump, but his ‘no tax on tips’
promise – now law – is enabling it

I’m here in Las Vegas for a conference where I just paid $7 for a cup of
coffee and then was shamed into tipping another $1 to the server for pouring
the coffee and handing it to me. Welcome to America. I feel like I’m tipping
for everything, everywhere. And now it’s only going to get worse. And for that
I blame President Trump.

Of course, our tipping culture was in place long before Trump took office. But
now that his “no tax on tips” promise became law, our government is officially
enabling it. That’s good news for tipped workers and for small-business owners

enough gratuities. But at the same time, it’s bad news for the rest of us who
will likely feel even more obligated than ever to tip.

speaking about the flavours packed by some of this year’s “special” apples.

Indeed Butterfield, the owner of Sandford Orchards, near Exeter, is buying

            <p>Document appears to undermine claim from Donald Trump allies that Cook
committed mortgage fraud

A loan estimate for an Atlanta home purchased by Lisa Cook, the Federal
Reserve governor accused of mortgage fraud by the Trump administration, shows
that Cook had declared the property as a “vacation home”, according to a
document reviewed by Reuters.

The document, dated 28 May 2021, was issued to Cook by her credit union in the
weeks before she completed the purchase and shows that she had told the lender
that the Atlanta property would not be her primary residence. The document
appears to counter other documentation that Cook’s critics have cited in
support of their claims that she committed mortgage fraud by reporting two
different homes as her primary residence, two independent real-estate experts
said.

            <p>Recent data shows stagflation, stagnant growth and price inflation, is
possible as economy shaken by uncertainty

It’s a strange time for the US economy. Prices are rising, jobs growth has
stalled, uncertainty is everywhere and stock markets have soared to record
highs. Against this background a scary word last used in the 1970s is being
uttered again: stagflation.

Stagflation is the term that describes “stagnant” growth combined with
“inflation” of prices. It means that companies are producing and hiring less,
but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be
worse than a recession.

finances

The Fitch agency downgraded France’s credit rating on Friday, as President
Emmanuel Macron struggles with political instability and disagreements on how
to put the country’s strained public finances in order.

The US rating agency, one of the top global institutions gauging the financial
solidity of sovereign borrowers, downgraded France on its ability to pay back
debts, from “AA-” to “A+”, the country’s lowest level on record at a major
credit rating agency.

amid rising meat culture

Plant-based burgers were supposed to help wean Americans off their
environmentally ruinous appetite for meat. But sales have plummeted amid a
surging pro-meat trend embraced by the Trump administration, raising a key
question – will vegetarianism ever take hold in the US?

This year has been a punishing one for the plant-based meat sector, led by
companies such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, with sales of refrigerated
products slumping 17%. This follows a difficult 2024, during which sales fell
7%, furthering a multi-year spiral – last year Americans purchased 75m fewer
units of plant-based meat than they did in 2022.

China’s government has vowed to “firmly protect” its interests against
Mexico’s plan to increase tariffs on Chinese cars to 50%, a move Beijing said
was made “under coercion to constrain China”.

On Wednesday Mexico said it intended to raise tariffs on car imports from
China and other Asian countries from 20% to 50%, the maximum level allowed, in
order to protect tens of thousands of manufacturing and industry jobs. However
analysts suggested it was also designed to placate Donald Trump, who has been
pressuring Mexico not to act as a “back door” for Chinese goods into the US.

            <p>Tycoon who briefly surpassed Elon Musk is a friend of Trump, owner of Hawaiian

Larry Ellison, co-founder of the software company Oracle, is having a good
year. His friend Donald Trump is in the White House, his son David Ellison has
taken over the storied media company CBS, and on Wednesday he surpassed his
buddy Elon Musk to win the title of the “world’s richest man”.

Oracle’s stock went wild with the news, pushing his fortune even higher.
Ellison’s net worth shot up to $393bn, surpassing Musk’s $384bn – although, by
the time markets closed on Wednesday, Musk was back ahead.
