Iva Walsh, a single mother of four who immigrated to the US from the Czech

to provide work opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Her roster of nine employees includes her 26-year-old daughter, after whom the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The source of new renewable energy is also a battleground over China’s cheap
exports of panels that has split US firms

The Biden administration touts solar energy as one of its big success stories,
a booming new industry that is curbing the effects of the climate crisis and
creating high-paying jobs across the country. But the more complicated truth
is that the United States is mired in a long-running trade war with China,
which is flooding the market with artificially cheap solar panels that carry
an uncomfortably large carbon footprint and threaten to obliterate the
domestic industry.

The price of solar panels has plummeted 50% over the past year, largely,
industry insiders say, because of deliberate Chinese overproduction of key
components and a game of international cat-and-mouse over trade rules often
likened to a game of “Whac-A-Mole”. As different sets of rules get
established, Chinese companies have proved adept at moving their manufacturing
plants to other countries, in south-east Asia, and shifting strategies to work
around US tariffs and other deterrent measures.

Staff workers formed the UAW Staff United union last March. It covers UAW

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said the government will impose an
as-yet-undefined ban on younger teenagers and children from accessing social
media before the next election.

On Tuesday, Albanese announced the plan to introduce legislation into
parliament by the end of 2024 to block children from social media and other
digital platforms unless they are over a certain age – likely to be between 14
and 16. It will come after the $6.5m trial of age verification or assurance
technology funded in May’s budget.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Experts are issuing stern warnings about business support for Trump – it could
backfire badly and endanger democracy

From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, a growing number of billionaires, tech
titans and venture capitalists are backing Donald Trump’s campaign for
president, among them Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone, the world’s
largest private-equity fund, Steve Wynn, the casino tycoon, Bill Ackman, the
hedge fund manager, and Marc Andreessen, a leading venture capitalist.

But many business school professors and historians are issuing stern warnings
about this business support for Trump, saying that backing him could backfire
badly for business and endanger America’s democracy. These professors caution
that corporate America – along with everyone else – should be hugely concerned
about a candidate who has talked of being a dictator on day one, terminating
the constitution, and weaponizing the justice department to exact revenge
against his critics.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
