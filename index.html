A Campbell’s Soup Company executive has been put on temporary leave after he

The lawsuit was filed last Thursday in Wayne county circuit court in Michigan
by Robert Garza, who had joined Campbell’s New Jersey headquarters remotely in
September 2024 as a security analyst. Garza alleges he was fired in January
after he raised concerns about comments made by Martin Bally, Campbell’s vice-

Meta to disgorge profits, pay penalties and agree to cease running such

            <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say
they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their
contacts

Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution
offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant,
ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most
Admired Companies by the magazine, describes its financial advisers as “expert
listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after
goal”.

It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes
it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that
could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file
into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month
internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in
beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent
graduates themselves.

holiday prices are volatile, economists say

If you feel like the price of Thanksgiving this year is more expensive to
gobble up, you’re not alone. Amid widening concerns about the rising cost of
living, polls show consumers are increasingly worried about inflation.

Economists say the picture for holiday food prices this year is more mixed –
prices are volatile and depend largely on how families shop around for their
feast.

  * Business live – latest updates

BHP has walked away from another attempt to take over rival miner Anglo
American after it was again rebuffed, failing in a last-minute effort to
disrupt the planned merger with Canadian mining business Teck Resources.

The Australian mining company reportedly became interested in making another
offer for FTSE 100-listed Anglo last week, more than a year after abandoning a
£39bn attempt to buy the business.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

            <p>Critics are concerned that Daniel Suhr, the head of a conservative legal
group, may be pulling the strings behind many of the Trump FCC’s moves

In just 14 months, Daniel Suhr, the 40-year-old president of a two-person,
Chicago-based, conservative legal organization called the Center for American
Rights, has emerged as a thorn in the side of the major US broadcast news
networks at a time when they face both financial and political
vulnerabilities.

Suhr has had a key ally in Brendan Carr, who was hand-picked by Donald Trump
to serve as the chair of the powerful Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
as the Trump administration has sought new avenues to take on the mainstream
media. Carr has resuscitated several complaints that were filed by Suhr and
dismissed at the end of Joe Biden’s administration and has seemingly factored
in Suhr’s suggestions when reviewing media mergers.

Calling plant-based food veggie “burgers” or “sausages” may be banned in the
UK under the new trade agreement with the EU, the Guardian understands.

The Labour government secured a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) agreement
with the EU earlier this year, which allows British businesses to sell
products including some burgers and sausages in the EU for the first time
since Brexit.

China has suspended imports of Japanese seafood again, as the fallout over the

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
