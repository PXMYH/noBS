industry with little to produce this year

For decades it was the signature taste of Florida: orange juice from the
state’s plentiful groves advertised to a thirsty nation as “your daily dose of
sunshine”. But now another hyperactive hurricane season, paired with the
dogged persistence of an untreatable tree disease known as greening, has left
a once-thriving citrus industry on life support.

Only 12m boxes of oranges will have been produced in Florida by the end of
this year, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecasts show, the lowest
single-year yield in almost a century. The figure is 33% lower than a year
ago, and less than 5% of the 2004 harvest of 242m boxes.

A public health crisis is rapidly taking hold, Congress has been warned, with
“all available evidence” pointing to an increase in problems surrounding
America’s gambling boom.

Sports betting, now legal in 38 states, has exploded across the US over the
past six years. Campaigners and clinicians say addiction levels have grown
during this surge, with young people among those affected. Athletes and
sporting officials say harassment has risen, too.

With Christmas less than a week away, thousands of Amazon warehouse workers
across the countries are on strike after the company refused to start contract
negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

Though it’s been well over two years since the first Amazon warehouse union
was formed in New York City, and workers at several other warehouses across
the country have started to unionize, the company has refused to recognize and
negotiate a contract with the union.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The eurozone’s flaws and a lack of growth in the EU have combined to malign
effect. ‘More Europe’ is not the solution

Things are not quite going according to plan for Rachel Reeves. The economy
has contracted for the past two months and inflation is proving hard to shift.
The first Labour budget in more than 14 years received a frosty reception. But
everything is relative; at least the chancellor had no trouble getting her
measures through parliament, which is more than can be said for Emmanuel
Macron in France. And if opposition MPs at Westminster were to call a vote of
no confidence, Labour’s massive majority means it would be spared the defeat
suffered by Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, earlier this week.

In Germany and France, support is growing for parties of the hard right and
the hard left, and it is not difficult to see why. A crisis that affected
countries on the periphery of the 20-nation eurozone 15 years ago – Greece,
Portugal and Ireland – has now worked its way to the core of the single
currency zone. Let’s be clear: France is not the new Greece. The European
Central Bank would probably step in to buy French bonds in the event of a
full-scale speculative attack, and is now better equipped to do so than during
the last crisis.

Arguably, no country in Asia has better reason to be in a state of anxiety
over the return of Donald Trump to the White House than Japan, since the US
has been the linchpin of Japanese foreign and security policy since the second
world war.

Back in 2017, well before he became prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba described
Trump’s method as one of “placing his counterpart in a state of anxiety and
tension, creating psychological instability and then initiating a deal”.

            <p>Trade can help protect species – and real skins are often more sustainable
than synthetic alternatives, say conservationists

Conservation experts have criticised a decision by London fashion week to ban
exotic animal skins from its 2025 shows as “ridiculous”, warning that it is
ill-informed and could harm the protection of many snakes, crocodiles and
reptile species.

Last month, the British Fashion Council’s deputy director for policy and
engagement, David Leigh-Pemberton, told parliament that next year’s fashion
shows would prohibit the use of skins from alligators, snakes and other
animals. In a statement, the council said the ban was part of a wider range of
standards to promote sustainable practices in the fashion industry.

A year after the murder of George Floyd, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart had a
warning for corporate America. The death of Floyd triggered a wave of protest
over systemic racism and was “not an isolated event. We have a long history of
racism, and we see unacceptable events continue.”

Walmart and other large US corporations made pledges to address inequities
within their business, ones many feared would be dropped once the focus on
Floyd’s killing and its aftermath faded. “We can’t let that be the case,” he
wrote, outlining how the company was releasing its “diversity metrics twice a
year” and calling on companies to “continue to address systemic racism and the
structural inequities that are rooted in this nation’s history of slavery and
that persist today”.

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

reviving speculation of another round of government intervention. Even after
the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March for the first time since 2007
and again in July, the gap in borrowing costs in Japan and the US is weighing
on the currency. Expectations that the Federal Reserve would trim rates less
aggressively than previously thought in 2025 have contributed to the weakness.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.
