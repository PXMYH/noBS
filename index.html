            <p>With tipping reported at self-checkouts, drive-throughs and even vending
machines, some consumers are pushing back

When Garrett Petters, a 29-year-old architect in Dallas, and his girlfriend
travelled to Paris last year, one of their favourite parts was eating out.
They enjoyed French duck, andouillette, plenty of bread, cheese and coffee and
even escargot.

But it wasn’t just Paris’s cuisine they admired. It was also the different
tipping culture. “We were talking about how nice it is in Europe that they pay

that cool,” Petters said. It felt very different from back in the US, where
tipping culture felt “out of control”.

Charlotte Young Bowens was 48 years old and 48 miles into a 50-mile
ultramarathon when suddenly she slumped to her knees and collapsed to the
ground, emotionally and physically exhausted. Curled into the fetal position,
she began crying harder than she had in years.

She wondered if she could finish. She rolled over on her back, looked up at
the sky and thought back to a dark period in her life, when she was clinically

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
