 **UK trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds has also called for reforms of the
WTO, including changes to the much criticised dispute resolutions system which
can also take years to settle disputes between trading nations.**

 **Reynolds** told the **European** **Policy** **Centre** security conference
in Brussels:

“We do recognise that reforming and repositioning the WTO so that it can
respond more effectively to the challenges of today is the only way to
safeguard long term stability and growth tomorrow.

“Our eyes are fixed on greater flexibility in decision making, greater
openness in the east of plurilaterals and building a fully functioning dispute
settlement system,”

“the trees that survive the storms aren’t the tallest. They’re the ones whose
roots are intertwined with their lives.

“Just in the past two days, during the OECD trade ministerial [summit] the
message was clear and unequivocal – deep reform of the World Trade
Organisation is long overdue and urgently needed to match today’s realities.”

“We negotiate. We do not isolate. We do not leave the table… trade agreements
are more than transactions. They are upgrades that empower our partners,
helping them grow with us and creating a cycle of shared prosperity.”

The US supreme court made it easier on Thursday for people from majority

workplace “reverse discrimination”, reviving the case of an Ohio woman who
claimed that she did not get a promotion at a state agency because she is
heterosexual.

The justices, in a 9-0 ruling, threw out a lower court‘s decision rejecting a
civil rights lawsuit by the plaintiff, Marlean Ames, against her employer,
Ohio’s department of youth services.

            <p>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:48:24 CDT</p>
            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Tide detergent and Pampers maker plans global restructuring as US
consumers pull back and trade costs rise

Procter &amp; Gamble will cut up to 7,000 jobs, or approximately 6% of its global
workforce, in the next two years as the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers
diapers wrestles with tariff-related costs and customers who have grown
anxious about the economy.  
  
The job cuts, announced at the Deutsche Bank consumer conference in Paris on
Thursday, make up about 15% of its current non-manufacturing workforce, said
chief financial officer Andre Schulten.  
  
“This restructuring program is an important step toward ensuring our ability
to deliver our long-term algorithm over the coming two to three years,”
Schulten said. “It does not, however, remove the near-term challenges that we
currently face.”  
  
Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, had approximately 108,000 employees
worldwide in June 2024.  
  
The cuts are part of a broader restructuring program. Procter &amp; Gamble will
also end sales of some of its products in certain markets. Procter &amp; Gamble
said it will provide more details about that in July.  
  
Like many companies, Procter &amp; Gamble is dealing with American consumers who
are worrying about their spending as they keep an eye on inflation.  
  
US consumer sentiment fell slightly in May for the fifth straight month,
surprising economists. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s
closely watched consumer sentiment index declined 2.7% on a monthly basis to
50.8, the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. The
only lower reading was in June 2022. Since January, sentiment has tumbled
nearly 30%.  
  
And on Wednesday the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis that
said Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8trn in a
10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and
reducing the purchasing power of households overall.  
  
Baked into the CBO analysis is a prediction that households would ultimately
buy less from countries hit with added tariffs. The budget office estimates
that the tariffs would increase the average annual rate of inflation by 0.4
percentage points in 2025 and 2026.  
  
In April Procter &amp; Gamble noted during a conference call that the biggest US
tariff impacts were coming from raw and packaging materials and some finished
product sourced from China. The company said that it would be looking at
sourcing options and productivity improvements to mitigate the tariff impact,
but that it may also have to raise prices on some products.  
  
That same month, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents big food
companies like Coca-Cola and General Mills as well as consumer product makers
like Procter &amp; Gamble, warned that although its businesses make most of their
goods in the US, they now face tariffs on critical ingredients – like wood
pulp for toilet paper or cinnamon – that must be imported because of domestic
scarcity.

            <p>Fortunate timing and government hesitation allowed the Switch 2 to come out on
time, but the headache isn’t over

Nintendo fans across the US are breathing a sigh of relief as they tear apart
the boxes housing their new Nintendo Switch 2 video game consoles. On-again,
off-again trade tariffs implemented by Donald Trump, which precipitated pre-
order delays from Nintendo, made the 5June release date of the highly coveted
hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up
from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers’ fears did not come to
fruition.

Nintendo’s maneuvering around Trump’s tariffs isn’t over, though – far from
it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely
within a 90-day tariff pause issued by the president. If tariffs on countries
like India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump’s “Liberation
Day” speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to
limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
