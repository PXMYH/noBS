brought forward spending while suppliers are holding back from price
increases. Demand stayed strong in the quarter, co-Chairman Steve Conine said
on a call Thursday, adding that the company’s seeing suppliers “actually
trying to not raise price or to defer it as long as possible and do the
minimum that they would need to do.” The online furniture retailer reported
adjusted earnings per share of 10 cents in a statement, beating the average
analyst estimate calling for a loss of 20 cents. Consumers “likely sought
items ahead of anticipated price increases due to tariffs,” according to
Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Poonam Goyal and Sydney Goodman. (Source:

and trade that may cause consumers to pull back on spending. The world’s

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Apple Inc.’s sales from China declined more than anticipated in the latest
quarter, overshadowing otherwise solid results for the iPhone maker. Revenue
from the country fell 2.3% to $16 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which
ended March 29, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had
estimated $16.83 billion. Overall sales gained 5% to $95.4 billion, ahead of
the $94.6 billion average estimate. Apple had projected percentage growth in
the low- to mid-single digits.The shortfall in China is an ominous sign for
what was once a growth market. Apple has lost ground to local phone brands,
such as Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo, and the government there banned foreign-made
technology from some workplaces. Apple’s China-centric production also makes
it especially vulnerable to tariffs announced by the Trump administration.
Apple is struggling in artificial intelligence as well, especially in China.

The EU’s strategy to secure its own supply of microchips is “deeply
disconnected from reality”, a damning report by the official European court of
auditors (ECA) has found.

The ECA reported that the bloc was “very unlikely” to meet its 2030 target of
supplying 20% of the world’s microchips at a time when global demand for
semiconductors is booming to meet the growing needs of defence, green tech and
artificial intelligence.

            <p>In Kansas, Panasonic and two community colleges scaled up training fast. But
jobs in the EV industry could be affected by Trump’s war on clean energy

In a Kansas City classroom, 20 students were learning how basic circuit boards
work. They fiddled with knobs, switches, levers and wires; if they got the
connections right, tiny light bulbs glowed.

The students, recruited for the opportunity by Panasonic, were participants in
an eight-week apprenticeship course that involved classes at the community
college and on-the-job training. When they’re done, they will be among the
first workers at the company’s new electric vehicle battery factory in nearby
De Soto, Kansas. The $4bn manufacturing plant – touted as the largest EV
battery factory in the world – is expected to open in early summer and
eventually employ roughly 4,000 people. Panasonic also paid for the students’
tuition, as well as the instructor’s salary.

            <p>Filming in Los Angeles is at a historic low, with some suggesting the city

When screenwriter David Scarpa visits the great Hollywood studios these days,
he is struck by what is missing. “It used to be you’d walk around those back
lots and you’d see many people and they were very busy,” Scarpa muses. “They
were like small cities. Now often you’ll walk around and have nobody else
there. It feels empty. You definitely feel the absence of life on those lots.”

Like the once proud industrial factories of the midwest, the dream factories
of southern California are in decline. Last year was the worst for on-location
filming in Los Angeles since tracking began 30 years ago apart from pandemic-
hit 2020. Of all the TV shows and feature films that North American audiences
watch, only one-fifth are now made in California.

Xi Jinping has announced a plan to counter China’s continuing economic
problems and the impact of the US trade war, as reports swirl that it could
drop tariffs on some US products, including semiconductors.

Friday’s meeting of the politburo was convened to discuss China’s economy,
which since the pandemic has faced difficulties fuelled by a housing sector
crisis, youth unemployment and Donald Trump’s tariffs on all Chinese imports
to the US.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
