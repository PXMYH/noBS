The US labor market continued to grow in February even as threats of mass
layoffs in the federal government and uncertainty around Donald Trump’s tariff
policies rattle the US economy.

In February, 151,000 jobs were added to the economy, up from an adjusted
125,000 jobs gained in January. The unemployment rate was 4.1%, little changed
from 4% in January. Economists had been expecting 170,000 new jobs to be added
over the month.

            <p>Trump, Musk and Doge are making cuts – here’s what we know about the current
government size and demographics

Tens of thousands of US federal employees could lose their jobs after the
Trump administration moves to reduce the size of the federal workforce
dramatically.

With Elon Musk at the helm of the so-called “department of government
efficiency” (Doge), which is overseeing efforts to cull federal employment,
the White House has embarked on multiple plans to cut down on virtually all
areas of federal employment. There are no official numbers of how many federal
employees will be affected, and many of Donald Trump and Musk’s efforts have
been stalled in court, but the impact could be big and long-lasting.

            <p>World’s richest man has spent years trying to get Starlink into the fast-
growing economy. It could serve as a beachhead for his other business
ambitions in India

It is easy to believe that Elon Musk’s reach knows no limits. But while the
world’s richest man may control a space satellite empire, own one of the
largest social media platforms, produce the world’s bestselling electric car,
and have been given carte blanche by Donald Trump to gut the US government,
there is one market that Musk has yet to properly crack: India.

Now, with his newfound influence over the Trump administration and global
geopolitics, it appears likely that Musk’s entrance into the Indian market,
both with his Tesla electric cars and his Starlink satellite internet, may
come smoother and faster than expected.

  * Business live – German debt ‘bazooka’ rallies stocks and euro

European financial markets have rallied sharply and German borrowing costs
have soared after the country’s prospective leaders announced a historic deal
to loosen its “debt brake” rule to boost spending on defence.

The yield – in effect the interest rate – on 30-year German government bonds
rose by about 25 basis points to 3.08% in its biggest daily increase since
October 1998.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Trump administration’s tariffs have sparked tension with co-hosts Canada
and Mexico. That’s bad news for a tournament that is supposed to unite nations

The start of the run-up to a World Cup is traditionally an upbeat affair. New
stadium launches, inclusion-friendly marketing and merch campaigns, the
unveiling of a tournament song or quirky mascot: these are the traditional
signals by which host nations announce that the big show is approaching. This
time, pre-tournament preparations are taking shape a little differently.
Thanks to Donald Trump and his determination to pursue economic armageddon
against the US’s co-hosts, Canada and Mexico, the tone for the 2026 World Cup
is being set not by Shakira or an anthropomorphic keffiyeh but by reciprocal
tariffs, a flurry of cross-border insults, and crumbling diplomatic relations
between the host nations. On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that the US will begin
imposing levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico; Canada immediately
retaliated, and Mexico looks set to follow. Welcome to the Trade War World
Cup; please tip your host 25% of the entrance fee on your way in. If things
continue on their current course, the 2026 tournament will be the first
installment of the World Cup to be co-hosted by the antagonists of an active
international economic conflict.

Whether things do in fact continue as they are is, of course, difficult to
predict: Trump’s approach to policy is famously erratic, and the protectionism
that marked his first administration was leavened by various exemptions and
carve-outs to the tariffs imposed on trading partners, a cycle of aggression
and moderation that could be repeated this time round. With the first match
still 15 months away, there’s plenty of time for the deterioration in
diplomatic relations between the co-hosts to give way to reconciliation. But
as things stand today, with Trump and his cabinet lackeys apparently hellbent
on trashing the global economy and humiliating traditional allies, that hope
seems pretty remote. The US – which is due to host 75% of the matches during
the 2026 tournament, and every fixture from the quarter-finals onwards – looks
set to steam into the approaching World Cup with a spirit of hospitality
roughly equivalent to Roy Keane sizing up Alf-Inge Haaland’s knee.

            <p>Bruce and Nancy Steele had a business that produced honey for the past 30
years before the Eaton fire destroyed it

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the
California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert:
watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner,
was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures
included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a
threadbare T-shirt from Occidental College, the school where Bruce and Nancy
first met – and where he would go on to work for more than 35 years.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
