            <p>As Europe scrambles to build out its long-neglected military capabilities,
valuations for defense companies have soared. But, a historically low-volume
industry, defense now faces a huge task in scaling up production, which calls
not only for massive investments, but also building out a whole ecosystem.
Germany&#39;s RENK is a key part of that ecosystem - it sits at the center of the
tank supply chain, building engines &amp; transmissions for tanks that are used
across the world&#39;s militaries. The company went public in February &amp; expects
high growth over the coming years, but many questions on funding, order flows
&amp; scaling up remain as the company&#39;s CEO, Susanne Wiegand explains. (Source:

justice department told a federal judge on Tuesday.

It is now up to the justice department to decide whether to file charges

small black pigs roam through a barn and donkeys graze in fields bordered by

It is a bucolic way of life in Green Township, but one that Brock and many of

A leading professor of corporate governance has accused Tesla of threatening
to fire one of its law firms over his objections to Elon Musk’s claim to a
massive $56bn compensation package.

Retired professor Charles Elson of the University of Delaware alleged in a
legal filing on Monday that Holland &amp; Knight, a law firm that he has worked
for over close to three decades, told him that Tesla threatened to end its
relationship with the firm unless he dropped plans to submit a legal brief to
a shareholder lawsuit opposing the controversial payout, the largest in US
history.

  * Nils Pratley: Anglo American’s breakup is overdue

South Africa has backed Anglo American’s plan to sell the famous diamond
business De Beers as part of a historic corporate overhaul to defend the
company against a £34bn takeover plot.

The embattled London-listed mining company set out a radical new strategy to

The Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder has urged MPs

Browder, who became a prominent campaigner after his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky,

war”, and help shift the burden from taxpayers to businesses and individuals
subject to sanctions.

            <p>United Auto Workers union sees two of German-owned carmaker’s plants as key in
effort to unionize industry in southern US

The United Auto Workers (UAW) union is setting its sights on its next big
union victory in the south, at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Vance and
Woodstock, Alabama.

Coming off the historic union election win at the Volkswagen plant in
Chattanooga, Tennessee, 5,200 workers are to begin voting in their union
election from 13 May to 17 May. The UAW’s recent win at Volkswagen to
represent about 4,300 workers was one of the biggest union election wins in
manufacturing in the past 16 years.

            <p>The Nobel-winning US economist’s championing of government intervention to
nullify neoliberal excesses is ardently expressed but unconvincing

In 2009, the American government loaned almost half a billion dollars to Elon
Musk’s Tesla corporation to hasten the development of electric car technology.
What did it think it was playing at? Didn’t it remember what Ronald Reagan
said? “The most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the
government and I’m here to help,’” the late president told a 1986 press
conference.

For Reagan and the brains behind his neoliberal puppet, the role of government
is to get out of the way and let the unfettered orgy of self-interested
neoliberal economic life express itself as nature intended. Taxation is theft
and interventionist industrial policy always a mistake, except when it
involves bailing out failing banks in reward for tanking the economy.

            <p>Experts say Biden can win back working-class Americans if he hammers home the
message that he is helping them on pocketbook issues

To the dismay of Democrats, blue-collar voters have lined up increasingly
behind Donald Trump, but political experts say Joe Biden can still turn things
around with that large and pivotal group by campaigning hard on “kitchen
table” economic issues.

With just six months to go until the election, recent polls show that Trump
has stronger support among blue-collar Americans than he did in 2020. But
several political analysts told the Guardian that Biden can bring back enough
of those voters to win if he hammers home the message that he is helping
Americans on pocketbook issues – for instance, by canceling student debt and
cutting insulin prices.

Target confirmed Friday that it won’t carry Pride Month merchandise at all

sales over its collection honoring LGBTQ+ communities.

Target, which operates roughly 2,000 stores, said decisions about where to
stock Pride-themed products, including adult apparel, home goods, foods and
beverages, would be based on “guest insights and consumer research”.

            <p>As brick-and-mortar retail stores compete with e-commerce, chains are spending
heavily to immerse customers in bespoke fragrances

When Dallas Pratt worked at an outpost of Aesop in an outdoor shopping mall
outside Chicago, one of her and her co-workers’ favorite ways of drawing in
new customers was making a concoction they called “sidewalk tea”. They would
put a few drops of scented lotion in a cup of hot water, and then they would
pour it on to the slab of concrete outside the shop. As the water evaporated,
the smell of the lotion would fill the air.

“It drew people in,” Pratt tells me. “They asked questions. They spent time.”
And, crucially, they bought stuff.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
