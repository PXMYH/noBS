Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against the man accused of

hotel on 4 December, the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Tuesday.

Bondi said in a press release that she had “directed federal prosecutors to
seek the death penalty” for Luigi Mangione, 26, because he allegedly committed
“a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”. The move,
Bondi notes, was in an effort to “carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop
violent crime and Make America Safe Again”.

National home prices hit a new peak in March as February’s rate cut reignited
buyer demand, according to separate reports from Australia’s leading property

automation: it’s nice that computers have made some boring things in our lives

I side with the writer and philosopher John Gray, who in his terrifying work
of eco-nihilism Straw Dogs balances the fact that human beings are a plague
animal who are wrecking the biosphere that supports them with the idea that we
have made our lives easier through technology. Gray, in particular, calls

            <p>Elliott Ingram was stunned at how a thief made off with his Ioniq 5 deploying
a device to mimic the smart key – and says he should have been warned

The motor manufacturer Hyundai faces legal action over allegations it failed
to warn its customers that one of its most popular models of electric cars
could be stolen “effortlessly in seconds”. Elliott Ingram, an expert in
digital security, was stunned when a CCTV camera installed at his home
recorded a hooded thief stealing his Hyundai Ioniq 5 car in less than 20
seconds.

The thief is believed to have used a device, available online, to mimic the
car’s electronic key. It is the latest in a spate of thefts involving the
vehicle, and many owners now resort to a steering lock. Ingram’s car was later
recovered by police, but he is terminating the lease and seeking compensation
from the motor company. He says the South Korean car giant should have alerted
customers to the security vulnerabilities.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>China wants to protect against the volatility of Trump’s tariffs, and now has
more than a dozen free trade agreements with global south countries

Chinese vice-premier Ding Xuexiang has pledged to give stronger policy support
to the Chinese economy as he delivered the keynote speech at a forum focused
on bolstering the country’s role in Asia and ties with the global south.

With the tariffs on Chinese goods mounting, China is trying to find a
foundation for growth that does not rely on an increasingly capricious United
States. At the Boao Forum for Asia, a conference in south China’s Hainan
province, Chinese officials and academics stressed the need for partnerships
with global south countries. Despite its rapid economic growth in the past
three decades, China still identifies as being part of this group.

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
