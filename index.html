If Chinese carmakers are to be believed, a lot of people really love karaoke.
Those people love karaoke so much that they want it in their family car.

This was not something the European mind could comprehend a few years ago,
according to Volkswagen’s chief financial officer, Arno Antlitz. Yet the
technology, included in electric cars sold by China’s BYD and Xpeng, is just
one example of the lessons that Volkswagen and its European counterparts have
had to learn as they scramble to keep up with Chinese rivals on track to
dominate the global electric car market.

Colorado oil and gas companies have pumped at least 30m lbs of secret
chemicals into the ground over the past 18 months without making legally
required disclosures, according to a new analysis.

That’s in spite of first-in-the-nation rules requiring operators and their
suppliers to list all chemicals used in drilling and extraction, while also
banning any use of Pfas “forever chemicals” at oil and gas sites. Since the
transparency law took effect in July 2023, operators have fracked 1,114 sites
across the state, but as of 1 May chemical disclosures have not been filed for
675 of them – more than 60% of the total, the analysis says.

Hollywood’s actors’ union filed an unfair labor practice charge against Epic
Games on Monday, alleging the company replaced actors’ work by using
artificial intelligence to generate Darth Vader’s voice in Fortnite without
notice.

The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
said Llama Productions, a subsidiary of the gaming giant, “failed and refused
to bargain in good faith with the union” in the last six months. The company
made unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of employment “without
providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain” by using AI-
generated voices to replace bargaining unit work, Sag-Aftra said. Epic Games
did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>As many films struggle to find distribution, Watermelon Pictures has stepped
in to help tell stories from Palestine and other marginalized communities

In March, The Encampments, a documentary on the pro-Palestinian protest
movement on US college campuses, opened at the Angelika Film Center in New
York. The nonfiction theatrical marketplace has never been breezy in the US,
but this is a particularly difficult time for documentaries, let alone films
about hot-button issues considered politically sensitive or, under the new
administration, outright dangerous; one of the Encampments’ primary subjects,
the Columbia University student-activist Mahmoud Khalil, remains in detention
by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) without charge for any crime.
Large-scale distributors, including all of the major streaming services, are
increasingly wary of anything deemed controversial, leaving such films as
Union, on the Amazon Labor Union, or the Oscar-winning Palestinian-Israeli
documentary No Other Land without distribution in the US.

Nevertheless, over an exclusive first-weekend run, The Encampments made
$80,000 at the Angelika – the highest per-screen average for a documentary
since the Oscar-winning Free Solo in 2018. That number may sound like peanuts
compared with, say, the multimillion theatrical haul of a Marvel movie, but
it’s a significant win for the specialty box office – and validation for a
film whose mere existence, as a pro-Palestinian narrative, led to threats of
violence at the Angelika, an incident of vandalism in the theater’s lobby and
social media censorship of its ads.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
