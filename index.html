            <p>Ex-Alameda CEO and ex-girlfriend of fallen crypto mogul pleaded guilty, but
prosecutors signalled lenient sentence

Caroline Ellison, the former crypto executive and romantic partner of the
disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, is slated to be sentenced in
Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. Ellison was a central figure in the FTX
bankruptcy saga and key witness for the prosecution in the $8bn fraud trial
that ended with Bankman-Fried’s conviction.

Ellison served as the CEO of Alameda Research, which was the trading arm of
the now defunct FTX crypto exchange. The collapse of FTX, once valued at
$32bn, was directly linked to revelations that it was attempting to
financially prop up Alameda with fraudulent accounting. Subsequent
investigations and criminal charges found that both FTX and the hedge fund had
used billions in customer funds for risky trades and lavish personal spending.

The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has said he expects

union rights and human rights in a report published on Monday by the
International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC).

Amazon, Tesla, Meta, ExxonMobil, Blackstone, Vanguard and Glencore are the

Wednesday, the first decrease in four years. It’s a moment that many
economists see as the end of an era, and the beginning of the end of the
central bank’s fight against inflation.

The Fed’s prime rate – used to set the rates on everything from mortgages to
car loans – has sat at a 20-year high for the last year, making it more
expensive to borrow money.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
