“further disciplinary action”.

struggling with the cost of living crisis.

Cornwall Insight, a respected industry consultant, has forecast that average
bills will fall by 16% on the previous quarter, and could reach their lowest
since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            <p>Wild freshwater eels are at risk of extinction due to overfishing but their
meat can now be cultivated from cells

The first lab-grown freshwater eel meat has been produced, potentially solving
a diner’s dilemma. Rampant overfishing has caused eel populations to plummet
and prices to soar, but the cultivated eel could provide the delicacy guilt-
free.

The eel meat was produced by Forsea Foods in Israel from embryonic cells of a
freshwater eel. The company collaborated with a Japanese chef to create unagi
kabayaki, marinated grilled eel over rice, and unagi nigiri, a type of sushi.

This article was corrected on 22 January 2024. A previous version said the eel
meat was produced from embryonic cells of the Japanese unagi eel: in fact they
were from a freshwater eel.

The Republican primaries are under way and – not surprisingly – the candidates
have been ganging up on Bidenomics. Spoiler alert: they don’t like it. Fact
check: they are wrong.

To a man – and one woman – the Republican candidates all say that the US
economy is bad and that Americans are struggling financially. They’re warning
about sky-high deficits, over-the-top government spending and a potentially
catastrophic level of national debt. They point out that interest rates are at
a 20-year high and the costs of core things like food, gas and housing are
significantly more than they were just a few years ago. They point to a
downturn in manufacturing and falling small business confidence.

            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
