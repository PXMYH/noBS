Traditionally, visitors to Kyoto in October come for _momijigari_ , the
turning of the autumn leaves in the city’s picturesque parks. This autumn,
however, there is a new draw: a Nintendo museum.

The new attraction, which opens on Wednesday, is best described as a chapel of
video game nostalgia. Upstairs, Nintendo’s many video game consoles, from
1983’s Famicom through 1996’s Nintendo 64 to 2017’s Switch, are displayed
reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can
also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese
company’s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a
_hanafuda_ __ playing card manufacturer in 1889. Downstairs, there are
interactive exhibits with comically gigantic controllers and floor-projected
playing cards.

            <p>The league has ended its resistance to institutional capital. The Premier
League has shown the chaos and rot that the relationship can bring

The last of the holdouts has fallen. A few weeks ago, the National Football
League passed a resolution to allow private equity investment in individual
teams, thereby bringing to an end to the league’s long resistance to the
incursion of institutional capital. The NFL joins the National Basketball
Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and Major League
Soccer, all of which have opened up to institutional investment in recent
years. Only one of the league’s 32 owners, the Cincinnati Bengals’ Mike Brown,
voted against the proposal – a decision, reports suggest, born of his
longstanding desire to maintain the financial viability of smaller franchises
in a league where growth in team valuations and media revenues shows no sign
of slowing down.

The effects of the new ownership regime will be minimal, for now at least. The
NFL will not be transformed overnight from a league in which teams are owned
by wealthy individuals and families and managed for the benefit of fans and
communities to one run according to the whims of private equity’s bullies and
money grubbers. But it seems hard to imagine that a shift of this nature won’t
take shape eventually. The league has been careful to limit the initial scope
of private equity investment in the league: individual funds can buy no more
than 10% in a given franchise; will acquire purely passive stakes, stripped of
any decision-making, governance or voting rights; and will have to hold on to
their investments for at least six years. Only four participating funds are
allowed to invest for now; they are all long-dated (meaning they generally
have long investment horizons and are not, in theory, looking to generate
quick returns) and have a lot of money to burn. Sovereign wealth funds, asset
management firms, endowments, and pension funds are barred from investing in
the league – a marked contrast to the NBA, which opened up to this bigger
class of investors in 2022.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Jeffrey L Bowman’s Reframe consultancy is using artificial intelligence to
help with engaging employees with diversity programming or making a budget for
DEI work

With its focus on remedying historical and economic inequities, DEI has become
an unassailable component of American life. The ideological framework – more
formally known as diversity, equity and inclusion – is now a standard element
of how businesses are run and students are taught. (It’s also become a
weaponized term, as was the case when a New York Post column said that Kamala
Harris would be a “DEI president”.)

Nearly $350bn flowed into DEI and racial justice initiatives during the two
years following the 2020 murder George Floyd, according to a report by
McKinsey. The DEI industry – mostly consultants whose work focuses on helping
organizations review and revise their spending, recruiting and hiring
practices – is worth close to $10bn. But over the past few years, DEI programs
have been dramatically downsized. Universities such as Harvard and MIT are now
scrapping mandatory DEI statements and companies ranging from Nordstrom to
Salesforce are slashing related budgets and staffing targets.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
