            <p>UK food producers plan more protests over inheritance tax changes ahead of
this week’s NFU conference in London

The suits and black cabs which typically dot the streets around Westminster
have been frequently replaced by the wellies, tweed jackets and tractors of
aggrieved farmers of late. The next protest in London by the nation’s food
producers is expected on Tuesday morning, ahead of the annual get-together of
the National Farmers’ Union (NFU).

Farmers have regularly swapped their fields for the city since October, when

            <p>US consumer debt is high and rising but 16 cents on every dollar spent by the
government is now going to interest

A recent report from the Federal Reserve warned that consumer debt is now more
than $18tn and the people are worried. Americans’ “credit card and household
debt reach all-time high”, reports Fox News. Consumers are “finding it harder
and harder to pay off their debt”, claims CNN. A “third of Americans have more
credit card debt than emergency savings”, says Marketplace.

Yes, consumer debt has ticked up this year. It’s true that some consumer debt
– particularly student loans – has soared in the past few years. But –
although worrisome – this debt is still being used to fund education and
skills. Other consumer debts are being used to buy homes and cars and fund the
purchases that make life livable, not to mention the many industries that rely
on this spending.

and a close friend and ­collaborator of the late Steve Jobs, says he still
often asks himself: “I wonder what Steve would do?”

Ive told BBC Radio 4’s _Desert Island Discs_ on Sunday that he does so despite
the fact that Jobs had specifically told him not to before his death in 2011,
aged 56.

As Ukrainians prepare to enter their fourth year dealing with the harsh daily
realities of life during conflict with Russia, few will be musing on the
comparative economic health of the warring nations. However, inflation figures
released either side of the border showed the continued toll the conflict has
had on citizens of both countries – with price rises running at 9.5% in Russia
and 12% in Ukraine.

Three years on since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, economists are
examining the relative health of each country.

            <p>An explosive succession trial and an astonishing interview with one of
Rupert’s sons have exposed the paranoia and hatred at the heart of global
media’s most powerful family. This could get messy…

When some of the mind games and manoeuvres that turned a Murdoch family
“retreat” into an ordeal appeared in _Succession_, the TV drama about
squabbling family members of a right-wing media company, members of the real-
life family started to suspect each other of leaking details to the writers.
The truth was more straightforward. _Succession_ ’s creator, Jesse Armstrong,
said that his team hadn’t needed inside sources – they had simply read press
reports.

Future screenwriters have been gifted a whole load of new Murdoch material in
the past few days, after two astonishing stories in the _New York Times_ and
the _Atlantic_ lifted the lid on the dysfunction, paranoia and despair at the
heart of the most powerful family in global media.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
