            <p>Seine-Port is introducing restrictions on phone use in streets, shops and
parks – but young people say there’s little else to do

A picture of a smartphone with a red line through it serves as a warning in
the window of a hairdresser’s shop in a French village that has voted to ban
people scrolling on their phones in public. “Everyone is struggling with too
much screen time,” said Ludivine, a cardiology nurse, as she had her hair cut
into a bob, leaving her phone out of sight in her bag. “I voted in favour,
this could be a solution.”

Seine-Port, in the Seine-et-Marne area south of Paris, with a population of
fewer than 2,000 people, last weekend voted yes in a referendum to restrict
smartphone use in public, banning adults and children from scrolling on their
devices while walking down the street, while sitting with others on a park
bench, while in shops, cafes or eating in restaurants and while parents wait
for their children in front of the school gates. Those who might check their
phone’s map when lost are instead being encouraged to ask for directions.

Meta is considering expanding and “revisiting” its hate speech policy around
the term “Zionist”, the Guardian has confirmed. The company reached out to and
met with more than 10 Arab, Muslim and pro-Palestinian organizations on Friday
to discuss the company’s plans to review the policy to ensure the term
“Zionist” is not being used as a proxy for Jewish or Israeli people, according
to an email the Guardian reviewed.

The policy as it exists allows “Zionist” to be used in “political discourse
but removed when it’s used explicitly as a proxy for Jews or Israelis in a
dehumanizing or violent way”, according to an email a Meta representative sent
to the organizations inviting them to the Friday meeting. The email further
stated the company was considering reviewing it in light of posts users and
“stakeholders” have recently reported, the Meta representative wrote. The
Intercept first reported the potential change in policy.

            <p>Despite healthy sales, publishers such as Epic Games and Activision Blizzard
are making hundreds of employees redundant – which may radically reshape the
industry

It is widely agreed that 2023 was a stellar year for video games. The Legend
of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Baldur’s Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, Marvel’s Spider-
Man 2 … barely a week passed without some blockbuster hit or independent gem.

But beneath these accolades there is a sadder, more worrying story: it was
also a year of widespread industry redundancies, and the trend is continuing
into the opening weeks of 2024. Microsoft laid off 1,900 staff after its $69bn
purchase of Activision Blizzard. Publisher Embracer Group let at least 900
staff go across its many studios, as well as closing veteran UK developer Free
Radical Design. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, one of the most
successful titles of the decade, laid off 830 employees; Electronic Arts shed
6% of its workforce, amounting to approximately 780 jobs. There have been
similar grim stories from Ubisoft, Naughty Dog, Sega and Unity; major
publishers and smaller studios alike are being affected.

For the first time, this year’s Super Bowl will take place in Las Vegas. And
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is aware that a gambling mecca and pro sports
teams could be a dangerous mixture: he issued a memo in the run-up to Sunday’s

project on Great Nicobar Island, warning it would be “a death sentence” for
the Shompen hunter-gatherer people who live there.

The $9bn (£7bn) port project, planned to transform the Indian Ocean island of
8,000 inhabitants into what has been called the “Hong Kong of India”, includes
the construction of an international shipping terminal, airport, power plant,
military base and industrial park. It will also develop tourism.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
