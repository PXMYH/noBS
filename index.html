            <p>The Nobel-winning US economist’s championing of government intervention to
nullify neoliberal excesses is ardently expressed but unconvincing

In 2009, the American government loaned almost half a billion dollars to Elon
Musk’s Tesla corporation to hasten the development of electric car technology.
What did it think it was playing at? Didn’t it remember what Ronald Reagan
said? “The most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the
government and I’m here to help,’” the late president told a 1986 press
conference.

For Reagan and the brains behind his neoliberal puppet, the role of government
is to get out of the way and let the unfettered orgy of self-interested
neoliberal economic life express itself as nature intended. Taxation is theft
and interventionist industrial policy always a mistake, except when it

            <p>President likely to add sectors such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar
cells to range of levies set up under Donald Trump

Joe Biden is expected as early as next week to announce fresh tariffs on
Chinese trade, with levies focused on strategic sectors including electric
vehicles, in a review of measures first put into place under Donald Trump.

An announcement planned for Tuesday will keep the blanket tax rises introduced
by the president’s predecessor but supplement them with targeted levies on
industries connected to EVs, including batteries and solar cells, according to
reports.

            <p>Exclusive: fraudsters impersonated WPP’s CEO using a fake WhatsApp account, a
voice clone and YouTube footage used in a virtual meet

The head of the world’s biggest advertising group was the target of an
elaborate deepfake scam that involved an artificial intelligence voice clone.
The CEO of WPP, Mark Read, detailed the attempted fraud in a recent email to
leadership, warning others at the company to look out for calls claiming to be
from top executives.

Fraudsters created a WhatsApp account with a publicly available image of Read
and used it to set up a Microsoft Teams meeting that appeared to be with him
and another senior WPP executive, according to the email obtained by the
Guardian. During the meeting, the impostors deployed a voice clone of the
executive as well as YouTube footage of them. The scammers impersonated Read
off-camera using the meeting’s chat window. The scam, which was unsuccessful,
targeted an “agency leader”, asking them to set up a new business in an
attempt to solicit money and personal details.

Biden’s environmental regulations and prevent any new ones, according to a

According to the Washington Post, the former US president made his jaw-

Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, said last year that the path
of interest rates was likely to mirror the shape of South Africa’s Table
Mountain: steep-sided but with a plateau at the summit.

Judging by the Bank’s latest monetary policy report, Pill and the other eight
members of Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) are now only
a few short steps from starting their descent from the mountain top. But they
are not quite there yet.

the country’s work-till-you-drop culture.

Qu Jing, who is also vice-president at the company, said she would not take
responsibility for her staff’s wellbeing “as I’m not your mother” in the
videos posted over the May bank holiday on Douyin, the most popular short-
video app in China. In another she said: “If you work in public relations,

Santiago Paredes, who worked for Spirit AeroSystems in Kansas between 2010 and

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
