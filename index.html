his potential replacements for the central banker nor did he lay out a
timeline for a decision. Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026. In Brussels,

Trump may fast-track his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The moves
followed a Wall Street Journal report that Trump may announce Jerome Powell’s
replacement as soon as September, an unusually early appointment. The Fed
unveiled plans to roll back an important capital rule that big banks have said
limits their ability to hold more Treasuries and Shell said it has no

A New York bankruptcy judge approved a disclosure statement last week laying
out Purdue Pharma’s proposed reorganization plan – despite an objection
alleging the disclosure omits information about the US government’s plan to
seize Purdue money that could be used to compensate prescription opioid
victims under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act instead.

It’s been five years since Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to charges of
conspiracy in a New Jersey federal court, including for unlawfully dispensing
opioid products without a legitimate medical purpose. In a press release at
the time, the Department of Justice emphasized that the convictions were part
of a strategy to defeat the opioid crisis.

Randi Weingarten and Lee Saunders quit the Democratic National Committee,
saying it isn’t doing enough to “open the gates” and win back the support of
working-class voters. Ken Martin, the new DNC chair, and his allies told the

that had raised “rider fares and cut driver pay on billions of … trips,
systematically, selectively, and opaquely”.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
