Texas officials have added NatWest Group to a growing list of financial firms
considered to be taking part in a “boycott” of energy companies, in a move
that could limit the UK bank’s business with the oil-rich US state.

The American coffee chain poached the boss of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Brian
Niccol, naming him as its new chief executive this week in a surprise
management shake-up, ousting Laxman Narasimhan from the job after just 17

Meta is struggling with moderating content related to the Israel-Palestine
war, particularly in Hebrew, despite recent changes to internal policies, new
documents have revealed.

Internal policy guidelines shared with the Guardian by a former Meta employee
who worked on content moderation outline a multilayered process for moderating
content related to the conflict. But the documents indicate Meta, which owns
the platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, does not have the same
processes in place to gauge the accuracy of moderation of Hebrew content and
Arabic content.

FBI-ordered raid over filesharing site

Kim Dotcom, who is facing criminal charges relating to the defunct filesharing
website Megaupload, is to be extradited to the US, the New Zealand justice
minister says, which could end more than a decade of legal wrangling.

German-born Dotcom has New Zealand residency and has been fighting extradition
to the US since 2012 after an FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion. The
high court in New Zealand first approved his extradition in 2017, with an
appeal court reaffirming the finding the year after. In 2020, the country’s
supreme court again affirmed the finding but opened the door for a fresh round
of judicial review.

rises

  * Business live – latest updates

Shoppers in Great Britain have faced increased pressure on their budgets in
recent weeks after grocery price inflation rose for the first time since March
last year, returning to the rate before the cost of living crisis.

Supermarket prices were 1.8% higher than a year ago in the four weeks to 4
August, up slightly from 1.6% in July, according to the retail analysts
Kantar. This rise came after 17 months of easing grocery inflation from a peak
of 17.5% to its lowest point since September 2021 last month.

This wasn’t a pop concert or a sports game. It was a marketing event for Walt
Disney, a company with a legion of fans so devoted that about 15,000 were
willing to buy a ticket and come to Anaheim, California, to see its newest
film and TV advertisements first.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
