shutdown in US history, marking the official conclusion to a 43-day impasse.
Trump’s signature means the government can begin to resume normal operations,

growth almost ground to a halt in the third quarter after September’s activity
was hit by a cyberattack on the UK&#39;s largest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover.
Evidence is mounting that consumers and companies are putting off spending

Reeves’ Nov. 26 budget. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The dirt-cheap clothing company has opened its first permanent store in Paris
– and politicians and workers have united against it

Paris is the fashion capital of the world – a paradise of couture and
craftsmanship stretching back centuries. The city’s very name connotes luxury
and glamour. But last Wednesday, 5 November, a sprawling Shein outlet opened
on the sixth floor of the BHV Marais, the historic department store directly
across from Paris’s city hall. It’s the Singapore-based ultra-fast-fashion
store’s first permanent bricks and mortar retail space, and the first of
several permanent outposts Shein plans to open in France in the near future.
Many Parisians aren’t happy about it.

Shein – launched as SheInside in 2011 in Nanjing, China – is the reprehensible
paragon of the ultra-fast-fashion industry. The company sells clothing (and
home goods, toys, stationery, cookware, blankets, pet supplies and more) at an
unfathomable scale: today’s “new in” page alone lists more than 1,300 items,
from shiny gold shirts in its “Manfinity Mode” category, to plunging, plus-
size swimsuits under the sub-brand “Slaysola”. Nearly everything on the site
is made of plastic, designed for single-use disposability, and it’s all
shockingly, disturbingly cheap.

  * US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump has, for years, used legal threats and lawsuits to pressure news
companies who put out coverage he does not like. After his return to power, a
string of US broadcasters and tech firms have paid tens of millions of dollars
to settle such cases.

The president has now gone global with this campaign, crossing the pond to
threaten the BBC with a $1bn lawsuit over an episode of the Panorama
documentary program that aired more than a year ago.

As interventions go it was pretty audacious. The Dutch government decision at
the end of September to take over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chip factory,
almost brought the entire European car industry to a halt.

Tensions between Europe and China de-escalated over the weekend as Beijing
confirmed it would ease restrictions on automotive chip supplies to the EU,
prompting sighs of relief in car factories around the world.

Joy Reid hosted the 7pm hour on MSNBC for nearly five years, providing a daily

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
