            <p>Despite Donald Trump&#39;s surprise 39% export tariffs on Switzerland, the market
reaction so far has been muted says Wolf von Rotberg, Equity Strategist at J
Safra Sarasin. There are a few reasons for this says von Rotberg: There is
still scope for the deal terms to change; tariffs could lead to a depreciation
of the Swiss franc, making export pricing more competitive; and many of
Switzerland&#39;s exports, such as gold and pharmaceuticals, have so far been
excluded from the tariffs. Von Rotberg spoke to Francine Lacqua on &#39;Bloomberg:
The Pulse&#39;. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>President Donald Trump said he would be “substantially raising” the tariff on
Indian exports to the US over the Asian nation’s purchases of Russian oil, a
move New Delhi slammed as unjustified in an escalating fight between the two
major economies. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil,
they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market
for big profits,” Trump wrote on social media Monday. “They don’t care how
many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of
this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA.”
Trump didn’t say by how much he would increase the levy. Last week, he
announced a 25% rate on Indian exports, one of the highest of any major
economy, and vowed more duties if India continued to buy oil from Russia.

chief executive, Elon Musk, after a US court ruled against a previous pay deal
for the world’s richest person.

Musk will pay $2bn to buy 96m shares in the electric carmaker at the same
price per share as a 10-year pay package agreed in 2018, which is stuck in
legal limbo awaiting a court date for an appeal. The award was based on a
recommendation from a “special committee” of the board.

Donald Trump administration officials fanned out on Sunday’s US political

labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer.

The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said Trump had “real concerns”

national economy added 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. Job growth
numbers were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well.

In March 2020, about the time the Covid pandemic started, Christina Chapman, a
woman who lived in Arizona and Minnesota, received a message on LinkedIn
asking her to “be the US face” of a company and help overseas IT workers gain
remote employment.

As working from home became the norm for many people, Chapman was able to find
jobs for the foreign workers at hundreds of US companies, including some in
the Fortune 500, such as Nike; “a premier Silicon Valley technology company”;
and one of the “most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the
world”.

I come from Trinidad and Tobago. As a country that was once colonized by the
British, I am wary of the ways that inequalities between the global north and
global south risk being perpetuated in the digital age.

When we consider the lack of inclusion of the global south in discussions
about artificial intelligence (AI), I think about how this translates to an
eventual lack of economic leverage and geopolitical engagement in this
technology that has captivated academics within the industrialised country I
reside, the United States.

Chaotic and unpredictable, keeping up with Donald Trump’s volatile trade war –
never mind his presidency – can be tough.

Back in April after his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, the talk was of
the president crashing the global economy. Then, after a Wall Street backlash,
the world learned the acronym “Taco”, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens
Out”. Now, things are heating up again.

According to Donald Trump’s White House, the US economy is booming, inflation
is dead and jobs are surging. A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall
on such claims in recent days.

This week’s data on Trump’s early economic record was mixed – good, mad and
ugly – with jobs numbers so weak he reached for the catchphrase he once used
to build himself into a reality TV star: you’re fired.

The danger posed to Donald Trump was obvious. It was a story that not only
drew attention to his links to a convicted sex offender, it also risked
widening a growing wedge between the president and some of his most vociferous
supporters. The White House quickly concluded a full-force response was
required.

It was Tuesday 15 July. The Wall Street Journal had approached Trump’s team,
stating it planned to publish allegations that Trump had composed a crude poem
and doodle as part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th

Donald Trump fired the federal government official in charge of labor

prompting accusations that he is “firing the messenger”.

The US president claimed that Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor
statistics, had “faked” employment figures in the run-up to last year’s
election, in an effort to boost Kamala Harris’s chances of victory.

A growing wave of uncertainty is freezing investment plans in Mexico, the US’s
largest trading partner, rattling domestic and foreign business leaders alike.

Investors are weighing Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on 1 August.
The plan so far – levies on Mexican-made cars, steel, aluminum, metal parts
and tomatoes. And they are pondering the push by the Mexican president,
Claudia Sheinbaum, to overhaul the country’s judiciary in ways critics say
undermine legal certainty and could roll back democratic gains.

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
