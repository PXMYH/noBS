Donald Trump’s new tax bill will add $3.4tn to the national debt over the next
decade, according to new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) released Monday.

Major cuts to Medicaid and the national food stamps program are estimated to

            <p>Report finds that wealth divide widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate
of the whole US over the past decade

Economic inequality has reached a staggering milestone in Silicon Valley: just
nine households hold 15% of the region’s wealth, according to new research
from San Jose State University. A mere 0.1% of residents hold 71% of the tech
hub’s wealth.

The findings come from the 2025 “Silicon Valley Pain Index”, a report
published by SJSU’s Human Rights Institute each year since 2020. The report
aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures
“pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”.

            <p>Newberry Springs was almost lost to the desert. But as America’s ‘mother road’
turns 100, locals see hope that the boom times could return

The tiny desert cafe, caught in a desolate middle between Los Angeles and Las
Vegas, had only been open for five minutes when the first customers of the day
ambled in from the already blistering heat.

It was a Friday morning in June, sand swirling outside across the cracked
street and towards the Bagdad Cafe’s front door. In the same parking lot, a
1950s-era **** sign advertised a motel that no longer exists. In the distance,
only a few surviving businesses remained: a small community center, a veterans

Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that, as a result of the “tougher
environment” in the labor market, companies are “in control again” and are
warning applicants of “long hours and few boundaries”.

At the same time some industries are reporting worker shortages due to Donald
Trump’s immigration crackdown. And then there’s artificial intelligence, which
is about to devastate the jobs market – or is about to create new jobs.

            <p>Call for asset freezes after figures under investigation in Dhaka employed
services of UK law firms and consultants

By the time Bangladesh’s student-led revolution finally toppled Sheikh Hasina,
her security forces had already spilled the blood of hundreds of protesters.

  * Battle over solar as Reform UK attacks net zero

  * How a refinery closure is hitting jobs and politics

  * Why Reform is targeting manufacturing heartlands

“It’s sad. I think it killed the town,” says Debbie, sitting in a cafe in

it would be a costly bid to pass the buck

Memo from the White House: inflation is “right on track”, it declared this
week, citing the latest official data. Price growth is now “very low”,
according to Donald Trump. The actual statistics paint a markedly different
picture.

Just six months after he regained power, in part by promising to rapidly

Chevron closed its $55bn acquisition of Hess on Friday after winning a

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the
immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.

            <p>Spate of incidents in Baltic Sea and around Taiwan are harbinger for further
disruptive activity, cybersecurity firm says

The risk of Russia- and China-backed attacks on undersea cables carrying

the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan, according to a report.

Submarine cables account for 99% of the world’s intercontinental data traffic

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Texas has long been under threat from the launches and explosions of SpaceX
rockets. Now Hawaii is emerging as another possible victim

The north-west Hawaiian island of Mokumanamana is said to be touched by the
gods. Bisected by the Tropic of Cancer latitude line, it is deep in the
Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs
give way to indigo blue waters dotted with monk seals and stony coral. No
humans have lived on Mokumanamana, but it has the world’s highest density of
ancient Hawaiian religious sites.

“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the
darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of
Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes,
their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up
to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re
met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can
pass into _pō_ and be with their ancestors, who inhabit the Pacific waters
west of Mokumanamana.

investigation shows revenues from the GBU-39 bomb **** generated by the US arm
of MBDA flow through the UK

Europe’s largest missiles maker, MBDA, is selling key components for bombs
that have been shipped in their thousands to Israel and used in multiple
airstrikes where research indicates Palestinian children and other civilians
were killed.

With concerns mounting about the extent to which European companies may be
profiting from the devastation of Gaza, a Guardian investigation with the
independent newsrooms Disclose and Follow the Money has examined the supply
chain behind the GBU-39 bomb, and the ways in which it has been deployed
during the conflict.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
