            <p>Museum features consoles from 1983’s Famicom to 2017’s Switch, as well as

Traditionally, visitors to Kyoto in October come for _momijigari_ , the
turning of the autumn leaves in the city’s picturesque parks. This autumn,
however, there is a new draw: a Nintendo museum.

The new attraction, which opens on Wednesday, is best described as a chapel of
video game nostalgia. Upstairs, Nintendo’s many video game consoles, from
1983’s Famicom through 1996’s Nintendo 64 to 2017’s Switch, are displayed
reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can
also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese
company’s pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a
_hanafuda_ __ playing card manufacturer in 1889. Downstairs, there are
interactive exhibits with comically gigantic controllers and floor-projected
playing cards.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The league has ended its resistance to institutional capital. The Premier
League has shown the chaos and rot that the relationship can bring

The last of the holdouts has fallen. A few weeks ago, the National Football
League passed a resolution to allow private equity investment in individual
teams, thereby bringing to an end to the league’s long resistance to the
incursion of institutional capital. The NFL joins the National Basketball
Association, National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and Major League
Soccer, all of which have opened up to institutional investment in recent
years. Only one of the league’s 32 owners, the Cincinnati Bengals’ Mike Brown,
voted against the proposal – a decision, reports suggest, born of his
longstanding desire to maintain the financial viability of smaller franchises
in a league where growth in team valuations and media revenues shows no sign
of slowing down.

The effects of the new ownership regime will be minimal, for now at least. The
NFL will not be transformed overnight from a league in which teams are owned
by wealthy individuals and families and managed for the benefit of fans and
communities to one run according to the whims of private equity’s bullies and
money grubbers. But it seems hard to imagine that a shift of this nature won’t
take shape eventually. The league has been careful to limit the initial scope
of private equity investment in the league: individual funds can buy no more
than 10% in a given franchise; will acquire purely passive stakes, stripped of
any decision-making, governance or voting rights; and will have to hold on to
their investments for at least six years. Only four participating funds are
allowed to invest for now; they are all long-dated (meaning they generally
have long investment horizons and are not, in theory, looking to generate
quick returns) and have a lot of money to burn. Sovereign wealth funds, asset
management firms, endowments, and pension funds are barred from investing in
the league – a marked contrast to the NBA, which opened up to this bigger
class of investors in 2022.

            <p>The future of US Steel hangs in the balance amid a proposed sale to Japan’s
Nippon, which both candidates have vowed to block

The Monongahela River winds through the tight Mon Valley south of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, creating a main artery in the nation’s industrial heart, where
the steel and coal industries have driven the region’s economy and shaped
political landscapes since the late 19th century.

In the weeks preceding the election, the region is once again playing an
outsize role in determining the nation’s political future. A controversial
Biden-Harris administration plan to kill Pittsburgh-based US Steel’s proposed
sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel is viewed in part as an election-year strategy to
shore up critical union support in a must-win swing state.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
