Old people are making news. Just this past week in Denmark, the retirement age
for collecting a government pension was increased to 70 years old, an issue
that has caused much debate in that country. Here in the US, questions have

            <p>Spain’s recent blackout and AI datacentres’ energy needs are leading
politicians to reach for the restart button

When millions of people across the Iberian peninsula were left without power
last month the political fallout ignited debate over Europe’s renewable energy
agenda, and fuelled the rising interest in nuclear power.

            <p>Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian is more confident about demand in the second
half of the year due to price-sensitive passengers in the US showing restraint
in recent months amid a worsening economic climate. Demand should “tick up a
bit” in the period, Bastian said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in
New Delhi on Sunday. That’s after Delta suffered weakness in bookings
predominantly in the US market and among leisure travelers in its main cabin
earlier this year, he said in an interview with Bloomberg&#39;s Guy Johnson.

manufacturing – and movies

If you want a bellwether to measure the broad impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs
on the economy, look south, to Georgia. The political swing state has a $900bn
economy – somewhere between the GDPs of Taiwan and Switzerland.

The hospitality industry is facing an existential crisis. Wine merchants
wonder aloud if they will survive the year. But others, like those in
industrial manufacturing, will carefully argue that well-positioned businesses
will profit. Some say they’re insulated from international competition by the
nature of their industry. Others, like the movie industry, are simply confused
by the proposals that have been raised, and are looking for entirely different
answers. So far, it’s a mixed bag.

            <p>Time and time again over the past four months, reality has failed to match
Trump’s rhetoric

“Tariffs are easy,” Donald Trump claimed in March. For his administration, and
the world, they have proven anything but. Now an obscure New York court has
blocked his signature trade policy, setting up a battle that looks sure to end
up in the supreme court.

The plan was simple. For decades, Trump has made the case for tariffs. Now, in
his second term, he would dramatically hike them on the world; raise trillions

jobs.

Donald Trump announced on Friday he was doubling foreign tariffs on steel
imports to 50%, as the president celebrated a “blockbuster” agreement for
Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel during a rally in Pennsylvania.

Surrounded by men in orange hardhats at a US Steel plant in West Mifflin,
Trump unveiled the new levies, declaring that the dramatic rate increase would
“even further secure the steel industry in the United States”.

            <p>After her former label sold her catalogue in 2019, Swift embarked on her
lucrative album rerecording project – but now owns the originals for the first
time

Taylor Swift has bought back the master recordings to her first six albums,
giving her control over her entire catalogue for the first time. “I almost
stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot
dangled and then yanked away,” she wrote in a letter to fans. “But that’s all
in the past now. All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”

She originally lost the rights in 2019 when her first record label, Big
Machine, sold them to music executive Scooter Braun. Swift described the sale
to Braun as her “worst case scenario”, and said she had not been given the
opportunity to buy her work outright, but to “earn” one album back for each
new album she recorded for the label. Her subsequent albums, from 2019’s Lover
onwards, were released on Republic, with Swift retaining the rights to the
master recordings.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.
