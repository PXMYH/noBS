The founder of General Motors-owned Cruise has stepped down less than a month

loss of permission to operate in California.

Kyle Vogt did not give a reason for his departure from the company that he
started in 2013 before it was bought by the US automotive manufacturer General
Motors in 2016.

When a fire ripped through a car park at Luton airport last month it set off a

quickly doused by the Bedfordshire fire service, which said the blaze appeared
to have started in a diesel car.

Yet the rumour refused to be quelled, spreading on social media like, well,
wildfire. Even when these stories are patiently debunked, they come back as
zombie myths that refuse to die.

Elon Musk was once lauded as a sort of green Tony Stark – the genius inventor
who leads a double life as superhero Iron Man – for single-handedly tackling
the climate crisis one Tesla at a time, helping to forge a clean energy future
and pushing for new taxes to drive down fossil fuel use.

But the climate credentials of the world’s richest person have become clouded
by his embrace of rightwing politicians, some of whom dismiss global heating,
as well as by his management of X, formerly known as Twitter, during which
many climate scientists have fled the platform amid a proliferation of
misinformation about the climate crisis.

They’re Ivy-League educated, brilliant academic minds and experienced in the
ways of markets, governments, data and statistics. Many have access to
information not readily available to the general public. They attend meetings,
forums and conferences with each other. They write books, review papers and
oversee research. They are our nation’s top economists. And they oftentimes
get it wrong. Very wrong.

Both the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and Fed chairman, Jerome Powell,
were wrong about inflation, having first called rising prices “transitory”
after Covid disrupted the entire world’s supply chain. Nobel winner Paul
Krugman publicly admitted his mistakes. They were not alone.

It has been an explosive weekend for Elon Musk. The American billionaire has
had to witness not only the public “rapid unscheduled disassembly” of another
of his rockets, but also watch while a group of well-known global companies,
including Apple, Disney and IBM, pulled advertising from X, his social media
platform.

The businesses, all of them household names, made the decision to stop
spending on the site, formerly known as Twitter, after the American
billionaire’s public support for an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Last
Wednesday, Musk replied to a conspiracy post which accused Jews of promoting

            <p>New UK foreign secretary’s promotion of China-backed development in Sri Lanka
has increased concern he could be a pawn for Xi Jinping

When Chinese president Xi Jinping cut the ribbon on Sri Lanka’s Port City
Colombo construction site in September 2014, it was promoted as a future major
hub in China’s global infrastructure project, the belt and road initiative.

With a financial centre, beach-front villas and an international yacht marina,
the city is aiming to be a rival to Dubai and Singapore. China has already

The 21 economies that make up the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum –

highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

If the US is “going to save the middle class” then Democrats and Republicans
must come together to back the newly resurgent labor movement, Bernie Sanders
told the Guardian this week ahead of a Senate hearing on the benefits of
unions.

Sanders is holding a Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
