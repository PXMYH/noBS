Lithium-ion batteries sparked four fires in just one day in New South Wales
this week, amid growing concern over the rise in battery-related blazes.

One man was taken to hospital and a 10-storey apartment block was evacuated
after an ebike battery exploded in Bankstown in Sydney’s south-west on
Thursday, while firefighters also responded to blazes set off by an electric
vehicle charging station in Berkeley, a garden hedger in Lake Macquarie, and a
loose battery in a garbage truck passing through Silverwater.

Labor groups and government officials are pushing to rein in rampant abuses of
workers in the fishing industry, where migrant laborers are frequently
subjected to slavery and violence from employers.

One out of every five fish is caught through illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing in conditions where abuses of workers are common,
according to a United Nations estimate. About 128,000 workers are thought to
be currently trapped in forced labor on remote fishing vessels around the
world, according to the International Labour Organization.

            <p>High prices, mega mergers and union busting are just water under the bridge
judging from the scramble for a new bag

What’s so special about Trader Joe’s new mini totes? Aesthetics-wise, nothing:
the canvas bag resembles LL Bean’s ubiquitous totes. The only difference is
that these come stamped with the name of a supermarket chain known for its
fancy cheeses, frozen dinners – and the fact that it’s currently one of the
corporations lobbying to declare the National Labor Relations Board
unconstitutional. Union drip, these are not.

Still, there are plenty of people who approach these bags with the same
enthusiasm that Trader Joe’s lawyers reportedly reserve for union busting.
Young women on TikTok have taken to decorating their mini Trader Joe’s totes
with embroidery, patches and paint. It all looks very summer camp. CNN
reported that the tote has reached a cult status not seen since … well, just a
few weeks ago, when pink Stanley tumblers took the world (or at least Target
shopping aisles) by storm.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
