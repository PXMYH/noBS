while Republicans praise Trump’s ‘art of the deal’ in action

US stocks fell again on Thursday after a historic rally following Donald

A Danish couple who fled their “forest resort” in Sweden for Guatemala and

criticism and claimed that their handling of the compost toilets was “very
normal”.

Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk, both chefs, abandoned their purportedly eco-
friendly retreat, Stedsans, in Halland, southern Sweden, last year. They owed
large sums to Swedish and Danish tax authorities. They have since set up a
business in Guatemala.

Breaking a record high for the third consecutive month, the average cost of a
dozen large eggs hit $6.23 in March – more than double the price just 12

Statistics on Thursday. This surpassed the previous record highs of $5.90 a
dozen in February, and $4.95 in January.

imports.

All imports are subject to 10% tariffs, with higher tariffs still in place for
certain industries like steel, aluminum and cars. As of Wednesday, the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite its links to oral cancer, people in Hainan have for centuries produced
and eaten betel nuts, which give a natural high. But sales are falling

Many cities across southern China are known for the art of relaxing. Chengdu
in Sichuan province is the tea house capital. Guangzhou is the birthplace of
dim sum, a time to share steamed dumplings and chew the fat with friends. And
in Haikou, the capital of Hainan province, people have been chewing the betel
nut for centuries.

You don’t have to walk far in Haikou to find a vendor. The small, hard, green
fruits are sold in little piles alongside fresh coconuts and bottled water at
pretty much any convenience store, for about five yuan (£0.52) a piece. Some
vendors, mostly women, sit by the side of the road to dish out betel nuts to
passing drivers on mopeds, nearly all of them men.

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
