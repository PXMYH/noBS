Children and teenagers are still at risk from online harm on Instagram despite

former senior engineer at Meta who testified against the company before US
Congress, New York University and Northeastern University academics, the UK’s
Molly Rose Foundation and other groups.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Under the known terms of the deal with China, TikTok would get a new board,
including Murdochs and Ellisons

Donald Trump revealed last week the US and China are close to inking a deal to

social network. The arrangement would gift Trump’s billionaire allies a degree
of control over US media that would be vast and unprecedented.

its security.

Europe’s richest man, the luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault, has said that
a wealth tax that could cost him more than €1bn (£817m) would be deadly for
France’s economy.

The French founder of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said in a statement to
the Sunday Times that calls for a 2% wealth tax on all assets “aims to destroy
the liberal economy, the only one that works for the good of all”.

In the heart of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, a property management firm has opened
a 19-bed co-living complex with rooms as small as 74 sq ft for rent. For
almost $1,900 a month, it is touting “authentic Brooklyn energy” on a block
“with real local charm”.

The firm, Cohabs, dubbed the site Crown 120. But for longtime residents, it
was the Kingston Lounge, a storied jazz club and bar. Its transformation
serves as a tangible reminder of cultural erasure and gentrification.

            <p>Fossil fuels made the nation prosperous but as reserves dwindle, do they drill
deeper, even as the Caribbean feels the heat of the climate crisis, or shift
to a greener economy?  

In 1930, Trinidad and Tobago produced more than 40% of the British empire’s
oil. By the 1970s, the newly independent republic was producing 278,000
barrels of crude oil a day. For a country of just 1 million people, after the
collapse of its sugar and cocoa industries, oil proved to be transformative.

Today, with a population of 1.5 million and oil production down to less than
54,000 barrels a day, Trinidad and Tobago is at a crossroads. The country’s
only petroleum refinery closed in 2018 due to mismanagement and declining
production by the state-owned Petrotrin company. A recent analysis noted that
the energy revenues plummeted 48.4% to $14.7bn (£10.9bn) in the last fiscal
year, while non-energy revenues grew by 26% to $32.7bn.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
