            <p>Carmarker rejects ruthless approach of former chief executive known for
pushing for bigger profits

Carlos Tavares is known as one of the most outspoken leaders in the car
industry. Among the executive class, the former Stellantis chief executive is
also considered to be one of the best drivers of its products on the track.

He used a similarly hard-driving style in the board room, constantly pushing
his managers and factories to deliver bigger profits. Yet after his enforced
departure from the global carmaker, it appears Tavares may have been better
off applying the brakes than charging ahead.

inspired nothing but ambivalence

23andMe is facing implosion. As the once-promising genetic testing company
flounders – losing 98% of its $6bn value, all its independent board members,
nearly half its staff – many of its 15 million customers are scrambling to
delete their DNA data from the company’s archives. I am one of them.

My reluctant path to 23andMe began in 2016, when I ordered a kit in the mail.
After letting the box sit on my desk for weeks, I finally spit in a tube and
sent it to the company for analysis. I am a technology journalist – I like to
think I am thoughtful about what data I share with corporations. When it comes
to genetic data, which unlike a password or credit card number cannot ever be

Christmas came early at the box office this year. Moana 2 brought in a tidal
wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with
$221m in ticket sales, according to studio estimates. That, combined with
Wicked and Gladiator II, made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas.

Expectations had been high for Disney’s Moana 2, but the film’s five-day
opening set a new record for Thanksgiving weekend. (The previous best was
$125m for Frozen 2 in its second week of release in 2019.) Moana 2 added
$165.3m internationally; with $386m worldwide, it’s the second-best global
launch of the year.

A former Harrods director has claimed he was handed envelopes of cash by

senior management and cover up alleged incidents of sexual abuse.

Jon Brilliant, who worked in Fayed’s private office for 18 months, claimed his
former boss would sack those he could not control. Managers were let go or
quit so often that a national newspaper began to publish a regular count,
which reached 48 in 2005, he said.

Elon Musk, named by Donald Trump to co-lead a commission aimed at reducing the
size of the federal government, is poised to undermine funding for rural
broadband services to benefit his satellite internet services company,
Starlink.

Musk has long been a critic of the Biden administration’s Broadband Equity,
Access, and Deployment (Bead) Program, which provides $42.45bn through the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill to expand high-speed internet access in rural
communities. Starlink, the satellite internet services subsidiary of SpaceX,
has largely been shut out of this funding after government agencies deemed it
too slow to qualify.

Miles, a 37-year-old NHS doctor from London, has been trying to persuade
friends to buy cryptocurrencies for years. In recent weeks, the “Trump pump”
to crypto prices has left them envious. “They have watched in frustration as
my gamble paid off,” he says.

Miles’s crypto portfolio is now worth £2.3m, despite having cashed out about
£600,000 earlier this year to buy a house. **** “It’s set me up for life,”
says Miles, who invested £4,000 in bitcoin in 2012. “My pot fluctuates by
hundreds of thousands each day, but I’ve been through years of volatile
periods.”

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
