  * Business live – latest updates

Apple, Google’s parent company and Meta are being investigated by the EU for
potential breaches of the bloc’s new laws designed to police anti-competitive
behaviour by big technology companies.

The trio face significant fines if they are found guilty of breaching the

Sam Bankman-Fried, once the CEO of FTX and a billionaire wunderkind of the
cryptocurrency world, will be sentenced to prison time on Thursday in New York
City.

Should the judge in his case impose the harshest penalty allowed, the 32-year-
old would face more than 100 years and die an incarcerated man, a possibility
his lawyer has called “grotesque.”

Splitting the bill with Venmo, paying with your Starbucks app, tap-and-go with
your phones – how we pay for things has changed forever. But while our options
have changed, and are still changing, some small business owners seem
determined to either keep us counting bills or jump feet first into their idea
of the future.

Case in point from my home town: the owner of the restaurant in South
Philadelphia who “doesn’t accept credit cards” and instead forces their
customers to use an ATM machine which – conveniently – charges a $4.50 fee to

            <p>The criminal trial over the $11bn sale of Autonomy to HP saw prosecutors
calling him ‘Dr Lynch’ – and defense using ‘Mike’

At the height of his career, Mike Lynch – once the UK’s leading tech

Silicon Valley giant in an $11bn (£8.6bn) deal. Last Monday, more than a dozen
years later, that deal became the centrepiece of a trial in San Francisco.

Lynch has been charged with 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and
conspiracy by the US authorities, who claim that Hewlett-Packard’s troubled
acquisition of Lynch’s Autonomy was built on lies. If convicted, he faces up
to 25 years in jail. He has pleaded not guilty.

flight.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
