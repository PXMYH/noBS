bring an end to the war with Russia. Nuveen’s Laura Cooper thinks the Fed will
need to see more upside inflation surprises before they get more cautious. Amy
Wu Silverman of RBC sees more hedging in the market and thinks it’s wrong to
treat the dates for Trump’s announced tariffs as hard in the calendar, as

            <p>Bruce and Nancy Steele had a business that produced honey for the past 30
years before the Eaton fire destroyed it

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the
California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert:
watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner,
was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Britain used to solicit money that the US would not touch – but with oligarchs
and fraudsters on the rise, it must now uphold the law

Five decades ago, the United States was in turmoil. A long and unpopular war
was ending in defeat; inflation was high; and American politicians were
accused of high-handed and illegal behaviour.

If all this sounds remarkably similar to the last few years, that’s because it
is. But the mid-1970s was different in one crucial respect: how the US
responded to it, and particularly how it responded to corruption. Major
corporations had been giving bribes to win contracts in South Korea, Italy and
Saudi Arabia; US politicians were appalled – and they acted to uphold values
other than money.

Oliver Bullough is the author of Butler to the World: How Britain Became the
Servant of Tycoons, Tax Dodgers, Kleptocrats and Criminals, and Moneyland: Why
Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It Back

New Jersey, her excitement did not last long. Two days later, when lenders
requested bank details for their loan, she discovered their savings account
was empty. Her credit card was maxed out, too.

It was a Wednesday in November 2023. Earlier that day D’Alessandro’s husband
had said he needed to get something from his mother’s house. Preparing dinner
for their two young sons, she texted him to ask when he was coming home.

            <p>Super Bowl appearance continues the retailer’s vibe shift from slightly boring
staples into a raved-about brand

Almost a week on from the Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar’s half-time performance
is still being talked about. In particular, the pair of boot-cut jeans worn by
the American rapper as he commanded the stage. But while those came from the
luxury fashion brand Celine and cost £830, the scores of backup dancers
surrounding him wore a high street label – to be precise, £19.90 oversized
T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo.

It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily
grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For
a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless
casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift. It now infiltrates the wardrobes of
everyone from gen Z youngsters who love its cargo joggers and cult crossbody
bag, to their grandparents who rave about its Heattech thermals and affordable
cashmere jumpers.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
