Millions of Americans are more likely to be ripped off by scammers and thieves
as a result of a bid by the Trump administration to defang the top US consumer
watchdog, former officials have warned.

  * Tesla sales almost halve in Europe over Musk’s ties to Trump

When Mike Schwede first sat in a Tesla Roadster 15 years ago, he felt like it

US consumer confidence plummeted in February, the biggest monthly decline in
nearly four years, a business research group said on Tuesday, with inflation
seemingly stuck and a trade war under Donald Trump seen by a growing number of
Americans as inevitable.

The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index sank this

            <p>Democrats in Nevada push bill that would provide further relief for tipped
workers who can be paid as little as $2.13

Donald Trump began the second term of his presidency last month with a victory
lap at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, a key swing state he flipped in 2024, by
reaffirming his campaign promise to pass a proposal to abolish taxes on tips.

Nearly 6 million workers around the US rely on tips for most of their income.
Under federal law, tipped workers can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour, a
minimum that has not changed since 1991. Only seven states, Alaska,
California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, have banned the
sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.

Chinese fishing fleets are allegedly using North Korean forced labour, a
potential breach of international sanctions, with workers allegedly kept at
sea for up to a decade, according to a new report by the UK-based
Environmental Justice Foundation.

The EJF report, published on Monday, has identified at least 12 Chinese deep-

Trump ally digs in and threatens job losses

The US government’s human resources office has walked back an ultimatum issued
by Elon Musk that would have forced its workers to resign if they did not
submit a bullet-point list of their recent accomplishments, in one of the
first signs of internal pushback to the Tesla billionaire’s campaign to
downsize the federal workforce.

The demand, made in an email sent to millions of government employees over the
weekend and quickly sued over by a coalition of labor and advocacy groups,
represented the latest salvo by the “department of government efficiency”
(Doge), the Trump-sanctioned cost-cutting initiative Musk chairs.

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the
California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert:
watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner,
was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures
included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a
threadbare T-shirt from Occidental College, the school where Bruce and Nancy
first met – and where he would go on to work for more than 35 years.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
