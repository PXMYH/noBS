Kazakhstan’s national airline has announced plans to float on the London stock

Long before trumpeting the need to pair profit with progressive philosophies
became a cornerstone of corporate America, Maria Burns Oritz believed in
building the type of businesses that will do well and do good. Even before its

Games was a side hustle focused on developing software and gaming platforms

AnnMaria Waddell (Burns Ortiz’s sister is wrestler, Olympian and video game

            <p>A joint investigation by Floodlight and Capital B shows millions of dollars
flowed from utilities to Black leaders and their groups since at least 2009

Former Florida state representative Joe Gibbons sat in the library of the
Faith Community church in Greensboro, North Carolina, trying to convince its
pastor to quit promoting rooftop solar.

With a lobbyist’s charms Gibbons told the Rev Nelson Johnson that rooftop
solar, which allows customers to generate their own renewable electricity, was
bad for people of color. Gibbons argued that it created an imbalance in which
those without solar panels end up subsidizing those who have them, Johnson
recalled in an interview with Floodlight.

Klan in 1979, had trouble believing him.

            <p>As prized shoals of flying fish move away from Barbados and closer to Tobago,
decades-old tensions between the islands are growing over fisheries,
sustainability and territorial waters

Andel Daniel has been fishing in Trinidad and Tobago’s territorial waters for
more than 30 years. During that time, he has seen a significant drop in the
number of flying fish within his patch of the Caribbean Sea.

Cleaning his catch on the quayside of Buccoo after an early morning fishing
trip, he blames the shortage on fishing boats from Barbados and Venezuela
moving into Tobago’s waters.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by

racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many

retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility
