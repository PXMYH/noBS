response, X has said it plans to attract smaller and medium-sized businesses
to prop up its income.

definitely underplayed for a long time,” a statement given by the company to

The German government is struggling to find a way out of a billion euro budget
crisis that risks stifling its vision for environmental and industrial
transformation and plunging the country into years of economic stagnation.

More immediately, the consequences of a ruling by the country’s highest court

            <p>Experts advise the city’s first AAPI female bookstore owner on a plan to
reopen Yu &amp; Me Books in its original location in Chinatown

For Lucy Yu, who runs what’s believed to be New York City’s first Asian
American woman-owned bookstore, losing her brick-and-mortar business was akin
to losing a child. But since 4 July of this year, when a blaze engulfed the
Chinatown building that housed Yu &amp; Me Books, the 29-year-old has had little
time to process her grief.

Within hours of the blaze, she shifted into rebuild mode: right after
firefighters brought the fire under control, Yu and a friend ran into the
store and hauled inventory into plastic bags and tarps. They salvaged a couple
thousand books from the wreckage, just under half of the collection. The
effort left Yu coughing and short of breath for the next two weeks.

            <p>Employees paid tribute to Mai Ubeid, who was killed in Gaza, and denounced
Project Nimbus, which provides services to Israel’s military

In the shadow of Google’s sprawling New York City campus, former and current
Google and Amazon workers gathered on Tuesday evening to pay tribute to Mai
Ubeid, a young woman and software engineer who was killed in an Israeli
airstrike in Gaza along with her whole family. The workers also took the
opportunity to castigate their employers for contracts with the Israeli
military.

Ubeid had graduated from a Google-funded coding bootcamp, Gaza Sky Geeks, and
later interned at a firm that was part of the Google for Startups accelerator
program in 2020. Those who knew her have described her in written tributes and
in interviews with the Guardian as a strong and determined visionary. She had
muscular dystrophy and, as such, used a wheelchair to get around. Ubeid
dreamed of one day developing a platform for people with disabilities to
network and connect, according to Kathrine Tinggaard Nicolaisen, a former
communications manager at Gaza Sky Geeks based in the West Bank who knew and
had met Ubeid.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
