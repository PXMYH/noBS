            <p>Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are increasingly obsessed with artificial
intelligence and its promise of a turbocharged economy, but are not ready to
make a big call that the revolution is under way. The Fed is under pressure to
consider the effects of AI on the economy, with some analysts seeing signs of
increased productivity, while others are concerned about above-target
inflation and weak job markets. The impact of AI on the economy is still
unclear, with some economists thinking it may be an early sign of a
productivity boom, while others warn of potential job losses and social
problems due to white-collar displacement. Bloomberg&#39;s Enda Curran joined
Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on &#39;Bloomberg Businessweek Daily&#39; to break it
down. (Source: Bloomberg)

New revelations about the tense relationship between Fox News and Donald Trump
in the fall of 2020 have emerged in a trove of thousands of court documents
released on Sunday as part of a massive defamation lawsuit filed against the
network by voting technology company Smartmatic.

One exchange showed that Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox News
parent company Fox Corp, told star anchor Sean Hannity in a 1 October 2020
text chain that Trump could not appear on Fox again if he attacked the
network.

US senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal have asked the heads of the

(SEC) to investigate revenue from ads on Facebook and Instagram that promote
scams and banned goods.

“The FTC and SEC should immediately open investigations and, if the reporting
is accurate, pursue vigorous enforcement action where appropriate” to force
Meta to disgorge profits, pay penalties and agree to cease running such
advertisements, Hawley and Blumenthal wrote in a letter to the federal
agencies.

Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution
offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant,
ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most
Admired Companies by the magazine, describes its financial advisers as “expert
listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after
goal”.

It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes
it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that
could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file
into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month
internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in
beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent
graduates themselves.

If you feel like the price of Thanksgiving this year is more expensive to
gobble up, you’re not alone. Amid widening concerns about the rising cost of
living, polls show consumers are increasingly worried about inflation.

Economists say the picture for holiday food prices this year is more mixed –
prices are volatile and depend largely on how families shop around for their

            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million

than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Critics are concerned that Daniel Suhr, the head of a conservative legal
group, may be pulling the strings behind many of the Trump FCC’s moves

networks at a time when they face both financial and political
vulnerabilities.

Suhr has had a key ally in Brendan Carr, who was hand-picked by Donald Trump
to serve as the chair of the powerful Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the release of the closely watched
consumer price index (CPI) for October, citing the government shutdown – the
longest in history, before it ended earlier this month – and stating it could
not “retroactively collect” the data required for the report.

            <p>Beijing reimposes 2023 ban, citing Japan PM’s comment that military would
respond to Chinese attack on island

China has suspended imports of Japanese seafood again, as the fallout over the
Japanese prime minister’s comments about Taiwan continues to escalate in one
of worst bilateral disputes in years.

The ban was first reported on Wednesday by the Japanese outlets Kyodo News and

            <p>This story of emancipated young women escaping draconian social strictures
brims with enthusiasm and features a cameo from Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Based on a true story, Bill Guttentag’s rousing drama attests to the
resilience of women who dare to dream despite draconian social strictures. The
film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and
businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who
assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The
young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same
zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women
are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their
quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public
scorn from conservatives.

Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which
splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-
enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.)
A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around
the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces
are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than
competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they
offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.

The former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is making a claim of “conspiracy”
against the government of Jersey after the crown dependency launched a
criminal investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering in
connection with the original source of the oligarch’s wealth.

The latest move threatens to throw open parts of a secretive legal battle on
the Channel island about the tycoon’s rise to become one of the world’s
richest people, which emerged in September after a Switzerland federal
criminal court ordered the release of a cache of Swiss banking records
requested by the Jersey attorney general.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
