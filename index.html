Earlier this month the Trump administration moved forward with eliminating a
loophole that allowed businesses to avoid tariffs if making purchases under
$800. Some experts say that the “de minimis” exemption will hit “many, many”
small businesses hard.

“The de minimis suspension ending is yet another change that has forced every
American small business owner to become an accidental trade policy expert
overnight,” Jacob Bennett, CEO and co-founder of small business banking
platform Crux Analytics, told Forbes. “There’s this whiplash effect that many,
many small business owners are now feeling which is leading to growing
uncertainty and concern about how they’re going to continue running their
business.”

It’s been a year since Brian Niccol took the top job at Starbucks and promised
change after years of bitter fighting with the company’s burgeoning union.

“I deeply respect the right of partners to choose, through a fair and
democratic process, to be represented by a union,” Niccol wrote in a letter to
the union last September. “If our partners choose to be represented, I am
committed to making sure we engage constructively and in good faith with the
union and the partners it represents.”

            <p>Issue creates clear dividing line between left and right, as populists target
voters with vow to scrap levy

It is the issue that has set the Norwegian general election alight: whether to
keep, cut or abolish the national wealth tax. As the country prepares to go to
the polls on Monday, Norway is in the grip of a ferocious national argument
that is likely to rumble on whichever party wins.

In an economy less then a seventh the size of Britain’s, the _formuesskatt_
raises about 32bn kroner (£2.4bn). Multiply that by the difference in GDP, and
the same rules applied in the UK could raise more than £17bn – serious money
in tax terms. Defenders say the wealth tax has another benefit. They see it as
the cornerstone of a progressive tax system that has helped to create one of
Europe’s most equal societies.

McEntarfer, hours after July’s statistics were released last month.

As you board the plane, the flight attendant welcomes you on board. They point

demonstration, and preparing the plane for takeoff. And there’s a good chance
they have done it all for free.

But a tentative deal between Air Canada and thousands of flight attendants has
sparked hope more airlines will end a little-known reality for many North
American cabin crews – and pay flight attendants when planes are not moving.

  * Business live – latest updates

Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to overturn a lower court decision
that most of his sweeping trade tariffs were illegal.

The US president filed a petition late on Wednesday to ask for a review of
last week’s federal appeals court ruling in Washington DC, which centred on
his “liberation day” border taxes introduced on 2 April that imposed levies of
between 10% and 50% on most US imports and sent shock waves through global
trade and markets.

            <p>Judge said tech giant had monopoly but let it keep Chrome and Android; critics
cried foul while Wall Street cheered

A judge ruled on Tuesday that Google would not be forced to sell its Chrome
browser or the Android operating system, saving the tech giant from the most
severe penalties sought by the US government. The same judge had ruled in
favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and
maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.

Groups critical of Google’s dominance in the internet search and online
advertising industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity
to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the
crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by
contrast, are thrilled. Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have
risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
