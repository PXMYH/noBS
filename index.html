            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Facebook and Instagram parent’s deal follows other big tech companies signing
agreements with power companies

Meta on Tuesday said it had struck an agreement to keep one nuclear reactor of
a US utility company in Illinois operating for 20 years.

Meta’s deal with Constellation Energy is the social networking company’s first
with a nuclear power plant. Other large tech companies are looking to secure
electricity as US power demand rises significantly in part due to the needs of
artificial intelligence and datacenters. Google has reached agreements to
supply its datacenters with nuclear power via a half-dozen small reactors
built by a California utility company. Microsoft’s similar contract will
restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of the most serious
nuclear accident and radiation leak in US history.

            <p>Is artificial intelligence coming for everyone’s jobs? Not if this lot have
anything to do with it

The novelist Ewan Morrison was alarmed, though amused, to discover he had
written a book called Nine Inches Pleases a Lady. Intrigued by the limits of
generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had asked ChatGPT to give him the
names of the 12 novels he had written. “I’ve only written nine,” he says.
“Always eager to please, it decided to invent three.” The “nine inches” from
the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthy Robert Burns poem. “I
just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,” says Morrison. He is yet
to write Nine Inches – “or its sequel, Eighteen Inches”, he laughs. His actual
latest book, For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human
costs of technology.

Morrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and their
capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one
of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are
terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don’t
want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it’s a bit rubbish,
and more trouble than it’s worth; and those who simply prefer humans to
robots.

            <p>Morocco’s commercial centre has brought investment to the continent – but
critics say it masks domestic inequality

For centuries, Casablanca was a significant trading hub for merchants from
across the breadth of the Atlantic coast, given its geographical position
between Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

These days, Morocco’s economic capital is merging those historical roots with
a strong modern commercial identity. One such manifestation is the Casablanca
Finance City (CFC) district, whose high-rise buildings stand as a symbol of
the city’s dream of being a main gateway for international investment into
Africa.

  * Business live – latest updates

China has accused the US of “seriously violating” the fragile US-China detente
that has been in place for less than a month since the two countries agreed to
pause the trade war that risked upending the global economy.

China and the US agreed on 12 May to pause for 90 days the skyrocketing
“reciprocal” tariffs that both countries had placed on the others goods in a
frenzied trade war that started a few weeks earlier. Tariffs had reached 125%
on each side, which officials feared amounted to virtual embargo on trade
between the world’s two biggest economies.

Union Confederation, the largest trade union federation in the world.

The index noted workers’ rights and democracy around the world are often under

Whether it’s Donald Trump and Elon Musk in the US or Javier Milei and Eduardo
Eurnekian in Argentina, we see the same playbook of unfairness and

Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the age of 94 from Berkshire
Hathaway. Donald Trump’s behavior, at the age of 78, continues to raise

agenda, and fuelled the rising interest in nuclear power.

Europe’s largest power blackout in decades, still largely unexplained, has
raised questions about whether renewable energy can be relied on to provide a
stable source of clean energy. It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the
global nuclear power renaissance already under way.

Hospitality venues in France such as hotels, restaurants and campsites that do
not admit children could face prosecution under proposals for a crackdown that
emerged this week.

Laurence Rossignol, a socialist senator, plans to introduce a private member’s
bill to make it illegal to ban children from such establishments, the Times
reported, while the French high commissioner for childhood, Sarah El Haïry,
said government lawyers were looking into whether it would be possible to take
legal action against places that exclude families.

As the first Pride month under Donald Trump’s second presidency approaches,
LGBTQ+ businesses are stepping up, evolving quickly to meet the community’s
growing concerns.

Since day one, Trump has signed executive orders targeting the LGBTQ+
community, particularly the trans and gender non-conforming population. He
aims to eradicate “gender ideology” by enforcing a two-sex binary determined
at conception, reinstating and expanding the military ban on transgender
service members, and directing agencies to prevent gender-affirming care for
youth.

If you want a bellwether to measure the broad impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs
on the economy, look south, to Georgia. The political swing state has a $900bn
economy – somewhere between the GDPs of Taiwan and Switzerland.

The hospitality industry is facing an existential crisis. Wine merchants
wonder aloud if they will survive the year. But others, like those in
industrial manufacturing, will carefully argue that well-positioned businesses
will profit. Some say they’re insulated from international competition by the
nature of their industry. Others, like the movie industry, are simply confused
by the proposals that have been raised, and are looking for entirely different
answers. So far, it’s a mixed bag.

            <p>Time and time again over the past four months, reality has failed to match

“Tariffs are easy,” Donald Trump claimed in March. For his administration, and
the world, they have proven anything but. Now an obscure New York court has
blocked his signature trade policy, setting up a battle that looks sure to end
up in the supreme court.

The plan was simple. For decades, Trump has made the case for tariffs. Now, in
his second term, he would dramatically hike them on the world; raise trillions
of dollars for the federal government; cut taxes for Americans; and lure
manufacturers to the country’s industrial heartlands, creating millions of
jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
