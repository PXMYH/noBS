The genetic testing company 23andMe has said that nearly 7 million people have
been affected by a security breach that put DNA ancestry information into the
hands of hackers who broke into the site in early October.

On Friday, the California-based company said in a regulatory filing that the
personal data of 0.1% of customers – or about 14,000 individuals – had been
accessed by “threat actors”. But the filing warned that hackers were also able
to access “a significant number of files containing profile information about
other users’ ancestry”.

China’s ability to repay its government borrowing has been downgraded by the

the property sector would undermine efforts to revive its flagging economy.

Moody’s warned that Beijing would need to bail out local and regional

debts, hampering efforts to boost investment and growth.

It’s lunchtime on a rainy Saturday at Westfield Garden State Plaza, New

packed, with families in booths, clusters of teens at high-tops, and a long
line at Chick-fil-A where Gael, Odell and Katie, teenagers from over the
border in New York state, have just bought their food.

Their local mall hosts mostly small businesses, so when Katie had an eye
appointment nearby the rest were happy to tag along and check out all the
Garden state has to offer. “Aritzia, Pink, I really like the Body Shop,” Katie
says; Gael and Odell are in search of Funko-Pops, big-headed collectible
figurines, from a favorite anime, Jujutsu Kaisen.

  * See all our Cop 28 coverage

At least 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists have been granted access to the Cop28
climate negotiations, according to an analysis.

The figure calculated by the Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition is a
record number that raises further questions about the fossil fuel industry’s
influence over this year’s UN summit, which is being run by the president of
the United Arab Emirates’ national oil company.

Fossil fuel lobbyists received more passes than the combined total of
delegates (1,609) from the 10 most climate vulnerable countries combined,
including Somalia, Chad, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Sudan.

Many fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access as part of a trade association,
of which nine of the 10 largest came from the global north. This included the
Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association, which brought 116
people including representatives from Shell, TotalEnergies and Norway’s
Equinor.

California regulators are alleging a San Francisco robotaxi service owned by

driverless cars, raising the specter they may add a fine to the recent
suspension of its California license.

The potential penalty facing GM’s Cruise service could be around $1.5m, based
on documents filed late last week by the California public utilities
commission.

            <p>High-income Americans also almost as likely to defer healthcare over cost as
people with low or average incomes in other countries

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
