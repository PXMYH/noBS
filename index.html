            <p>Small California producers say Trump’s EU levies are driving up costs and
threatening family businesses

Kory Burke, a small producer of high-quality wines in central California,
never believed that tariffs on imports from France or Italy could help boost
his business. But he knew for sure they would be a big hindrance as soon as
Donald Trump announced late last month that he was slapping a 15% levy on all

said he’d take on 2% of the additional cost of importing corks from Europe,
but I would have to absorb the other 13%. Then my barrel supplier got in

she grew up with in India.

A former line cook who was doing marketing for a Bay Area grocer, Javeri Kadri

            <p>UMG have called for Drake’s motion to include Grainge’s communications on the
matter to be denied, calling it ‘so strained’ as to ‘defy credulity’

Universal Music Group has denied new allegations made by Drake’s lawyers that
its British chair and chief executive Lucian Grainge had a “role in and
knowledge of the scheme to defame and harass” the Canadian rapper by peer
Kendrick Lamar, and that as such the label should “collect, review and
produce” communications by Grainge.

Drake is suing UMG – his label Republic’s parent company – over its release of
Lamar’s 2024 diss track Not Like Us, which contains the line: “Say, Drake, I
hear you like ’em young … Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles.” The

with icons used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders.

Shares in Intel have jumped 7.4% after it was reported that the Trump

  * Business live – latest updates

A swarm of jellyfish has forced the shutdown of one of the largest nuclear
power plants in France after entering the water intake systems used to cool
the coastal reactors.

Three reactors at the Gravelines nuclear power plant in northern France shut
down automatically late on Sunday, according to the French nuclear company
EDF, after the filter drums of the pumping stations became packed with a
“massive and unpredictable” swarm of the marine creatures.

            <p>The controversial $8bn deal was finalized this week and while details are
scarce, the future is set to look very different for one of the biggest
Hollywood studios

The merger between Paramount and Skydance has finally been completed, with
various roadblocks (including Stephen Colbert, apparently, as well as the
related 60 Minutes settlement/bribery) cleared from the path of a new entity
called Paramount, A Skydance Corporation.

It’s an appropriately franchise-y moniker for a merger between a major
Hollywood studio and a company that made its bones as a constant financer of
some of its biggest movie series. This ends (for now) years of speculation
over what might be done with Paramount, a global conglomerate that was
nonetheless considered on less sure footing than its fellow remaining big five
studios, Disney, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. (Well, maybe not the
recently embattled Warner Bros, though they seem to have gotten a major
reprieve with their killer 2025 slate) Skydance honcho David Ellison is the
new Paramount CEO. The new co-chairs of Paramount Pictures will be Skydance
executive Dana Goldberg and former Sony executive Josh Greenstein.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
