            <p>Gold at all-time high, and bitcoin at 18-month peak, as traders bet on US
interest rate cuts early next year, while 1,600 jobs are being lost as Spotify
cuts costs

  *  **British workers missing out on £10,700 a year as living standards fall**

 **In London, the stock market has opened lower, failing to follow gold’s
lead.**

The FTSE 100 index down 39 points or 0.5% at 7490 points, having ended at a
six-week high on Friday.

The M&amp;A speculation has skyrocketed shares in William Hill’s parent company
today which is trading up by around 13%. 888 currently has a market cap or
around £355 million, sharpy below the reported offer price from Playtech.

Shares in 888 have had a tough time this year, shedding over 20% year-on-year
even after today’s surge and 50% in the past five years, highlighting the
potential for an opportunistic takeover. Playtech is not the only party
reported to be interested - in November, the Financial Times reported that US
betting group DraftKings was also eyeing up a bid for 888 over the summer.

Gold has hit new record dollar levels – reflecting not just current
uncertainty, but also the de-dollarisation narrative and it’s attractions as
an inflation and market hedge, and long-term value.

Let’s get the “desirability” and emotional aspects out the way. I am told a
significant influence on the price of gold is the weather – a good monsoon in
India means farmers buy more bangles for their daughters’ weddings from the
gold souks. It is beautiful. It is lustrous. It is unblemished. It is Gold.
_Always believe in…_ _Gold!_ There will always be demand for gold for personal
adornment – which is pretty much irrelevant when it comes to its proposition
as an investment asset.

As an investment in its own right gold performs well; over the last 50 years
Gold prices have risen over 3000%, compared to a 3500% gain in the S&amp;P 500.
However, in periods of financial instability gold outperforms stocks – notably
over the past 20-years even though the prices of financial assets were
artificially juiced by the effects of zero interest rates! In terms of risk,
companies come and go, but Gold is forever. If the world remains unstable –
and no reason to think it won’t – then gold should be front and centre on your
radar – no matter how archaic you consider it.

Major advertisers like Disney, IBM and Apple are still withholding ad dollars

two days after he launched an expletive-laden tirade to describe his feelings
about the pull back. Marketing agencies are pulling back from it as well. In
response, X has said it plans to attract smaller and medium-sized businesses
to prop up its income.

“Small and medium businesses are a very significant engine that we have
definitely underplayed for a long time,” a statement given by the company to

transformation and plunging the country into years of economic stagnation.

More immediately, the consequences of a ruling by the country’s highest court
– which stunned economists and policy-makers by deeming that the government’s

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
