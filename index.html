            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>US job growth was robust in April and the unemployment rate held steady
despite deep uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which
economists expect will dent hiring plans over the coming months. Nonfarm
payrolls increased 177,000 last month after the prior two months’ advances
were revised lower, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data out Friday.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%. The report suggests the labor
market continues to cool gradually, a sign that businesses facing heightened
uncertainty around tariffs and turmoil in financial markets didn’t
significantly alter their hiring plans. Most economists think the brunt of the
impact from levies will be seen in coming months. Claudia Sahm, Chief
Economist at New Century Advisors, reacts to the latest nonfarm payrolls data
and explains how the US may be able to avoid a recession. Dr. Sahm speaks with
Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio. (Source: Bloomberg)

The EU’s strategy to secure its own supply of microchips is “deeply
disconnected from reality”, a damning report by the official European court of
auditors (ECA) has found.

The ECA reported that the bloc was “very unlikely” to meet its 2030 target of
supplying 20% of the world’s microchips at a time when global demand for
semiconductors is booming to meet the growing needs of defence, green tech and
artificial intelligence.

            <p>In Kansas, Panasonic and two community colleges scaled up training fast. But
jobs in the EV industry could be affected by Trump’s war on clean energy

In a Kansas City classroom, 20 students were learning how basic circuit boards
work. They fiddled with knobs, switches, levers and wires; if they got the
connections right, tiny light bulbs glowed.

The students, recruited for the opportunity by Panasonic, were participants in
an eight-week apprenticeship course that involved classes at the community
college and on-the-job training. When they’re done, they will be among the
first workers at the company’s new electric vehicle battery factory in nearby
De Soto, Kansas. The $4bn manufacturing plant – touted as the largest EV
battery factory in the world – is expected to open in early summer and
eventually employ roughly 4,000 people. Panasonic also paid for the students’
tuition, as well as the instructor’s salary.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
