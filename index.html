Oil prices have risen sharply after Iran rejected calls to end support for
attacks by Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea and sent a warship to the
key trading route.

In the first trading session of the new year, Brent crude rose $1.73, or more
than 2%, to $78.77 a barrel on Tuesday, while US West Texas Intermediate crude
was at $73.36 a barrel, up $1.71, or 2.4%.

            <p>Brazilian-born Nemuel DePaula wants his Lenita flower truck business to
blossom in its brick-and-mortar location

Nemuel DePaula has never been afraid of big pivots. The Brazil native
immigrated to Boston at age 10, started his own graphic design business,
Grita, while still in high school, and moved himself and the business across
the country to Los Angeles in 2013. Four years later, DePaula took a gamble
again with Lenita, the part-time mobile flower shop he launched and named
after his mother.

DePaula, 35, has been captivated by flowers since childhood. “The first thing
I ever stole was a rose,” he said with a laugh as he recalled the perfect
bloom he snipped from his neighbor’s garden and slipped to his mom as a small
child. Over the years, his aesthetic sensibilities evolved from purloined
roses to less conventional species. His latest love is the “graffiti
anthurium”, a tropical flower with a natural paint-splattered effect that
resembles a bloodied orchid – but in a cool way.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Momentum seemed to be with US lawmakers as they planned to stop 150m Americans
from using TikTok. What happened?

Banning TikTok in the US seemed almost inevitable at the start of 2023. The
previous year saw a trickle of legislative actions against the short-form
video app, after dozens of individual states barred TikTok from government
devices in late 2022 over security concerns. At the top of the new year, the
US House followed suit, and four universities blocked TikTok from campus wifi.

The movement to prohibit TikTok grew into a flash flood by spring. CEO Shou Zi
Chew was called before Congress for brutal questioning in March. By April –
with support from the White House (and Joe Biden’s predecessor) – it seemed a
federal ban of the app was not just possible, but imminent.

            <p>Strikes by autoworkers, actors and writers brought wins in 2023, but analysts
worry labor laws could undo progress

Labor experts see more wins ahead in 2024 for US unions after a year of
attention-grabbing strikes and surging public support but worry gains may be
stymied by the US’s “broken” labor laws.

Strikes by autoworkers, writers, actors and nurses and a threatened strike by
UPS workers all led to significant wins in 2023. “The big challenge for labor
in 2024 will be to take that momentum and turn it into new organizing and
getting first contracts where workers have organized,” said Ken Jacobs, the
co-director of the UC Berkeley Labor Center. “That’s going to be a real
challenge because labor law in the US is broken.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Stung by 2008’s oil price spike, Uruguay now produces up to 98% of its
electricity from renewables. Can other countries follow suit?

It was the 2000s, and fossil fuel prices were rising worldwide. After a period
of volatility in the 1980s, the crude oil price per barrel had reached one of
its lowest points – $20 – at the end of 2001 but then, over the course of six
years, it tripled before a new oil shock saw prices surpass those of the
1970s, reaching a record $145 a barrel on 3 July 2008.

Uruguay imports its oil, so it had a problem. Demand for energy in the country
had grown by 8.4% the previous year and household energy bills were increasing
at a similar rate. The 3.4 million-strong population was becoming restless.
Lacking alternatives, President Tabaré Vázquez was forced to buy energy from
neighbouring states at higher prices, even though Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay had a mutual aid agreement in case of emergency conditions.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
