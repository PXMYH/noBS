the president threatens punitive import tariffs on US allies and enemies
alike.

Canada is the “most European of the non-European countries”, Mark Carney said
during his first overseas trip as prime minister to France and the UK, where
he is seeking stronger alliances to deal with Donald Trump’s attacks on his
country’s sovereignty and economy.

Without mentioning the US president by name, Carney and the French president,
Emmanuel Macron, made a joint appearance in Paris to show a united stance
against what they said were economic and geopolitical crises – a reference to
Trump’s trade war and “America first” diplomacy that has left longtime allies
scrambling.

China’s government has announced ambitious plans to “vigorously boost

attempt to increase consumer confidence and lift its struggling economy.

The plans, announced by the ruling Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) central

            <p>Women’s goods are taxed at a higher rate than men’s, an invisible bias that is
estimated to cost women $2.5bn a year

Many shoppers know about the so-called pink tax – a needless markup on
products marketed to women, even if those products are essentially the same,
just cheaper, when sold to men. Personal care items such as razors, deodorants
and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink
tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.

Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at
the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized
sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.

This has been a long time coming for Brough Brothers, which opened its first

The UK economy contracted by 0.1% in January, dealing a blow to Rachel Reeves
before the spring statement later this month.

In a surprise to City economists, who had expected 0.1% growth in January, the
Office for National Statistics data showed the services sector failed to
offset a decline in the industrial sector and maintain growth from the
previous month.

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol

husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
