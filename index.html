Settlement talks have collapsed between Facebook’s parent company, Meta, and
Kenyan content moderators over a lawsuit alleging unfair dismissal, a tech
rights group working with the plaintiffs has said.

The 184 moderators sued Meta and two subcontractors earlier this year after
they allegedly lost their jobs with one of the subcontractors, Sama, for
organising a union. They say they were then blacklisted from applying for the
same roles at a second firm, Majorel, after Facebook changed contractors.

China has arrested the former head of one of the country’s largest commercial

year anti-corruption drive targeting the financial sector.

China’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which is
investigating corruption within the ruling Communist party, said on Monday
that Liu Liange had been arrested, after announcing the start of the
investigation in March.

The rugged and beautiful Thacker Pass in the desert mountains of northern

It has witnessed bloody and terrible history. On 12 September 1865, US federal
soldiers in the 1st Nevada cavalry committed a massacre of Native Americans,
the Numu, across Thacker Pass, named Peehee Mu’huh – Rotten Moon, in the Numu
language. Thirty to 50 Native Americans are believed to have been killed,
including women and children.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
