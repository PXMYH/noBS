“What if I told you one of the strongest choices you could make was the choice
to ask for help?” says a young, twentysomething woman in a red sweater, before
recommending that viewers seek out counselling. This advert, promoted on
Instagram and other social media platforms, is just one of many campaigns
created by the California-based company BetterHelp, which offers to connect
users with online therapists.

The need for sophisticated digital alternatives to conventional face-to-face
therapy has been well established in recent years. If we go by the latest data

Do you hate self-checkout kiosks? Do you find them to be difficult, time-
consuming and frustrating? Well, you’re wrong. It’s not the self-service
kiosks that are the problem. It’s you.

For starters, you’re clearly unable to follow directions. When you buy an
apple, you put the apple in the bag which needs to be on the designated place
to the side of the kiosk where there’s a scale underneath so the machine can

this isn’t the oil company’s biggest problem.

BP has emerged from an embarrassing misconduct scandal with a new leadership
team, but questions remain about its future strategy, and pressure is growing
for the board to abandon its green commitments and increase production of
fossil fuels.

            <p>One-way video interviews, CV screeners and digital monitoring are among the
ways employers are using tech to save time and money on recruitment. But do
they work?

Investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the world of work,
Hilke Schellmann thought she had better try some of the tools. Among them was
a one-way video interview system intended to aid recruitment called
myInterview. She got a login from the company and began to experiment – first
picking the questions she, as the hiring manager, would ask and then video
recording her answers as a candidate before the proprietary software analysed
the words she used and the intonation of her voice to score how well she
fitted the job.

She was pleased to score an 83% match for the role. But when she re-did her
interview not in English but in her native German, she was surprised to find
that instead of an error message she also scored decently (73%) – and this
time she hadn’t even attempted to answer the questions but read a Wikipedia
entry. The transcript the tool had concocted out of her German was gibberish.
When the company told her its tool _knew_ she wasn’t speaking English so had
scored her primarily on her intonation, she got a robot voice generator to
read in her English answers. Again she scored well (79%), leaving Schellmann
scratching her head.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The hacker whose involvement with anti-piracy software ended in a jail
sentence has emerged from prison struggling to make rent as he starts paying
his fine. ‘It could be worse,’ he says

In April 2023, a 54-year-old programmer named Gary Bowser was released from
prison having served 14 months of a 40-month sentence. Good behaviour reduced
his time behind bars, but now his options are limited. For a while he was
crashing on a friend’s couch in Toronto. The weekly physical therapy sessions,
which he needs to ease chronic pain, were costing hundreds of dollars every
week, and he didn’t have a job. And soon, he would need to start sending
cheques to Nintendo. Bowser owes the makers of Super Mario $14.5m (£11.5m),
and he’s probably going to spend the rest of his life paying it back.

Since he was a child, Bowser’s life has revolved around tinkering with
electronics. His dad was a mechanical engineer, and he learned from him how to
wire up model trains and mod calculators. As a teenager he already had a
computer business: his mother died when he was 15, his father had retired and
Bowser supported him.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
