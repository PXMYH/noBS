But the routine monthly update on the health of the US jobs market has been
overshadowed by Donald Trump’s firing of the agency’s commissioner, Erika
McEntarfer, hours after July’s statistics were released last month.

As you board the plane, the flight attendant welcomes you on board. They point
you to your seat and help with your luggage, before giving the safety
demonstration, and preparing the plane for takeoff. And there’s a good chance
they have done it all for free.

But a tentative deal between Air Canada and thousands of flight attendants has
sparked hope more airlines will end a little-known reality for many North
American cabin crews – and pay flight attendants when planes are not moving.

levies on imports overstepped his powers

  * Business live – latest updates

Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to overturn a lower court decision
that most of his sweeping trade tariffs were illegal.

The US president filed a petition late on Wednesday to ask for a review of
last week’s federal appeals court ruling in Washington DC, which centred on
his “liberation day” border taxes introduced on 2 April that imposed levies of
between 10% and 50% on most US imports and sent shock waves through global
trade and markets.

            <p>Judge said tech giant had monopoly but let it keep Chrome and Android; critics
cried foul while Wall Street cheered

A judge ruled on Tuesday that Google would not be forced to sell its Chrome
browser or the Android operating system, saving the tech giant from the most
severe penalties sought by the US government. The same judge had ruled in
favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and
maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.

Groups critical of Google’s dominance in the internet search and online
advertising industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity
to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the
crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by
contrast, are thrilled. Shares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have
risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.

Growing up near Bolivia’s Uyuni salt flats, Franz Alí Ramos remembers playing
in the high-altitude wetlands near his home during the rainy season. “It was a
beautiful recreation area for us and for animals,” he says.

Now, the wetlands have given way to cracked, sunbaked earth – a change that
Alí Ramos blames on nearby operations by Bolivia’s state lithium corporation,
Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB). The government has recently signed
lithium mining contracts with two foreign companies – one Russian and the
other Chinese – and residents fear more serious damage is yet to come.

disputed territory

China is drilling for oil and gas inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), a move that analysts believe is likely part of Beijing’s unilateral
grab for disputed territory that could also aid a future invasion of Taiwan.

During July and August at least 12 oil and gas vessels and permanent
structures were detected inside Taiwan’s EEZ – including one within 50km of
the restricted-waters border of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands – as well
as several steel supports for fixed offshore drilling platforms, called
jackets. Their presence inside Taiwan’s EEZ have not been previously reported.

The tide has turned. The great migration – when the shift to remote work
prompted people to quit their jobs in droves – is officially over. Now comes
the big hold.

According to a new survey from consulting firm Robert Half, 73% of respondents
– workers at companies – said they plan to stay in their current roles through
2025. They gave reasons like having “positive company culture” and “feeling
professionally fulfilled” or “being well compensated” at their current job.
But there’s also a fourth reason why so many are staying put: the job market
isn’t great and people are worried.

It was supposed to be a simple rebrand – or so Cracker Barrel thought.

Earlier this month, the 56-year-old southern restaurant chain known for its
country-store charm and nostalgic Americana aesthetic unveiled a new look: a
minimalist logo, more modern interiors and a handful of new menu items.

            <p>Regulator Easa concludes there is not enough evidence it is as safe as flying
with two pilots as currently required

Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the
cockpit have been put on ice after a report for the European regulator
suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”
commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) found that despite
advances in technology there was not sufficient evidence that flying with a
single pilot could be as safe as with the two currently required.

            <p>Republicans once believed governments should get out of the way. Trump is

When Ronald Reagan became the first US president to address China’s Great Hall
of the People in 1984, he did not waste an opportunity to school his audience
on the benefits of the American way.

He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party
– that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and
markets the space the thrive, without intervention – into a simple mantra:

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
