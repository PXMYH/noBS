The US president told reporters late on Tuesday the taxes on drug imports

When Elon Musk advised Germans to vote for the far-right Alternative für
Deutschland (AfD) in elections last year, Manu Hoyer – who lives in the small
town where the billionaire had built Tesla’s European production hub – wrote
to the state premier to complain.

on the US economy
