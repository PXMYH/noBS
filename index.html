            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Thanks to poor engineering and Elon Musk, Tesla’s road rage-inducing street
tank can’t even win over its core demographic: doomsday preppers

The Cybertruck answers a question no one in the auto industry even thought to
ask: what if there was a truck that a Chechen warlord couldn’t possibly pass
up – a bulletproof, bioweapons-resistant, road rage-inducing street tank
that’s illegal to drive in most of the world?

Few had seen anything quite like the Cybertruck when it was unveiled in 2019.
Wrapped in an “ultra-hard, 30X, cold-rolled stainless steel exoskeleton”, the
Cybertruck was touted as the ultimate doomsday chariot – a virtually
indestructible, obtuse-angled, electrically powered behemoth that can repel
handgun fire and outrun a Porsche while _towing _a Porsche, with enough juice
leftover to power your house in the event of a blackout. At the launch,
Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, said the truck could tackle any terrain on Earth __
and possibly also on Mars – and all for the low, low base price of $40,000.
“Sometimes you get these late-civilization vibes [that the] apocalypse could
come along at any moment,” Musk said. “Here at Tesla, we have the best in
apocalypse technology.”

            <p>Kroger stores in multiple states have overcharged customers by listing expired
sale tags and then ringing up regular prices – a practice that adds extra
burdens on struggling US families

Derek and Allison Hadfield became more and more fed up whenever they shopped
for their family of four at their local Kroger grocery in Belpre, Ohio, a town
of about 6,600 across the Ohio River from West Virginia.

When they tried to save money by buying stuff on sale, they said, many of the
discounts vanished when Kroger rang up their carts at checkout. Personal
pizzas posted as on sale for $1 a piece rang up for $1.25 each. An 8oz jar of
minced garlic listed at the low price of $2.49 cost $3.99 at checkout – a 60%
jump.

European companies are increasingly lobbying for strong climate action,
research has found, in a “profound shift” that analysts say challenges the
narrative that businesses see green rules as a threat to profits.

The share of companies whose corporate lobbying is “aligned” with pathways to
meet global climate goals rose from 3% in 2019 to 23% in 2025, according to an
analysis of 200 of the largest European companies by InfluenceMap, while the
share of companies who were deemed “misaligned” fell from 34% to 14%.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
