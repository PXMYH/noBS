            <p>President Donald Trump says he would prefer not to impose tariffs on China,
citing tariffs as a &#34;tremendous power&#34; over the country. Despite his softer
tone, analysts believe Trump is unlikely to back down from his tariff threats,
with a lot at stake for China and the global economy. Billionaire Elon Musk
scrutinized the red tape entangling the Air Force One revamp in late December,
according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Boeing suffered
another quarter of fresh charges and losses as the company announced sales at
$15.2 billion, less than the $16.76 billion expected by Wall Street. The

Joe Erlinger did not mince his words. “This lopsided, hypocritical and ill-

that it had allowed thousands of imports from Chinese companies blacklisted
for their alleged links to Uyghur workers.

Guardian Australia revealed on Monday that Australia had received thousands of
imports from Chinese companies blacklisted by the United States over alleged
links to Uyghur forced labour.

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on

the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their

            <p>Outgoing agency head was a determined antitrust enforcer during her tenure,
but some detractors say she was a bully with unchecked power

Lina Khan was installed as the US’s top antitrust watchdog with a mandate to
turn the page on an era of light-touch enforcement. According to her critics,
Khan was a “bully” with “unchecked power”. But, by her reckoning, this new era
brought “off the charts” success.

In Silicon Valley and beyond, industry leaders argue she went too far. Some
officials inside the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complained the agency was
hamstrung by mismanagement. And now, as Khan prepares to step down, her
successor has made no secret of his plan to break with her agenda.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
