Now they’re preparing to fight back.

Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, said it was gearing up to challenge the
US president’s “Billionaire First” agenda in 2026 – and drive candidates in
key elections to stand up for “struggling” Americans.

the idea that people should buy physical gold and put it into their pension
pots.

Farage is paid more than four times his MPs’ salary for the four-hour-a-month
job at Direct Bullion, where he has featured in Facebook and YouTube videos.

            <p>Tashkent Supermarket’s new West Village location offers staples like _plov_
and _samsas_ hot and fresh – a taste of Central Asia for everyone

When I first stepped into the Tashkent Supermarket in Brighton Beach, I could
barely get around. The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling
faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods like _manty_ –
intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on
where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Or _chak-chak_ , a
dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey
syrup. _Kompot,_ too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.

Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home.
_Manty_ was one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she
was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin,
yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to
have soda or sugary drinks, but homemade _kompot_ with fruits and berries from
our garden was an exception. And though I never mastered _chak-chak_ , the
store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across
other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always find
_plov_ and _samsas_ at eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.

One tries to give people the benefit of the doubt. But now, when it comes to
Bari Weiss as the editor in chief of CBS News, there is no longer any doubt.  
  
A broadcast-news neophyte, Weiss has no business in that exalted role. She
proved that beyond any remaining doubt last weekend, pulling a powerful and
important piece of journalism just days before it was due to air, charging
that it wasn’t ready. Whatever her claims about the story’s supposed flaws,
this looks like a clear case of censorship-by-editor to protect the interests
of powerful, rich and influential people.

The 60 Minutes piece – about the brutal conditions at an El Salvador prison
where the Trump administration has sent Venezuelan migrants without due
process – had already been thoroughly edited, fact-checked and sent through
the network’s standards desk and its legal department. The story was promoted
and scheduled, and trailers for it were getting millions of views.

Industry leaders say thousands of farms will still go bust this year.

While the US president has vowed to increase domestic farm production, and
even claimed this formed a “big part” of his plan to lower grocery prices for
Americans, many US farmers are grappling with mounting financial issues –
compounded by Trump’s agenda.

earlier, billionaires invest in anti-ageing

There’s a weird disconnect to the public debate about health in the United
States. In January, millions of Americans may drop their health insurance as
premiums skyrocket following the Trump administration’s decision to end
federal subsidies that helped some 20 million people afford insurance on the
Obamacare marketplaces.

Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress agreed to cut more than $850bn from
the 10-year budgets of Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income
people, and the Chip health insurance program for children, in order to pay
for some tax cuts. Given the US’s budgetary rules, that cut means an
additional $500bn in funding for Medicare is at risk.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
