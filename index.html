On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor
Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out
“know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables.
Several vendors mentioned they were scared after watching videos of
immigration raids across the city.

“We used to go around helping vendors apply for permits so they wouldn’t get
fined,” said Eric Nava-Pérez, Street Vendor Project’s Spanish-speaking member
organizer. “But now, we’re out here distributing immigration rights
information.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Artificial intelligence could make income inequality even worse and create a
new underclass. Governments and society must take action

Nowadays there seems to be nonstop discussion about AI, with much of the
conversation focused on whether there’s a speculative bubble or whether the
chipmaker Nvidia is really worth $5tn or whether OpenAI will beat its rivals
in developing new generations of artificial intelligence. But the vast
majority of Americans – just like the vast majority of Europeans and Asians –
couldn’t care less about those things.

Their big concern is whether AI is going to cause huge layoffs and create a
disastrous job market, especially for younger workers. Dario Amodei, CEO of
Anthropic, a leading AI company, fed those fears when he said that AI could
wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five
years and increase unemployment in the US to 10% to 20%. In October, Bernie
Sanders, the top Democrat on the Senate education and labor committee, issued
a report saying AI and automation could replace up to 97m jobs in the US over
the next decade.

workplace, as well as economic and legal issues

Britain’s economy shrank unexpectedly in October as consumers held back on
spending before Rachel Reeves’s budget, and car manufacturing struggled to
recover from the cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed gross domestic
product fell by 0.1%, after a 0.1% drop in output in September. City

            <p>After top editor Bari Weiss made outreach to anchors at other networks, CBS
News decided to go with an internal candidate

One of Bari Weiss’s top priorities as editor in chief of CBS News has been to
chart a future for the network’s sagging evening news broadcast, which has
languished behind its competitors on NBC and ABC. On Wednesday, Weiss promoted
Tony Dokoupil, the co-host of the network’s morning show, to serve as the next
anchor of CBS Evening News starting 5 January.

In her first few weeks on the job, Weiss expressed interest in a handful of
top anchors from rival networks, including Bret Baier and Dana Perino at Fox
News, but both are locked into long-term contracts. Looking internally,
Dokoupil, 44, was seen as a strong contender, along with Norah O’Donnell, who
anchored the show from 2019 to 2025.

The distress call went out to the Canadian coast guard station after midnight
on an October night. The Nathan E Stewart, an American-flagged tugboat,
sailing through the light winds and rain of the central British Columbia
coast, had grounded on a reef.

The captain tried to reverse, moving the rudder from hard over port to hard
over starboard. The boat pivoted but did not move, and the tug repeatedly
struck the sea bed.

coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a
small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.

The French luxury retail emporium opened its first New York outlet earlier
this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels
like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along
with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks
while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and
reds, is reminiscent of a Wes Anderson movie set.

  * Business live – latest updates

Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined €120m (£105m) after it
was found in breach of new EU digital laws, in a ruling likely to put the
European Commission on a collision course with the US billionaire and
potentially Donald Trump.

The breaches, under consideration for two years, included what the EU said was
a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of
transparency of the platform’s advertising.

The EU is considering legally forcing industries to reduce purchases from
China to insulate Europe from future hostile acts, the industry commissioner,
Stéphane Séjourné, says.

He made his remarks as the European Commission unveiled a €3bn (£2.63bn)
strategy to reduce its dependency on China for critical raw materials amid a
global scramble caused by Beijing’s “weaponisation” of supplies of everything
from chips to rare earths.

            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
