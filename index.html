            <p>European gas futures rose to the highest since December after a period of
intense fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, which hosts a key gas intake point.
The incursion is Ukraine’s largest assault on Russian territory since Vladimir
Putin ordered the 2022 invasion of his neighboring country. Oil prices
steadied as markets remain on edge over a possible retaliatory strike by Iran
on Israel as payback for assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. In the
UK, anti-racism protesters turned out in their thousands in towns and cities
to counter far-right demonstrations that failed to materialize on Wednesday

houses fret over stalling demand

After years of global growth, the luxury industry is facing a new foe:
“underconsumption”. On TikTok, #underconsumptioncore emerges as a trending
topic, as the next generation of potential shoppers swap tips on how to look
good while buying and spending less. The entire sector is struggling as
consumers wince at luxury prices, and are left bemused by the rapid turnaround
of designers.

Last week, shares in Kering, owner of luxury labels including Gucci,
Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, hit a seven-year low
after reporting that operating income in the second half of the year would be
down 30% after a 42% drop in the first half.

Jenny Björklund was out on an island in Finland’s Åland archipelago with a

friend, who was visiting from Gothenburg in Sweden, that they would be left
alone.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come here because we are here. This is our island,”
Björklund, a co-owner of a restaurant and distillery on the archipelago, says
she told her friend. Sure enough, she was right.

illegal miners pouring into Yanomami reserves

In the back yard of the federal police headquarters in Roraima, the
northernmost state of Brazil, giant sacks lie strewn and overflowing with a
jet-black, gravel-like mineral: cassiterite. Although less high-profile than
other items seized during a crackdown on illegal mining in this Amazon state –
including a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter painted in the colours of the Brazilian
flag – cassiterite has become so sought-after that it is nicknamed “black
gold”.

Cassiterite is the chief ore of tin, a less heralded but critical mineral for
the energy transition. It is used in coatings for solar panels, lithium-ion
batteries and solder for electronics, including wind turbines, mobile phones,
computers and industrial alloys.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
