            <p>Live coverage of business, economics and financial news as ECB cuts main
interest rate by 0.25 percentage points in effort to support growth

It was a flash reading on the Eurozone economy, so we don’t have the details
on what the drivers were. But it’s clear that it was a weak end to 2024.

But the European Central Bank might be able to spur a bit of economic growth
in the eurozone with looser monetary policy.

This marks a weak end to last year, following positive growth in the first
three quarters of 2024. As a result, first estimates suggest that the currency
bloc as a whole grew by 0.7% in 2024. Declining activity in Germany – the
Eurozone’s largest economy – has weighed on the bloc’s growth, with German GDP
contracting by 0.2% on the quarter. This suggests Germany has now seen annual
declines in activity for two consecutive years.

In 2025, further loosening of monetary conditions is expected to provide a
modest uptick in activity for both Germany and the Eurozone, with growth
expected to amount to 0.3% and 1.0% respectively.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Settlement originates from lawsuit by president against the platform, one of
several filed after 6 January violence

Meta has agreed to pay $25m to settle a lawsuit with Donald Trump. The suit
originated in 2021 when Trump sued the social media company for suspending his
accounts after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The settlement was
first reported by the Wall Street Journal and has been confirmed by a Meta
spokesperson.

The majority of the settlement, $22m, will go toward a fund to pay for Trump’s
presidential library, according to the Wall Street Journal. The remainder will
pay for legal fees and go to other plaintiffs listed in the case. The White
House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

24 January: Target said it would stop its anti-discrimination efforts,
including participation in external surveys, such as one run by the Human
Rights Campaign, which tracks LGBTQ+ inclusive corporate policies such as
spousal and domestic partner benefits and outreach to communities. The company

Black- and minority-owned businesses, among other changes.

By Monday, DeepSeek’s AI assistant had rapidly overtaken ChatGPT as the most
popular free app in Apple’s US and UK app stores. Despite its popularity with
international users, the app appears to censor answers to sensitive questions
about China and its government.

What happened on June 4, 1989 at Tiananmen Square?

What happened to Hu Jintao in 2022?

Why is Xi Jinping compared to Winnie-the-Pooh?

What was the Umbrella Revolution?

Tesla has filed a complaint against the European Commission after the
imposition of tariffs by the bloc on its Chinese-made electric vehicles.

The EU announced its decision to impose tariffs on all imports of Chinese
electric cars in June, alleging that the Chinese government had provided

Within his first few days in office, Donald Trump reversed four years of work
to increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the federal
government.

Since taking office, he’s signed a flurry of executive orders, two of which
amount to crackdowns on DEI within the federal government. One overturns Joe
Biden’s efforts to increase DEI programs in the federal government, while a
second bans DEI measures from being taken by the federal government.

Donald Trump, a self-declared “big believer” in tariffs on foreign goods, has
promised to use them to boost the US economy, revitalize America’s industrial
heartlands, and reward the tens of millions of voters who sent him back to the
White House.

“Come make your product in America,” the president told top executives
gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, promising low taxes
to those who take him up on the invitation. “But if you don’t make your
product in America – which is your prerogative – then, very simply, you will
have to pay a tariff.”

From a modern control room high above the canal expansion – overlooking the
Cocolí locks, then lakes, rainforest canopy and, eventually, the Atlantic
ocean – it barely registers that the era of gunboat diplomacy is returning to
the Panama canal.

But four days into Donald Trump’s second administration, here we are. Trump
has declared that he is “taking back” the Panama canal, sending TV crews from
Washington to Beijing scrambling here to cover a crisis that has led to
frenzied diplomatic efforts and elicited fears of a repeat of the 1989 US
military invasion.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
