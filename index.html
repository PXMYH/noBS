Hundreds of people protested at Tesla dealerships across the US over the
weekend, as the backlash against Elon Musk and the Trump administration
continued despite a warning from the attorney general that the government
would be “coming after” protesters.

The protests, in cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston and New
York, have come as Musk has seen his net worth plunge and the sales of Teslas
plummet in Europe. In Brooklyn, New York, about 50 people gathered outside a
Tesla showroom on Saturday afternoon to loudly make their displeasure clear,
the fourth such protest in the last four weeks.

Edelman, the world’s largest public relations agency, is in talks to work with
the Cop30 team organising the UN climate summit in the Amazon later this year
despite its prior connections to a major trade group accused of lobbying to
roll back measures to protect the area from deforestation, the Guardian and
the Centre for Climate Reporting can reveal.

The summit is set to take place in November in the city of Belém on the edge
of the Amazon rainforest, which has been ravaged by deforestation linked to
Brazil’s powerful agriculture industry. For the first time, the talks will be
“at the epicenter of the climate crisis”, the summit’s president wrote last
week. “As the Cop comes to the Amazon, forests will naturally be a central
topic,” he added.

its pricing power.

Americans are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul
the US economy with sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, according to an
exclusive poll for the Guardian, despite the US president’s efforts to
downplay the risks of his strategy.

“Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on
Thursday, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country.

90% of Democrats and 69% of independents said they are concerned about
tariffs, compared to 57% of Republicans.

89% of Democrats and 75% of independents said they are concerned about a
potential recession in the US, compared to 65% of Republicans.

            <p>Women’s goods are taxed at a higher rate than men’s, an invisible bias that is
estimated to cost women $2.5bn a year

Many shoppers know about the so-called pink tax – a needless markup on
products marketed to women, even if those products are essentially the same,
just cheaper, when sold to men. Personal care items such as razors, deodorants
and shampoo fall into this category. But shoppers may be less aware of “pink
tariffs”, or taxes on imported goods labeled as “women’s items”.

Pink tariffs are one reason women’s clothing tends to cost more than men’s at
the checkout counter, and why some women might buy sweatpants or oversized
sweaters technically made for “men” – it could save them some cash.

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
