Law enforcement agencies are on the hunt for a man accused of stealing
millions from property market investors as police warn Australians to be on
guard against “pig butchering” scams before Valentine’s Day.

A Victorian man is alleged to have fleeced wannabe property market investors
of $8.7m by claiming to be a developer who offers to help people demolish
their homes and build townhouses in their place.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Even as more job cuts await, some analysts see the beginnings of a bull market
in the coming season of earnings reports

Will 2024 be a boom or a bust for big tech? By one estimate, there have been
more than 7,500 layoffs in the sector since the start of the year – a
dispersal of pink slips that many hoped would have ceased after the deep job
cuts of 2023.

However, as the US’s big tech earnings season gets under way this week, some
analysts are predicting strong numbers. This batch of quarterly financial
results may show that the industry has cleared out its pandemic-era overhiring
and reorganised itself around cloud computing and AI - necessitating cuts in
sectors with less rosy prospects. Analysts keen on AI say we are at the start
of a tech bull market.

Early adopters remember that heady time. Introduction by _Merritt K_

Today it is trivially easy to play games on a computer, games console or phone
with your friends over the internet. But before the wide availability of high-
speed internet, things were more complicated.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, 3D graphics in video games were becoming more
and more complex, but the low network speeds of the period meant that these
games, unlike slower-paced and less graphically intensive strategy games, were
nearly unplayable over an internet connection. In this moment, in which
communications technology was being outpaced by graphical power, the Lan
(local area network) party was born.

            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Shoes are notoriously hard to recycle and the vast majority are sent to
landfill. Can a new design help reduce the environmental impact of our
footwear?

The shoes may not immediately strike you as the future of mainstream fashion.
Pale and porous, they resemble a cross between a beige Croc and the long-net
stinkhorn fungus found on forest floors. Their creators, however, hope this
will be the next huge breakthrough in sustainable footwear: the world’s first
3D printed, made-to-measure, compostable shoe, which can be broken down at the
end of its life, in an attempt to stem the flow of millions of shoes into
landfill each year.

Fashion is among the world’s top polluting industries. It is responsible for
about 10% of global carbon emissions and consumes huge amounts of water and
land for production. Modern shoes are among the hardest items to produce
sustainably because of their complexity, say industry experts, and there are
few reliable statistics about the number manufactured every year for the
world’s 8 billion humans. There is an almost total dearth of statistics about
their environmental impact.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions

keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
