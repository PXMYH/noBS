            <p>Largest regional airline in North America also sued by flight attendant union
for alleged retaliatory firings

SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional airline in North America, is facing
legal action over an alleged “fake” company union that the airline operates
and the allegedly retaliatory firings of flight attendants who were engaged in
union organizing efforts.

A lawsuit was filed by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) in
October 2023. The US Department of Labor also filed a lawsuit last month
against the company’s inflight association over the “company union”, alleging
SkyWest Inflight Association (SIA) did not perform its legal duties as a
representative agency and barred two employees from running in an election for
leadership positions due to their support for an independent union at the
airline.

This story was amended on 14 August 2024 to correct that the US Department of
Labor filed a lawsuit against SkyWest Airlines’ inflight association, not
SkyWest Airlines itself. It also clarified that the Railway Labor Act, not the
National Labor Relations Act, governs airline employees.

            <p>Musk blames cyber-attack as conversation is delayed, resembling glitchy launch
of Ron DeSantis’s campaign

As a high-profile conversation between Donald Trump and Elon Musk was about to
begin, users of X, formerly Twitter, were confronted with the message: “This
Space is not available.”

Spaces, X’s livestreaming audio feature, was the chosen forum for the
dialogue, but it wasn’t working. Clicking on the link to the broadcast, hosted
by Trump’s dormant @RealDonaldTrump account, froze the site and rendered it
unusable. Tweeters said they couldn’t dial in; some said their browsers had
crashed.

childcare. In the UK, raising a child costs on average £223,256.

But those numbers can feel abstract. So, to get a better understanding of what
parenting costs really look like, we asked four sets of parents to break down
how much they spend on their child or children per month.

US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
