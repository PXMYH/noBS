            <p>The growing threat of fires has shaken the Napa valley wine industry, as fears
of smoke-spoiled grapes and soaring insurance rates put vintners on edge

Elton Slone and his colleagues at the Robert Craig Winery in Napa valley had
gathered for their annual pre-harvest company party last week – complete with
copper pot carnitas and grape tacos – when one of his co-workers noticed an
alert on her phone. The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles
(16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on
Howell Mountain.

Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blaze that damaged numerous wineries and
spoiled a year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel
remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the
week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for
the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property
to control the larger fire.

suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”
commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) found that despite
advances in technology there was not sufficient evidence that flying with a
single pilot could be as safe as with the two currently required.

on the benefits of the American way.

He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party
– that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and
markets the space the thrive, without intervention – into a simple mantra:
_trust the people_.

Donald Trump overstepped his presidential powers with most of his globe-

on Friday.

US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number
of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these
actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like,
or the power to tax”, the court said in the 7-4 ruling.
