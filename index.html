            <p>People want more seafood than the oceans can sustainably supply, so a German
firm aims to plug that gap with cultivated fish – but are consumers ready to
buy it?

The redbrick offices, just north of Hamburg’s River Elbe and a few floors
below Carlsberg’s German headquarters, are an unexpectedly low-key setting for
a food team gearing up to produce Europe’s first tonne of lab-grown fish.

But inside Bluu Seafood, past the slick open-plan coffee and cake bar, the
rooms are dominated by gleaming white tiles, people bustling about in lab
coats, rows of broad-bottomed beakers and pieces of equipment more at home in
a science-fiction thriller. A 50-litre tank (a bioreactor) is filled with what
looks like a cherry-coloured energy drink. The liquid, known as “growth
medium”, is rich with sugars, minerals, amino acids and proteins designed to
give the fish cells that are added to it the boost they need to multiply by
the million.

Google has been accused of throwing a “tantrum” after sacking more than 50
workers in response to a protest over the company’s military ties to the
Israeli government – firings that have shone a light on a controversial
project and long-simmering tensions between staff and management.

The workers were sacked following protests at Google offices in New York City
and Sunnyvale, California, organized by No Tech for Apartheid – an alliance of
Google and Amazon workers who have been protesting against a $1.2bn contract
with the Israeli government called Project Nimbus that they claim will make it
“easier for the Israeli government to surveil Palestinians and force them off
their land”.

            <p>The yen has been plumbing three-decade lows against the dollar, mainly because
interest rates in Japan remain much lower than those in the US and elsewhere,
diminishing the currency’s relative allure. After several failed efforts by
Japanese officials to talk the yen higher, the government appears to have
moved more decisively on April 29 to prop up the currency -- its first such
intervention since 2022.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
