• Business live – latest updates

Tesla’s board has approved the award of $29bn (£22bn) worth of shares to its
chief executive, Elon Musk, after a US court ruled against a previous pay deal
for the world’s richest person.

Musk will pay $2bn to buy 96m shares in the electric carmaker at the same
price per share as a 10-year pay package agreed in 2018, which is stuck in
legal limbo awaiting a court date for an appeal. The award was based on a
recommendation from a “special committee” of the board.

Donald Trump administration officials fanned out on Sunday’s US political

economic, trade and employment numbers that culminated with the firing of
labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer.

The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said Trump had “real concerns”
about the jobs numbers that extend beyond Friday’s report that showed the
national economy added 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. Job growth
numbers were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well.

As working from home became the norm for many people, Chapman was able to find
jobs for the foreign workers at hundreds of US companies, including some in

            <p>We must avoid inequalities between the global north and global south being
perpetuated in the digital age

I come from Trinidad and Tobago. As a country that was once colonized by the
British, I am wary of the ways that inequalities between the global north and
global south risk being perpetuated in the digital age.

When we consider the lack of inclusion of the global south in discussions
about artificial intelligence (AI), I think about how this translates to an
eventual lack of economic leverage and geopolitical engagement in this
technology that has captivated academics within the industrialised country I
reside, the United States.

            <p>Thanks to stockpiling, neither the markets nor consumers have been as badly
affected by the trade wars as feared. But signs of trouble are looming

Chaotic and unpredictable, keeping up with Donald Trump’s volatile trade war –
never mind his presidency – can be tough.

Back in April after his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, the talk was of
the president crashing the global economy. Then, after a Wall Street backlash,
the world learned the acronym “Taco”, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens
Out”. Now, things are heating up again.

The US’s largest companies have spent 2025 locked in a competition to spend
more money than one another, lavishing $155bn on the development of artificial
intelligence, more than the US government has spent on education, training,
employment and social services in the 2025 fiscal year so far.

Based on the most recent financial disclosures of Silicon Valley’s biggest
players, the race is about to accelerate to hundreds of billions in a single
year.

According to Donald Trump’s White House, the US economy is booming, inflation
is dead and jobs are surging. A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall
on such claims in recent days.

This week’s data on Trump’s early economic record was mixed – good, mad and
ugly – with jobs numbers so weak he reached for the catchphrase he once used
to build himself into a reality TV star: you’re fired.

The danger posed to Donald Trump was obvious. It was a story that not only
drew attention to his links to a convicted sex offender, it also risked
widening a growing wedge between the president and some of his most vociferous
supporters. The White House quickly concluded a full-force response was
required.

It was Tuesday 15 July. The Wall Street Journal had approached Trump’s team,
stating it planned to publish allegations that Trump had composed a crude poem
and doodle as part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th
birthday.

The US president claimed that Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor

election, in an effort to boost Kamala Harris’s chances of victory.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
