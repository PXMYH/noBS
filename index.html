            <p>Two recent US cases have found the search giant is functioning as an illegal
monopoly. This should be a turning point

In less than a year, US courts have ruled that the world’s most powerful tech
company broke the law – twice.

In August, a federal judge in Washington ruled that Google illegally
maintained its search monopoly by locking up defaults on browsers and devices.
In April, a federal judge in Virginia found that Google illegally monopolized
the digital advertising market, manipulating auctions, restricting and
stifling competitors. These two rulings, the most significant antitrust wins
against a tech giant in decades, should be a turning point in the digital
economy.

US postal workers – and many who depend on them – may have sighed in relief
when the Trump-appointed postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, resigned last month.
Now, postal workers and others fear the worst is to come.

Many feared DeJoy, a prolific Trump donor and trucking logistics executive who
pushed a 10-year consolidation plan at the agency, would be the man who would
finally dismantle the United States Postal Service (USPS). Now the service is
facing off with an empowered Trump and Elon Musk, his billionaire backer and
chainsaw-wielding leader of his government job-cutting “department of
government efficiency” (Doge).

British Steel will not continue with a consultation on making up to 2,700
steelworkers at its Scunthorpe plant redundant, after the government took
control of the firm earlier this month.

The Chinese company Jingye, which promised a “new chapter” when it bought
British Steel in 2020, last month proposed closing Scunthorpe’s two blast

produce steel from scratch.

  * Editorial: Donald Trump could cost the world $1tn

Donald Trump’s tariffs have unleashed a “major negative shock” into the world
economy, the International Monetary Fund has said, as it cut its forecasts for
US, UK and global growth.

In a stark assessment of the impact of the US president’s policies, as global

significant slowdown in global growth in the near term.”

US trade officials are preparing to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on imports

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
