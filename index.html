Oil and gas production in Texas is spewing out double the rate of methane, a
powerful greenhouse gas, than in the more regulated state of New Mexico, new
satellite data shared with the Guardian shows, prompting calls for tougher
curbs of “super-emitter” sites that risk tipping the world into climate
breakdown.

Satellite imaging of methane leaks across the Permian basin, a vast geological
feature at the heart of the US oil and gas drilling industry, show that sites
in Texas have emitted double the amount of the gas than in New Mexico, per
unit of production, since 2019.

UK economy”.

In an apparent swipe at those calling for the UK to develop a separate

BP’s fossil fuel projects in Azerbaijan have helped fund the military
aggression against Karabakh Armenians though the transfer to billions of
dollars to the Azerbaijan government since 2020, a campaign group has claimed.

Global Witness said Azerbaijan’s share of two large oil and gas projects
operated by the British oil company had earned its government more than four
times its military spending since 2020, the year that war broke out in the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.

            <p>Consumer groups issue formal notice to European Commission over ‘greenwashing’
claims that bottles are ‘100% recyclable’ or ‘100% recycled’

Big drinks companies are misleading customers with claims that their plastic
water bottles are fully recycled or recyclable, according to consumer groups
who have issued a formal complaint to the European Commission.

The Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC) said claims that water
bottles from brands owned by Coca-Cola, Danone and Nestlé are “100%
recyclable” or “100% recycled” are misleading because recycling rates are far
lower in practice and bottles contain items that cannot be made from recycled
material. The consumer rights group, which represents national groups across

environmental neutrality.

            <p>Company sought to present itself at the heart of myriad utopian ideals, in
pursuit of ‘mission’ to ‘elevate the world’s consciousness’

WeWork’s rapid rise transformed it into one of the world’s most feted
startups, valued at $47bn in 2019. Its fall has been faster. Just four years
after clinching that peak valuation, the business has filed for bankruptcy.

Dressed in the cloak of a technology company, WeWork turned out to be an
office rental business – one that was undone by problems of its own making and
finally by forces beyond its control.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
