funding deal and avoid an Oct. 1 shutdown, a task complicated by the
increasing animosity between the White House and Capitol Hill. Lawmakers
return to Washington today with 16 scheduled working days before the funding
deadline on the night of Sept. 30 -- and that assumes the Senate sticks to its
plan to work a few Fridays this month. (Source: Bloomberg)

During July and August at least 12 oil and gas vessels and permanent
structures were detected inside Taiwan’s EEZ – including one within 50km of

For this Labor Day, the Donald Trump administration has draped an enormous

“American Workers First.”

Trump was elected on promises, since repeatedly pledged, that he would fight
for workers and forgotten Americans. But many labor advocates say that Trump
has consistently put corporate interests first in his second term as he has
taken dozens of actions that hurt workers, often by cutting their pay or
making their jobs more dangerous.

The tide has turned. The great migration – when the shift to remote work
prompted people to quit their jobs in droves – is officially over. Now comes

According to a new survey from consulting firm Robert Half, 73% of respondents

2025. They gave reasons like having “positive company culture” and “feeling
professionally fulfilled” or “being well compensated” at their current job.
But there’s also a fourth reason why so many are staying put: the job market
isn’t great and people are worried.

            <p>The growing threat of fires has shaken the Napa valley wine industry, as fears
of smoke-spoiled grapes and soaring insurance rates put vintners on edge

Elton Slone and his colleagues at the Robert Craig Winery in Napa valley had
gathered for their annual pre-harvest company party last week – complete with
copper pot carnitas and grape tacos – when one of his co-workers noticed an
alert on her phone. The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles
(16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on
Howell Mountain.

Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blaze that damaged numerous wineries and
spoiled a year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel
remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the
week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for
the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property
to control the larger fire.

with two pilots as currently required

Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the
cockpit have been put on ice after a report for the European regulator
suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”

            <p>Republicans once believed governments should get out of the way. Trump is
making his influence felt in every corner of the American economy

US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
