            <p>Household-name companies are breaking up, an effort to appeal to investors who
want more streamlined businesses. A popular way to separate a company is
through a spinoff, which creates two public companies with different areas of
focus. The idea is to create value for investors in a tax-efficient way.
Spinoffs historically have yielded mixed results for the new entity and the
legacy business.

2023, a year that is certain to be the hottest ever recorded, providing a

of an agreement to end the era of fossil fuels.

The US’s status as the world’s leading oil and gas behemoth has only
strengthened this year, even amid warnings from Joe Biden himself over the
unfolding climate crisis, with the latest federal government forecast showing

The UK’s flagship trans-Pacific trade deal, which was presented as a
cornerstone of post-Brexit “global Britain”, will deliver even less benefit to
the economy than the tiny uplift that was previously predicted, according to
the Office for Budget Responsibility.

In a report accompanying last week’s autumn statement, the OBR said the UK’s
entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP) would add just 0.04% to GDP in the “long run”, which it
defines as after 15 years of membership.

Lachlan Murdoch has been chairman of News Corporation and Fox Corporation, the

finally officially handed the reins to him.

Beyond the titular changes, how much of a transition is in fact being made is
open to question. “I hope to continue an active role in the company,” the
elder Murdoch, 92, remarked during the company’s most recent annual
shareholders meeting.

            <p>Challenging each other to cage fights, building apocalypse bunkers – the
behaviour of today’s mega-moguls is becoming increasingly outlandish and
imperial

Even their downfalls are spectacular. Like a latter-day Icarus flying too
close to the sun, disgraced crypto-god Sam Bankman-Fried crashed and burned
this month, recasting Michael Lewis’s exuberant biography of the convicted
fraudster – Going Infinite – into the story of a supervillain. Even his
potential sentence of up to 115 years in prison seems more suitable for a
larger-than-life comic book character – the Joker being carted off to Arkham
Asylum – than a nerdy, crooked currency trader.

But that’s the way this generation of tech billionaires rolls. The Elon Musk
we meet in Walter Isaacson’s biography posts selfies of himself as Marvel
comic character Doctor Strange – the “Sorcerer Supreme” who protects the Earth
against magical threats. Musk is so fascinated with figures such as Iron Man
that he gave a tour of the SpaceX factory to the actor who plays him, Robert
Downey Jr, and the film’s director, Jon Favreau. As if believing he really has
acquired these characters’ martial arts prowess, in June Musk challenged
fellow übermensch Mark Zuckerberg to “a cage match” after Zuck launched an app
to compete with the floundering Twitter. Musk and Zuck exchanged taunts in the
style of superheroes or perhaps professional wrestlers. “I’m up for a cage
match if he is,” tweeted Musk. “Send Me Location,” responded Zuck from
Instagram’s Threads.

ageing process

You might think that 1,500 years after the first bottle was drunk there wasn’t
much more innovation left to be had in the rarefied world of champagne. You
would be wrong. The next big thing in the £6bn-a-year industry is: undersea
ageing.

Like so many of the world’s best innovations, it began by accident. In 2010, a
group of divers in Finland’s Åland archipelago came across the wreck of a ship
that sank in 1852 and were surprised to find 145 bottles of champagne 160ft
below the surface. Even more surprisingly, the bottles were still full and
tasted – in the words of a professor of food biochemistry – “incredible – I
have never tasted such a wine in my life”.

Arabia, UAE and other repressive regimes

Public trust in some of the world’s most repressive governments is soaring,
according to Edelman, the world’s largest public relations firm, whose
flagship “trust barometer” has created its reputation as an authority on
global trust. For years, Edelman has reported that citizens of authoritarian
countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and
China, tend to trust their governments more than people living in democracies
do.

But Edelman has been less forthcoming about the fact that some of these same
authoritarian governments have also been its clients. Edelman’s work for one
such client – the government of the UAE – will be front and center when world
leaders convene in Dubai later this month for the UN’s Cop28 climate summit.

            <p>The surprise sacking of the AI venture’s CEO was followed by a near mutiny at
the company and his reinstatement

OpenAI’s messy firing and rehiring of its powerful chief executive this week
shocked the tech world. But the power struggle has implications beyond the

“The AI that we’re looking at now is immature. There are no standards, no
professional body, no certifications. Everybody figures out how to do it,

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
