  * Donald Trump fraud trial ruling – live updates
  * How will Trump pay the penalties?

Donald Trump, his eldest sons and associates have been ordered to pay over
$350m by a New York judge who found them guilty of intentionally committing
financial fraud over the course of a decade.

“The frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience,” Judge
Arthur Engoron wrote in his decision. In a devastating blow for the former
president who had built his reputation as a successful real estate developer,
Engoron barred Trump and two other executives from serving as officers or
directors of any corporation or entity in New York for three years. His sons,
Eric and Donald Trump Jr, were banned for two years.

  * Full report: Trump ordered to pay over $350m in New York fraud case
  * Trump fraud trial ruling – live updates

In a matter of weeks, Donald Trump was hit with two giant penalties from two
civil trials in New York – $83m for defamation against the writer E Jean
Carroll and $354.9m for inflating the value of his assets on government
financial statements.

The verdicts combined will cost him some $438m, and that’s only part of what
Trump could owe across numerous lawsuits. The payments will probably create a
sizable dent in his wallet. Bloomberg’s billionaires’ list estimated that
Trump’s net worth in 2021 was about $2.3bn, meaning these two rulings alone
could take out almost a fifth of Trump’s net worth.

“Rome is now the city of luxury hotels,” said Giuseppe Botrugno as he served

the humble bar and eatery for affordable, no-nonsense Roman fare.

“There is one opposite, one around the corner, and another planned next door
to that one,” added Botrugno, who along with his brother has run Bar San
Marcello on Via di San Marcello, a narrow street close to the Trevi fountain,

            <p>While the Red Sea resort of Dahab draws those who earn dollars and can work
anywhere, a third of Egyptians live in poverty and see a perilous voyage to
Europe as their only hope

Bordered by the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, Egypt is a country blessed with
many miles of coastline, and its resorts have long been tourist favourites.
But in a country in which the divide between rich and poor has always been
stark, Egypt’s recent economic woes have had a seismic effect on society – and
nowhere illustrates that better than the fortunes of those making their way to
the country’s two coasts.

Along the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba, the once-quiet fishing outpost of Dahab has
become a haven for well-off young digital nomads. Its warm turquoise waters
and hipster vibes have transformed the small town into a popular diving
resort, making it the perfect location for those looking for a more flexible

as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing

I run a small business. My company sells customer relationship management
(CRM) software to other businesses. I’m always in search of leads and will try
just about anything to find new clients that we can help. To that end, I
recently wrote a book about CRM and created a landing page on my website where
people – clients and prospects – can download it. How to promote my new book?
Why not X?

I know the X community – and its famous CEO – may not be everyone’s cup of
tea. But I’ve been a longtime active user and I’m sure there are many other
Xers who would enjoy reading my book. So I decided to conduct an experiment
and create a post with a link to my book’s landing page and promote it on the
social platform. Not a big promotion. Just 50 bucks over five days. A
pittance. But, for me, what happened is a cautionary tale.

Plastic producers have known for more than 30 years that recycling is not an

has not stopped them from promoting it, according to a new report.

“The companies lied,” said Richard Wiles, president of fossil-fuel
accountability advocacy group the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI), which
published the report. “It’s time to hold them accountable for the damage

  * Business live – latest updates

The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed
households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis, in a heavy
blow to Rishi Sunak’s promise to kickstart growth.

The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a
larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in
all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to
Christmas.

sensitive data was offered for sale on forums

Three years ago, a man in Florida named JL decided, on a whim, to send a tube
of his spit to the genetic testing site 23andMe in exchange for an ancestry
report. JL, like millions of other 23andMe participants before him, says he
was often asked about his ethnicity and craved a deeper insight into his
identity. He said he was surprised by the diversity of his test results, which
showed he had some Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.

JL said he didn’t think much about the results until he learned of a huge
breach at the company that exposed the data of nearly 7 million people, about
half of the company’s customers. Worse, he later learned of a hacker going by
the pseudonym “Golem” who had offered to sell the names, addresses and genetic
heritage reportedly belonging to 1 million 23andMe customers with similar
Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on a shadowy dark web forum. Suddenly, JL worried
his own flippant decision to catalog his genes could put him and his family at
risk.

            <p>The new ‘mixed-reality’ headset gave me a glimpse of the future – and I’m not
sure it’s a future we should want

If you ever worry that technology might be getting a little too intelligent
and robots are poised to take over the world, I have a quick and easy way to
deflate those fears: call up a company and try to ask them a simple question.
You will be put through to an automated voice system and spend the next 10
minutes yelling NO, I DIDN’T SAY THAT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN ‘YOU DIDN’T QUITE
CATCH THAT?’ I DON’T WANT ANY OF THOSE OPTIONS! PUT ME THROUGH TO A HUMAN,
GODDAMMIT!

That was certainly my experience calling up Apple and trying to reconfirm my
Vision Pro demo, which had been abruptly cancelled due to snow. But if my
phone experience felt ancient, the Apple Vision Pro headset itself felt like a
startling glimpse of the future. As it should: the thing costs $3,499.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Datacentres are part of Ireland’s vision of itself as a tech hub. There are
now more than 80, using vast amounts of electricity. Have we entrusted our
memories to a system that might destroy them?

In the doldrum days between Christmas and New Year, we take a family trip to
see a datacentre. Over the past two decades, datacentres have become a common
sight on the outskirts of Dublin and many other Irish cities and towns.
Situated in industrial business parks, they are easy to miss. But these
buildings are critical to the maintenance of contemporary life: inside their
walls stand rows and rows of networked servers; inside the servers, terabytes
of data flow.

It’s a seven-minute drive from where we live now in Artane, Dublin, to the
Clonshaugh datacentre, situated in a business park behind Northside shopping
centre. Although we live close by, we haven’t driven this way before, and our
route takes us through a number of the local authority estates that my husband
lived in as a boy. These estates are set on either side of a long, straight
road pocked with chicanes to deter joyriders. Even though the housing
development sprawls for miles on either side – with large wind-blasted green
spaces in between – the houses huddle, squashed together. It looks as if
someone has transplanted a warren of inner-city Victorian terraces to this
desolate terrain.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
