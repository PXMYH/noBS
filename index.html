            <p>Four years after workers at a Starbucks store in upstate New York became the
first to unionize, hundreds of outlets followed – defying intense resistance
from the coffee chain. What happened next?

Thousands of Starbucks baristas are on strike across the US, warning the
world’s largest coffee chain to brace for the “longest and biggest” bout of
industrial action in its history.

Barely a year after Brian Niccol, the Starbucks CEO, tried to draw a line

As the battle lines harden amid Germany’s intensifying pressure on the
European Commission to scrap the 2035 ban on production of new petrol and
diesel cars, two Swedish car companies, Volvo and Polestar, are leading the
campaign to persuade Brussels to stick to the date.

They argue such a move is a desperate attempt to paper over the cracks in the
German car industry, adding that it will not just prolong take up of electric
vehicles but inadvertently hand the advantage to China.

  * Politics live –latest updates

Britain’s budget watchdog has said the early leak of its budget documents

  * Business live –latest updates

Switzerland’s federal prosecutor has filed charges against the failed bank
Credit Suisse and its new owner, UBS, over the long-running “tuna bonds” loan
scandal that crashed Mozambique’s economy nearly a decade ago.

The Swiss attorney general said on Monday that it had brought money-laundering
charges against an unnamed employee of Credit Suisse, but was also taking
action against the lender and its rival-turned-owner UBS.

weekend of flight disruption

Airbus has fixed most of its jets affected by a software glitch after a
technical problem grounded thousands of its planes, but its shares tumbled on
Monday after it discovered a separate issue with its fuselage panels.

Airlines around the world cancelled and delayed flights over the weekend after
the French plane manufacturer ordered immediate repairs to 6,000 of its A320
family of jets, more than half of its global fleet.

TikTok finds and homemade gifts, trips to the mall and the endless search for
“dupes” – gen Z’s shopping habits are shaking up retail in the run-up to
Christmas. And with price tags climbing and brand loyalty slipping, retailers
this season must work harder to earn this generation’s dollar.

Gen Z’s spending power is expected to near $12tn by 2030. But this year those
aged 13 to 28 are expected to cut their holiday spending by a whopping 23% – a
sharper decline compared to other generations – according to a recent PwC
report.

            <p>Will the bubble ravage the economy when it bursts? What will it leave of value
once it pops?

The California Gold Rush left an outsized imprint on America. Some 300,000
people flocked there from 1848 to 1855, from as far away as the Ottoman
Empire. Prospectors massacred Indigenous people to take the gold from their
lands in the Sierra Nevada mountains. And they boosted the economies of nearby
states and faraway countries from whence they bought their supplies.

Gold provided the motivation for California – a former Mexican territory then
controlled by the US military – to become a state with laws of its own. And
yet, few “49ers” as prospectors were known, struck it rich. It was the
merchants selling prospectors food and shovels who made the money. One, a
Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss who sold denim overalls to the gold bugs
passing through San Francisco, may be the most remembered figure of his day.

“reinventors”, as the consultancy tries to position itself as a leader in
artificial intelligence.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
