being followed’ after analysis of social media posts by leading firms

As gambling companies target social media users, the four leading online
brands appear to be routinely breaching the industry’s self-imposed marketing
regulations, according to a new study.

Over one week this summer, academics at the University of Bristol found that

Seville province this week, officers from Spain’s Guardia Civil force

I’ve never had a pumpkin spice latte. It’s not because I have anything against
the seasonal bestseller from Starbucks, which has become an unofficial herald

The Brazilian supreme court has ordered that X be suspended in the country

representative in the country.

Late on Friday afternoon, Justice Alexandre de Moraes – who has been engaged
in a dispute with X’s owner, Elon Musk, since April – ordered the “immediate,

representative for the company is appointed in the country”.

            <p>Kwadjo Owusu-Ansah hasn’t even promoted his latest line of brightly colored
helmets, but ‘the most amazing people are finding them’

It was a zipper that propelled Kwadjo Owusu-Ansah’s project into motion.
“There was a flannel shirt I made with bleach,” the self-taught fashion
designer recalls, “and I hand-sewed the zipper on to the back of the shirt. I
think I fell in love, because almost everything I make has a zipper now.” That
device, and Owusu-Ansah’s fixation on it, were the seeds of Animated People,
his brand of innovative streetwear.

Owusu-Ansah – who goes by the name DamnKojo professionally and works full time
in marketing at a wine and spirits company – sees his fashion line as less of
an up-and-coming label than an ongoing art project. “I want you to tell your
own story,” Owusu-Ansah, 31, says. “Make your own meaning with my art. Dissect

to question the pieces when they see them. That’s what starts a conversation.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
