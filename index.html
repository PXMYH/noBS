High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced

Hewlett-Packard disputed with its auditors whether $5bn (£4bn) of a writedown
in value of the software firm Autonomy could be blamed on fraud allegedly
engineered by the tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch, according to documents filed
to a US court.

Lynch, a billionaire founder once lauded as the UK’s answer to Bill Gates, was
extradited to the US in May to face criminal fraud charges over allegations
that he duped HP into overpaying when it struck an $11bn deal for Autonomy in
2011.

Starbucks workers will strike at stores across the US on 16 November, the

company to bargain a first union contract with unionized stores and address
issues such as understaffing.

On Red Cup Day, Starbucks customers get a free limited edition reusable red
cup as a promotional event to kick off the holiday season. Starbucks’ 2022 Red
Cup Day was reportedly its highest single sales day ever despite strikes
affecting over 100 stores organized by the Starbucks Workers United union.

            <p>State oil company’s huge expansion plans make its CEO’s role as president of
UN climate summit ‘ridiculous’, say researchers

The state oil company of the United Arab Emirates, whose CEO will preside over
imminent UN climate negotiations, has the largest net-zero-busting expansion
plans of any company in the world, according to new data.

Sultan Al Jaber is the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company
(Adnoc) and president of the Cop28 summit, which begins on 30 November. The
researchers behind the new data said Adnoc’s huge planned expansion of oil and
gas production was a clear conflict of interest and they said his position was
“ridiculous”.

$170bn has been spent by the industry on exploration for new oil and gas
reserves since 2021.

96% of the 700 companies that explore or develop new oil and gas fields are
continuing to do so.

More than 1,000 companies are planning new gas pipelines, gas-fired power
plants or liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
