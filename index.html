            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Ahead of London fashion week, optimists believe new tools can open up an
industry that can be elitist – and costly to enter

The impact of artificial intelligence on the creative industries is a subject
that has prompted widespread anxiety about job losses and the death of
imagination, and the world of fashion is no exception.

But this month’s London fashion week, marking the event’s 40th anniversary,

            <p>‘It seems like something from the far-off future, but this threat is already
here,’ says chair of Federal Communications Commission

The US government on Thursday outlawed robocalls that use voices generated by
artificial intelligence, a decision that sends a clear message that exploiting
the technology to scam people and mislead voters won’t be tolerated.

The unanimous ruling by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) targets
robocalls made with AI voice-cloning tools under the Telephone Consumer
Protection Act, a 1991 law restricting junk calls that use artificial and
prerecorded voice messages.

Weight-loss treatments need to become cheaper and easier to take and lead to

In November, Britain’s biggest drugmaker struck an exclusive licence agreement
with Shanghai-based Eccogene, for an experimental drug called ECC5004 that
would also treat cardiometabolic conditions such as heart disease and stroke.
Obesity and diabetes affect more than 1 billion people globally.

The former chief executive of Barclays Jes Staley allegedly stayed in contact

Documents from a now-settled lawsuit, seen by Bloomberg News, allegedly

intermediary for messages between Staley and Epstein”, to stay in contact
after Staley took over as chief executive of Barclays in December 2015.

  * Business live – latest updates

China’s consumer prices fell at their fastest pace in 15 years in January, as
the world’s second-largest economy sank deeper into deflation amid weakening
demand.

Data released on Thursday showed that China’s consumer price index tumbled
last month, falling by 0.8% compared with a year earlier. It marks the fourth
consecutive month of declines, as well as the sharpest drop since September
2009, when the global economy was still grappling with aftershocks from the
2008 banking crisis.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite healthy sales, publishers such as Epic Games and Activision Blizzard
are making hundreds of employees redundant – which may radically reshape the
industry

It is widely agreed that 2023 was a stellar year for video games. The Legend
of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Baldur’s Gate 3, Alan Wake 2, Marvel’s Spider-
Man 2 … barely a week passed without some blockbuster hit or independent gem.

But beneath these accolades there is a sadder, more worrying story: it was
also a year of widespread industry redundancies, and the trend is continuing
into the opening weeks of 2024. Microsoft laid off 1,900 staff after its $69bn
purchase of Activision Blizzard. Publisher Embracer Group let at least 900
staff go across its many studios, as well as closing veteran UK developer Free
Radical Design. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, one of the most
successful titles of the decade, laid off 830 employees; Electronic Arts shed
6% of its workforce, amounting to approximately 780 jobs. There have been
similar grim stories from Ubisoft, Naughty Dog, Sega and Unity; major
publishers and smaller studios alike are being affected.

amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is

were an act of sabotage

Swedish prosecutors have said they will end their investigation into the
sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines in 2022, dodging the
question of who destroyed the then new energy link between Russia and Europe
shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

After a 16-month inquiry, the investigators concluded they did not have
jurisdiction in the case because Sweden’s citizens and interests had not been
harmed. “The conclusion of the investigation is that Swedish jurisdiction does

prosecution authority said on Wednesday.

The Danish company developing the world’s largest offshore windfarm in the

UK house prices rose 2.5% in the year to January, recording the biggest
increase since January last year, as lower mortgage rates and fading
inflationary pressures led to increased buyer and seller confidence, Halifax
has said.

January marked the fourth consecutive monthly rise, with a 1.3% uplift on
December, the UK’s biggest mortgage lender said, with the average home costing
£291,000, £3,900 more than in December.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Americans will stake $23bn on Sunday’s game as the NFL strengthens its ties
with the gambling industry. Many are worried about the human costs

For the first time, this year’s Super Bowl will take place in Las Vegas. And
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is aware that a gambling mecca and pro sports
teams could be a dangerous mixture: he issued a memo in the run-up to Sunday’s
game, reminding team personnel they should not even walk into a sportsbook,
let alone place a bet on the game.

For the general public it’s a very different story. The clash between the
Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers is expected to be the biggest
single-game betting event in US history. The American Gaming Association (AGA)
expects 26% of US adults will bet on the game for a combined total of $23bn.
That’s no surprise given the magnitude of the occasion and the explosive
growth of the sector since a 2018 US supreme court ruling cleared the path for
regulated sports gambling beyond Nevada.

Academics from around the world have urged India to cancel a huge construction
project on Great Nicobar Island, warning it would be “a death sentence” for
the Shompen hunter-gatherer people who live there.

The $9bn (£7bn) port project, planned to transform the Indian Ocean island of
8,000 inhabitants into what has been called the “Hong Kong of India”, includes
the construction of an international shipping terminal, airport, power plant,
military base and industrial park. It will also develop tourism.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
