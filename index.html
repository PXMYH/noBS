            <p>A Guardian study of past ticket prices for the men’s World Cup, compared with
current 2026 figures, shows how the barrier for entry has been raised for most
fans

In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation
hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and
Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.

An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid
the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of
those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based
on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available
starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025,
and do not include the 1.6% of sellable tickets for each game that Fifa
recently made available for a fixed $60 price.

  * Business live – latest updates

The Bank of England has cut interest rates by a quarter point, giving a pre-
Christmas boost to the struggling UK economy, but a split vote among its rate-
setters pointed to continued concerns about inflation.

The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) opted by five votes to
four to reduce its key base rate from 4% to 3.75%, signalling that it now
expects inflation to be “closer” to the 2% target in the first quarter of the
new year.

country. They make their way to shipping trucks, nearly full with hundreds of
boxes by the afternoon of a recent Thursday.

The 364,000 sq ft warehouse in the suburbs outside Chicago is just one of
Learning Resources’ investments in the US. The company and its affiliated
brands employ more than 500 people. They make about 2,000 different products,
mostly educational toys such as children’s binoculars, cash registers and

A who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are
forcing through a proposal for a huge datacenter in rural Michigan as locals
from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one
calling it “uniquely evil”.

Residents of Saline Township, Michigan, fear the $7bn center would jack up
energy bills, pollute groundwater and destroy the area’s rural character. The
1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help
derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.

been rendered toothless as employees grapple with corporations

On a cold January day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, workers at a Whole Foods
Market store in the heart of the city made history. Organizers won a vote to
form a union for the very first time in one of the grocery chain’s 530 US
stores.

Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, which has spent years quashing unionization
efforts within its sprawling empire. This result amounted to another blow in
the tech giant’s armor.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Artificial intelligence could make income inequality even worse and create a
new underclass. Governments and society must take action

Nowadays there seems to be nonstop discussion about AI, with much of the
conversation focused on whether there’s a speculative bubble or whether the
chipmaker Nvidia is really worth $5tn or whether OpenAI will beat its rivals
in developing new generations of artificial intelligence. But the vast
majority of Americans – just like the vast majority of Europeans and Asians –
couldn’t care less about those things.

Their big concern is whether AI is going to cause huge layoffs and create a
disastrous job market, especially for younger workers. Dario Amodei, CEO of
Anthropic, a leading AI company, fed those fears when he said that AI could
wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five
years and increase unemployment in the US to 10% to 20%. In October, Bernie
Sanders, the top Democrat on the Senate education and labor committee, issued
a report saying AI and automation could replace up to 97m jobs in the US over
the next decade.

workplace, as well as economic and legal issues

small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.

The French luxury retail emporium opened its first New York outlet earlier
this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels
like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along
with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks
while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and

Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined €120m (£105m) after it
was found in breach of new EU digital laws, in a ruling likely to put the
European Commission on a collision course with the US billionaire and
potentially Donald Trump.

The breaches, under consideration for two years, included what the EU said was
a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of
transparency of the platform’s advertising.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

            <p>Lauren Choi wanted to give plastic a second life. Her experiment turned into
The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
