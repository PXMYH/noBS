            <p>I’ve worked with family-owned businesses, and their internecine battles and
succession struggles ain’t great

Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, just made a very honest admission: “It is
true that a company’s not a family,” he said in a recent podcast interview.
“We used to refer to ourselves as a family, and then we did have to fire
people, or they’d have to leave the company, and you don’t fire members of
your family.”

Whenever a CEO says their employees are “family”, they’re lying. Your company
is not your family.

Why are we so obsessed with our lashes? Eva Wiseman reports on their history
and significance

Towards the end of the 19th century, women in Paris began sewing hairs on to
their eyelids. The _Dundee Courier_ detailed the procedure, which began with
rubbing the lower lid with cocaine before running a fine needle threaded with
hair from the head, “through the extreme edges of the eyelid… leaving its hair
thread in loops of carefully graduated length”. Long lashes had been
fashionable by then for some time, a symbol of youth and innocence, and by the
early 20th century a thriving industry in false lashes had emerged. “When a
fair young thing looks at you mistily through her long, curling lashes, do not
fall for it until you investigate,” warned one columnist in 1921. “The long,
curling eyelashes may not be hers, except by right of purchase.” Last year the
global eyelash extension market was valued at $1.66bn, expected to double by
2032, and industry trade body Beauty Guild estimates that 129,000 lash
treatments are carried out every week in the UK, making them the most popular
salon service in the country.

I’m thinking about the Parisian cocaine girls bleeding from their eyelids as I
approach the west London studio of Camilla Kirk Reynolds. She is on the
shortlist of recommended lash technicians I’ve compiled from beauty editors
and lash devotees, asking whose lashes last longest, who can offer both a
naturalistic lift and a Bambi-like visor, who can make me look, please, alive.
I ring on the bell and am shown through a quaint bookshop, downstairs to where
she shares treatment rooms with psychoanalysts. The bookshop, Camilla explains
lightly, is a front, their shared visitors preferring not to be seen seeking
therapy, beauty or otherwise.

            <p>Dr Pepper took the No 2 spot behind Coca-Cola last year. But the latest US
sales figures don’t tell the whole story

This month, the astonishing news broke that, after more than a century of
pitched battle – including ad skirmishes, frantic marketing, and taste tests
on both Earth and in space – the cola wars were officially over. Coca-Cola had
always been the winner, but its longtime rival, Pepsi, was no longer No 2.
Instead, a new challenger had climbed into second place: Dr Pepper.

The coup de grace was delivered by Beverage Digest, an Atlanta-based trade
publication that, in late May, released an updated ranking of the top 10 US
carbonated soft drink brands in 2023 based on sales volume. There, at the top,
was Coca-Cola Classic, with a 19.2% volume share of the market, followed by Dr

            <p>Isabella Weber, who linked corporate profits to inflation, shares how to
prevent food shortages – and price gouging

  * Tell us: how has inflation changed the way you grocery shop?

Isabella Weber, the economist who ignited controversy with a bold proposal to

Weber’s new paper, published on Thursday, looks at how grain prices spiked in
2022 as Covid snagged supply chains and Russia invaded Ukraine. The price

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
