            <p>Richard Howson’s job with Florida-based tech firm sparks anger among unions
and industry experts

The disgraced executive who led Carillion before the construction company’s
collapse has landed a senior role at a technology firm in Florida, only months
after he was banned from being a company director in the UK.

Richard Howson, who received an eight-year disqualification from the
Insolvency Service in October, has been named construction president at Tampa-
based TECfusions, the Guardian can reveal. The appointment sparked anger among
unions and industry experts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Shoes are notoriously hard to recycle and the vast majority are sent to
landfill. Can a new design help reduce the environmental impact of our
footwear?

The shoes may not immediately strike you as the future of mainstream fashion.
Pale and porous, they resemble a cross between a beige Croc and the long-net
stinkhorn fungus found on forest floors. Their creators, however, hope this
will be the next huge breakthrough in sustainable footwear: the world’s first
3D printed, made-to-measure, compostable shoe, which can be broken down at the
end of its life, in an attempt to stem the flow of millions of shoes into
landfill each year.

Fashion is among the world’s top polluting industries. It is responsible for
about 10% of global carbon emissions and consumes huge amounts of water and
land for production. Modern shoes are among the hardest items to produce
sustainably because of their complexity, say industry experts, and there are
few reliable statistics about the number manufactured every year for the
world’s 8 billion humans. There is an almost total dearth of statistics about
their environmental impact.

will host in December.

The move follows a backlash after the Guardian reported the initial 28-man
composition of the committee, which was called “regressive” by the She Changes
Climate campaign group. “Climate change affects the whole world, not half of
it,” the group said.

the prospect of making it freely available to the public.

The Meta chief executive has said the company will attempt to build an
artificial general intelligence (AGI) system and make it open source, meaning
it will be accessible to developers outside the company. The system should be
made “as widely available as we responsibly can”, he added.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday grilled Coinbase and the US
securities regulator about their divergent views on whether and when digital

to retirement and benefits in the first big union contract battle of 2024.

Five thousand workers, represented by the Teamsters at 12 Anheuser-Busch
breweries in the US, are threatening to strike after voting 99% in favor of a
strike authorization last month. Their current union contract is set to expire
on 29 February.

Tech companies could be asked to watermark or label content generated by
artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT as the federal government grapples
with “high risk” AI products evolving faster than legislation.

The industry and science minister, Ed Husic, will on Wednesday release the
government’s response to a consultation process on safe and responsible AI in
Australia, which cites McKinsey research to suggest adopting AI and automation
could increase Australia’s GDP by up to $600bn a year.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>From the generic hipster cafe to the ‘Instagram wall’, the internet has pushed
us towards a kind of global ubiquity – and this phenomenon is only going to
intensify

For most of the 2010s, I was a religious user of Yelp, an app for finding and
reviewing restaurants and other local businesses. The red-and-white interface
became a trusted source of recommendations when at home in New York or abroad.
In Berlin, Kyoto and Reykjavík, I searched for coffee shops, and quickly
scrolled through Yelp’s list, which was sorted by the cafes’ star rating – a
reflection of how much the app’s other users had liked each spot.

I often typed “hipster coffee shop” into the search bar as a shorthand because
Yelp’s search algorithm always knew exactly what I meant by the phrase. It was
the kind of cafe that someone like me – a western, twentysomething (at the
time), internet-brained millennial acutely conscious of their own taste –
would want to go to. Inevitably, I could quickly identify a cafe among the
search results that had the requisite qualities: plentiful daylight through
large storefront windows; industrial-size wood tables for accessible seating;
a bright interior with walls painted white or covered in subway tiles; and
wifi available for writing or procrastinating. Of course, the actual coffee
mattered, too, and at these cafes you could be assured of getting a cappuccino
made from fashionably light-roast espresso, your choice of milk variety and
elaborate latte art. The most committed among the cafes would offer a flat
white (a cappuccino variant that originated in Australia and New Zealand) and
avocado toast, a simple dish, also with Australian origins, that over the
2010s became synonymous with millennial consumer preferences. (Infamous
headlines blamed millennials’ predilection for expensive avocado toast for
their inability to buy real estate in gentrifying cities.)

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
