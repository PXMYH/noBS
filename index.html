When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

Qantas will fork out $100m as a civil penalty and pay $20m to customers in
compensation, after striking a deal with the consumer watchdog over landmark
legal action for allegedly selling tens of thousands of tickets to flights
that had already been cancelled in its system.

On Monday, Qantas announced it had come to an agreement with the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to resolve the court proceedings
lodged in August last year, alleging it had advertised and sold tickets for
more than 8,000 flights that it had already cancelled in its internal system,
revelations which precipitated the early retirement of the former CEO Alan
Joyce.

            <p>Influencers’ inventive recipes for high-protein dairy product have boosted
trade by 40% for one producer

If you peered into a UK fridge in the late 1970s, it is more than likely you
would have found a pot of cottage cheese tucked between the prawn cocktail and
sherry trifle.  
  
A popular “diet food” at the time, demand waned in subsequent decades as the
high-protein, low-fat wonder food fell out of fashion. But 50 years on from
its heyday, cottage cheese is making a comeback in the UK, and has become an
unlikely hit with health-conscious Gen Z.  
  
Driven by a wave of social media influencers sharing inventive recipes for the
dairy product, which is made from milk curds, UK retailers are reporting
significant increases in sales, while producers are struggling to keep up with
demand.  
  
“It’s come from absolutely nowhere,” said Robert Graham, managing director of
Graham’s Family Dairy. “Since May of last year, when there was a TikTok craze
that went on, cottage cheese sales for us are up 40%.”  
  
The company said the growth in production, the equivalent of an extra 2m
kilograms a year, means it is looking at ways to increase output, including an
initial growth plan to invest £5m to bolster its production facilities.  
  
“We are considering new factories because cottage cheese production is almost
full,” said Graham, whose company supplies big retailers such as Co-op,
Morrisons and Aldi.

Dairy company Arla is also benefiting from the cottage cheese rush, reporting
a double-digit increase in sales in the last three months, while Marks &amp;
Spencer experienced a 30% increase compared with last year, and Waitrose
reported a 22% year-on-year rise.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
