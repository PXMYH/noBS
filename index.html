Donald Trump’s strategy of imposing sweeping tariffs on America’s main trading
partners will face a major test in the US courts on Thursday, four days after
the president hailed the “powerful deal” reached with the EU and just hours

Boeing Co expects more than 3,200 union workers at three St Louis-area plants
that produce US fighter jets to strike after they rejected a proposed contract
on Sunday that included a 20% wage increase over four years.

The International Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said the vote by
District 837 members was overwhelmingly against the proposed contract. The
existing contract was to expire at 11.59pm central time on Sunday, but the
union said a “cooling off” period would keep a strike from beginning for
another week, until 4 August.

The Trump IRA (or individual retirement account) was established as a part of

Parents and employers can annually contribute up to $5,000 into an account for

already promised to comply. But the ice-cream pledge made Kennedy especially
happy because, he said, ice-cream is his favorite food.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
