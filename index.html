A Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp
that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all
mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the
Russian government said on Thursday.

The decision to promote Max comes as Moscow, locked in a standoff with the
west over Ukraine, is seeking greater control over the internet. The Kremlin
said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government
services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”,
including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm
behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts

the 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 with lowest median worker pay – dubbed the
Low-Wage 100 by the Institute for Policy Studies – widened by 12.9% between
2019 and 2024, from 560 to 1 to 632 to 1.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
