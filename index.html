Wang Jin felt sure that he could invest in Sichuan Trust, an institution that

his real name) recalls.

Unluckily for him, in May 2020, the company said that it would be unable to
repay 20bn yuan of investments. Protests ensued, with hundreds of middle-aged
investors gathering outside the headquarters in Chengdu to demand their money
back. By the end of the year, the local government had taken over the firm,
which was reported to have a shortfall of more than 30bn yuan on its books,
although the company said the sum was closer to 25bn.

Central Park, Donald Trump has stamped his name in golden letters on
skyscrapers across New York City.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI has completed a deal that values the artificial

citing multiple people with knowledge of the deal.

The company would sell existing shares in a so-called tender offer led by

“Rome is now the city of luxury hotels,” said Giuseppe Botrugno as he served

the humble bar and eatery for affordable, no-nonsense Roman fare.

“There is one opposite, one around the corner, and another planned next door
to that one,” added Botrugno, who along with his brother has run Bar San
Marcello on Via di San Marcello, a narrow street close to the Trevi fountain,

            <p>While the Red Sea resort of Dahab draws those who earn dollars and can work
anywhere, a third of Egyptians live in poverty and see a perilous voyage to
Europe as their only hope

Bordered by the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, Egypt is a country blessed with
many miles of coastline, and its resorts have long been tourist favourites.
But in a country in which the divide between rich and poor has always been
stark, Egypt’s recent economic woes have had a seismic effect on society – and
nowhere illustrates that better than the fortunes of those making their way to
the country’s two coasts.

Along the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba, the once-quiet fishing outpost of Dahab has
become a haven for well-off young digital nomads. Its warm turquoise waters

as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing

I run a small business. My company sells customer relationship management
(CRM) software to other businesses. I’m always in search of leads and will try
just about anything to find new clients that we can help. To that end, I
recently wrote a book about CRM and created a landing page on my website where
people – clients and prospects – can download it. How to promote my new book?
Why not X?

I know the X community – and its famous CEO – may not be everyone’s cup of
tea. But I’ve been a longtime active user and I’m sure there are many other
Xers who would enjoy reading my book. So I decided to conduct an experiment
and create a post with a link to my book’s landing page and promote it on the
social platform. Not a big promotion. Just 50 bucks over five days. A

Plastic producers have known for more than 30 years that recycling is not an

has not stopped them from promoting it, according to a new report.

“The companies lied,” said Richard Wiles, president of fossil-fuel

they’ve caused.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
