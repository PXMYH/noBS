            <p>Watchdogs could cut capital rules as Trump’s deregulation drive opens door to
rollback of post-crisis protections

  * Business live – latest updates

US watchdogs are reportedly planning to slash capital rules for banks designed
to prevent another 2008-style crash, as Donald Trump’s deregulation drive
opens the door to the biggest rollback of post-crisis protections in more than
a decade.

The move follows heavy lobbying by the banking industry, with lenders such as
JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs having long complained that competition and
lending have been hindered by burdensome rules governing the assets they must
hold versus their liabilities.

Americans overseas to projects in emerging economies, Anderson had expected to
spend her whole career in international development.

“I had taken this job two years ago expecting to stay here for at least 10
years, and you know, we had started to make a community and build up our life
here. In January, we had started looking at buying a home,” she says.

            <p>As many films struggle to find distribution, Watermelon Pictures has stepped
in to help tell stories from Palestine and other marginalized communities

In March, The Encampments, a documentary on the pro-Palestinian protest
movement on US college campuses, opened at the Angelika Film Center in New
York. The nonfiction theatrical marketplace has never been breezy in the US,
but this is a particularly difficult time for documentaries, let alone films
about hot-button issues considered politically sensitive or, under the new
administration, outright dangerous; one of the Encampments’ primary subjects,
the Columbia University student-activist Mahmoud Khalil, remains in detention
by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) without charge for any crime.
Large-scale distributors, including all of the major streaming services, are
increasingly wary of anything deemed controversial, leaving such films as
Union, on the Amazon Labor Union, or the Oscar-winning Palestinian-Israeli
documentary No Other Land without distribution in the US.

Nevertheless, over an exclusive first-weekend run, The Encampments made
$80,000 at the Angelika – the highest per-screen average for a documentary
since the Oscar-winning Free Solo in 2018. That number may sound like peanuts
compared with, say, the multimillion theatrical haul of a Marvel movie, but
it’s a significant win for the specialty box office – and validation for a
film whose mere existence, as a pro-Palestinian narrative, led to threats of
violence at the Angelika, an incident of vandalism in the theater’s lobby and
social media censorship of its ads.

15% since this year’s start

Executives at Warner Bros Discovery, the vast media conglomerate, had a bright
idea to turbocharge the growth of its streaming service in 2023: rebrand its
famous streaming service HBO, home to everything from The Sopranos and Game of
Thrones to The Last of Us, from HBO Max to Max.

The move was made because HBO was not the sort of place “parents would most
eagerly drop off their kids”, said the head of streaming, JB Perrette. Fast
forward two years, and on Wednesday, executives at the same company unveiled a
new bright idea: re-rebrand the service from Max to HBO Max.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Thanks to poor engineering and Elon Musk, Tesla’s road rage-inducing street
tank can’t even win over its core demographic: doomsday preppers

The Cybertruck answers a question no one in the auto industry even thought to
ask: what if there was a truck that a Chechen warlord couldn’t possibly pass
up – a bulletproof, bioweapons-resistant, road rage-inducing street tank
that’s illegal to drive in most of the world?

Few had seen anything quite like the Cybertruck when it was unveiled in 2019.
Wrapped in an “ultra-hard, 30X, cold-rolled stainless steel exoskeleton”, the
Cybertruck was touted as the ultimate doomsday chariot – a virtually
indestructible, obtuse-angled, electrically powered behemoth that can repel
handgun fire and outrun a Porsche while _towing _a Porsche, with enough juice
leftover to power your house in the event of a blackout. At the launch,
Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, said the truck could tackle any terrain on Earth __
and possibly also on Mars – and all for the low, low base price of $40,000.
“Sometimes you get these late-civilization vibes [that the] apocalypse could
come along at any moment,” Musk said. “Here at Tesla, we have the best in
apocalypse technology.”

            <p>Kroger stores in multiple states have overcharged customers by listing expired
sale tags and then ringing up regular prices – a practice that adds extra
burdens on struggling US families

Derek and Allison Hadfield became more and more fed up whenever they shopped
for their family of four at their local Kroger grocery in Belpre, Ohio, a town
of about 6,600 across the Ohio River from West Virginia.

When they tried to save money by buying items on sale, they said, many of the
discounts vanished when Kroger rang up their carts at checkout. Personal
pizzas posted as on sale for $1 a piece rang up for $1.25 each. An 8oz jar of
minced garlic listed at the low price of $2.49 cost $3.99 at checkout – a 60%
jump.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
