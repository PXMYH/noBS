The former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is making a claim of “conspiracy”
against the government of Jersey after the crown dependency launched a
criminal investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering in
connection with the original source of the oligarch’s wealth.

The latest move threatens to throw open parts of a secretive legal battle on
the Channel island about the tycoon’s rise to become one of the world’s
richest people, which emerged in September after a Switzerland federal
criminal court ordered the release of a cache of Swiss banking records
requested by the Jersey attorney general.

Want to buy a new shirt from your friendly neighborhood small business? In
some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because
you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have
cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a
soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a
minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry.

I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who
carries cash anymore? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose
to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over
something that’s clearly a thing of the past?

to US shores. But is it really feasible?

Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, returned from South Carolina last
week brandishing a small piece of metal, proclaiming that it was the first
rare-earth magnet made in the US in a quarter of a century.

It was, he indicated to Fox Business, proof that the US is ending “China’s
chokehold on our supply chain”. Thanks to the South Carolina company eVAC’s
new rare-earth mineral processing center, Bessent added: “We’re finally
becoming independent again.”

Fears that it would take weeks or even months for flight schedules in the US
to return to normal in the wake of the US federal government shutdown do not
appear to be coming true and the busy upcoming holiday season should be normal
for travel, experts say.

That is at least in part because air traffic controllers are quickly returning
to work, according to the Department of Transportation.

            <p>Trump’s team flirts with weakening the dollar, threatening US influence, low
borrowing costs and global stability

Magical thinking is indispensable to understanding Team Trump’s economic
policymaking. The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can
work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.

A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar
policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they
want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.

For all the headlines about an on-off relationship with Donald Trump, baiting

Musk.

Investors in the electric vehicle maker voted on Thursday to put the world’s
richest person on the path to become the world’s first trillionaire, despite
the controversy that is now seemingly intrinsic to his public profile.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
