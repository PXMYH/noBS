Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto fraud trial neared its end with closing arguments
on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court following weeks of testimony that
lifted the veil of FTX’s stunning collapse – and a broader murkiness
surrounding digital currency markets. The prosecution quickly painted Sam
Bankman-Fried as an unabashed scammer rather than the image of the wayward
math nerd proffered by the defense throughout the trial, saying he created a
“pyramid of deceit” with his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX.

Assistant US attorney Nicholas Roos also used Bankman-Fried’s own testimony
against him.

Nearly a month after the start of his fraud trial, Sam Bankman-Fried, the one-
time cryptocurrency mogul, took the witness stand in his own defense in a
risky move that exposed him to prosecutors’ probing.

Bankman-Fried, the founder of crypto exchange FTX, spent three days answering
questions before a jury, in an 11th-hour attempt to counter the damning,
detailed testimony against him from members of his inner circle.

Thousands of workers at Britain’s biggest steelworks in Port Talbot have been
left in limbo after the plant’s owner delayed an announcement on job cuts that
was expected to cause as many as 3,000 posts to be lost from the UK workforce.

The Welsh town, which grew up around the steelworks, had been braced for
confirmation of the closures of the two blast furnaces after a meeting of the
Tata Steel board on Wednesday, in what would have marked the beginning of a
major retrenchment in UK steelmaking.

WeWork plans to file for bankruptcy as early as next week, a source familiar
with the matter said on Tuesday, as the SoftBank Group-backed company
struggles with a massive debt pile and hefty losses.

Shares of the flexible workspace provider fell 32% in extended trading after
the Wall Street Journal first reported the news. They have fallen roughly 96%
this year. The company never seemed to recover from the scandal of its
founder’s ouster and the remote work revolution of the pandemic.

The United Auto Workers has scored a major victory. It’s still awaiting a vote
by union members, but it’s a big deal – a 25% wage increase over the four and
a half years of the contract, cost-of-living increases that will further
ratchet up hourly pay, the right to strike over plant closures and a shorter
time period for workers to reach top pay.

If the victory ripples across the auto industry and encourages wage increases
in other sectors, it will also be a victory for the American middle class.

the University of California at Berkeley

In September, a “bespoke AI nutrition” store opened in beleaguered downtown
San Francisco to much fanfare, promising smoothie concoctions generated by AI
and a much-needed boost to the area. Less than two months later, it has
seemingly closed without explanation.

BetterBlends advertised “Your Smoothie, powered by AI” and received positive
press upon its opening, ginning up excitement for a new business and a novel
use of artificial intelligence. Its AI model would take customer orders and
preferences to generate a smoothie recipe that would then be blended by hand
by co-founders Michael Parlato and Clayton Reynolds, who worked in the shop.

The CEOs of the top 100 companies paying the lowest wages made an average of
$601 for every $1 earned by the average worker last year as executive
compensation continued to climb to record highs.

A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies singles out which 100
companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay their workers the least, companies the report
dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in
2022, while their CEOs took home an average $15.3m.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
