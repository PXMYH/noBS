            <p>In an unprecedented deal, a private company purchased land in a tiny Arizona

fear the agreement has ‘opened Pandora’s box’

One of the biggest battles over Colorado River water is being staged in one of
the west’s smallest rural enclaves.

Tucked into the bends of the lower Colorado River, Cibola, Arizona, is a
community of about 200 people. Maybe 300, if you count the weekenders who come
to boat and hunt. Dusty shrublands run into sleepy residential streets, which
run into neat fields of cotton and alfalfa.

Fine. But for me it’s performance that counts

Cannabis. Caffeine. Adderall. Xanax. Ritalin. Vicodin. Tito’s and Jameson.
These are all legal substances in most states. Some can only be used when
medically prescribed. The others are used “recreationally” and more people are
using them than ever before. I know this because I know many of these people.
They’re friends, workmates and even family. I’m one of those people. Do I
care? Not one bit. We’re all grownups, right?

As an employer, though, maybe I should care when my employees are doing this
on the job. It’s no surprise that the use of substances while at work is on
the rise. A recent piece by Ella Glover in Dazed cites a survey from the
American addiction site DrugAbuse.com which found that 22.5% of people admit
to consuming drugs or alcohol at work, with one in five using cannabis while
on the job. Glover points to the rise of remote work as the culprit.

From Amazon and UPS to Starbucks and Hollywood studios, organized labor is

knows why: “Workers have realized they’ve been getting screwed for decades,
and they’re fed up.”

The United Auto Workers (UAW) president has emerged at the front of the pack
of a new generation of labor leaders as a galvanizing voice in a critical year
for the labor movement and American politics.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
