Three Black men have filed a federal lawsuit against American Airlines for

plane after a complaint that an unidentified passenger had body odor.

On Wednesday, lawyers of Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph and Xavier Veal

London’s Evening Standard has announced plans to shut its daily newspaper and
replace it with a weekly outlet, bringing an end to almost 200 years of
publication in the capital.

to attendees about “brand-building, maintaining a strong company culture and
scaling operations”, per Variety. (Something she knows a lot about: Disney’s
CEO, Bob Iger, who also spoke at the summit, is an investor and board member
of the platform.)

            <p>And almost half of respondents back the filing of criminal charges against oil
companies that have contributed to the climate crisis

As US communities take big oil to court for allegedly deceiving the public
about the climate crisis, polling shared with the Guardian shows that a
majority of voters support the litigation, while almost half would back an
even more aggressive legal strategy of filing criminal charges.

The poll, which comes as the world’s first-ever criminal climate lawsuit was
brought in France last week, could shed light on how, if filed, similar US
cases might be viewed by a jury.

A London-based billionaire non-dom left the UK for good on the day that the
chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced the scrapping of the 225-year-old tax
scheme in the spring budget, his tax adviser has revealed.

“We did have one billionaire client who literally on the day of the budget, 6
March, got on his private jet with his wife, with his children, with the
private tutor, and flew to one of his other 17 houses in the world – and said
‘I’m not coming back’,” said John Barnett, a partner at the law firm Burges
Salmon, which specialises in advising the super-rich on how to legally reduce
their tax bills.

improve living conditions and fight rent increases

On a recent Friday night in San Jose, California, a small group of Spanish-
speaking renters sat in the clubhouse of their apartment complex wondering
whether the room was bugged. “Let them listen,” said a young man, with a
dismissive gesture.

They were meeting to strategize about forming a tenants’ association to

            <p>**Exclusive:** Correspondence from pilots seen by Guardian Australia pleads
for changes to the roster system to address fatigue

Senior pilots at Virgin Australia have alleged fatigue is widespread in their
ranks and raised safety concerns about a roster system some claim is working
them “to the limits”.

Guardian Australia has obtained correspondence from senior pilots pleading for
action to address worker fatigue as Virgin Australia and the Transport Workers
Union (TWU) remain in a standoff over a proposal to strip pilots of six days’
annual leave during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement.

Multiple senior pilots say the rostering system used by Virgin is adding to
fatigue levels.

The system routinely schedules pilots to work maximum shift lengths – 11-12
hours and longer in the event of delays – on back-to-back days, while allowing
for just the legal minimum rest period of 12 hours.

Pilots have raised concerns with management about the roster software and
claim that the private equity owners of the airline, Bain Capital, have not
followed through on a promise to replace it.

Frustration at what they claim is management’s failure to recognise these
issues, or respond to staff warning of a resulting “clear, present and
increasing safety risk”.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
