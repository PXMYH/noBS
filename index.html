The consumer advocate Choice also claimed, in a survey of about 9,000

delayed in the 12 months between October 2022 and this year.

one emerged victorious, the other was found at fault on 11 claims

Late on Monday afternoon, nine jurors huddled together in a San Francisco

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Lauren Danson Purvis’s company, Mizuba, has had a successful 10-year run.
Experts advise how she can keep it going while having a baby

Lauren Danson Purvis was fresh out of college when she launched Mizuba Tea Co,
her business that imports and sells fine matcha tea from Uji, Japan. A
lifelong tea nerd, Purvis had befriended a tea farmer on a family trip to the
region, which is near Kyoto and is the birthplace of matcha, a stone-milled
jade-colored green tea used in Japanese tea ceremonies. Six months later, when
the farmer she’d become friends with asked for help selling his tea in the US,
Purvis decided to start a business. But she quickly realized how little she
knew about business in general, let alone how to import tea, meet Food and
Drug Administration regulations, and create sell sheets for retailers. “I
never cried so much as I did that first year,” Purvis, 33, says. “The sheer
learning curve was extremely overwhelming. I had no idea what this entailed,
but I knew I loved matcha enough to want to see it happen.”

Her father, a family doctor who ran a practice in the Santa Barbara area for
30 years, shared advice on hiring and setting up her business, and staked
Mizuba with a small loan. Purvis repaid him the first year, and has been
profitable ever since. Her mom came onboard – now known as “the matcha mom” in
the region around the family home – and handles deliveries, receives shipments
and watches inventory. Purvis’s father joined as the CFO, and is in charge of
payroll and financial matters. Her husband, Dan, is a graphic designer who
started out working on packaging. In 2018 he came onboard full-time as the COO
and food safety manager – as well as the company’s janitor.

            <p>High-income Americans also almost as likely to defer healthcare over cost as
people with low or average incomes in other countries

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
