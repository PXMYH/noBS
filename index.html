            <p>President Donald Trump called on China to reach out to him in order to kick
off negotiations aimed at resolving the escalating trade fight between the
world’s two largest economies. “The ball is in China’s court. China needs to
make a deal with us. We don’t have to make a deal with them,” White House
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday, reading what she said was a
statement Trump dictated. “There’s no difference between China and any other
country except they are much larger, and China wants what we have, what every
country wants, what we have -- the American consumer -- or to put another way,
they need our money,” the statement continued. The comments are a fresh sign
the US and China continue to dig in their heels, indicating there is no end in
sight to fight that has seen both sides raise trade barriers to staggering
levels. (Source: Bloomberg)

The chip designer Nvidia has said it will build up to $500bn (£378bn) worth of

a sign of manufacturers investing in operations on American soil amid Donald
Trump’s tariffs.

The announcement comes after Trump reiterated threats on Sunday to impose
imminent tariffs on the semiconductors that Nvidia makes mostly in Taiwan, and

Paper receipts from major retailers in the US are so laden with bisphenol S
that holding one for 10 seconds can cause the skin to absorb enough of the

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
