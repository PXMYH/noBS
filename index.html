            <p>Kwasi Ampofo, analyst at BloombergNEF, says demand for copper is going to rise
to about 50 million tonnes from 30 million tonnes in the next 25 years, and
that miners will struggle to supply the market. Copper prices climbed to a new
record Monday, spurred by Chinese stimulus measures and US stockpiling amid
tight global supply. Ampofo speaks on Bloomberg Television.

The distress call went out to the Canadian coast guard station after midnight
on an October night. The Nathan E Stewart, an American-flagged tugboat,
sailing through the light winds and rain of the central British Columbia
coast, had grounded on a reef.

The captain tried to reverse, moving the rudder from hard over port to hard

struck the sea bed.

with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks
while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and
reds, is reminiscent of a Wes Anderson movie set.

            <p>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal
emails later revealed company’s influence

The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology has formally retracted a
sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for
Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate
don’t cause cancer.  
  
Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a note
accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious
ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors
of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies
presented”.

The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide
Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that
Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no
cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of
endocrine systems in people or animals.

  * Business live – latest updates

Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined €120m (£105m) after it
was found in breach of new EU digital laws, in a ruling likely to put the
European Commission on a collision course with the US billionaire and
potentially Donald Trump.

The breaches, under consideration for two years, included what the EU said was

transparency of the platform’s advertising.

weigh moves from Manhattan

There is a short stretch of prime waterfront real estate in Miami that has
come to be known as Billionaire’s Beach. It contains a mix of famous old art
deco hotels such as the Delano and Raleigh, both undergoing extensive upmarket
refurbishments, and the construction of exclusive new residential tower blocks
with high-end apartments running into the tens of millions.

It is here on the sun-filled shores of South Beach, more than a thousand miles
from the chills of a Manhattan winter, where realtors and developers are
beginning to see the first shoots of what they call the “Mamdani effect”: the
predicted exodus of wealthy New Yorkers in the wake of democratic socialist
Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor.

On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield
walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a
scanner gun and a laptop.

Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut
growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their
shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as
item after item rang up at a higher price.

YouTube will comply with the federal government’s under-16s social media ban,

online” and “fundamentally misunderstands” how children use the internet.

But the communications minister, Anika Wells, said YouTube had a

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
