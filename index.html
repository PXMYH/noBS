Portugal is proposing a novel way of stemming the country’s brain drain: a
decade of progressive tax breaks for young people including paying nothing at
all in their first year of work.

The centre-right minority government of Luís Montenegro is ditching a proposed
15% cap on income tax for 18- to 35-year-olds and replacing it with a
progressive scheme similar to one supported by the opposition Socialists.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In the early days of Kamp Studios, Kim Collins and Amy Morgenstern were barely
making rent. Now they’re a favorite of interior designers across the country

If there was a low point in the history of Kamp Studios, it had to have been
the day in 2010 when Kim Collins and Amy Morgenstern found themselves lugging
every single quarter, dime, nickel and penny they had scrounged up from their
apartment to pour into a coin-counting machine at a Brooklyn branch of TD
Bank. The women, then partners in both work and life, were barely making rent
while trying to keep their plastering business afloat. “We were practically
the only customers in the bank and that machine was very, very loud,” Collins
says. “It was mortifying.” They used the $117 they collected that day to buy
groceries.

Plasterwork is famously labor-intensive, messy and physically demanding – but
these weren’t the only factors that made getting a foothold in the
homebuilding space challenging for Collins and Morgenstern. According to a
2024 survey by the construction workforce management platform Lumber, women
make up 10% of the construction industry, and only 4% of on-site workers are
women. “With the exception of the interior designer or architect, who are
sometimes women, we are usually the only women working on a job site,” says
Collins.

Even though the vast majority of US labor unions have endorsed Kamala Harris,
many union members support Donald Trump, and with the race so close, unions
have stepped up efforts to convince those workers that Trump is no friend of
unions or workers.

In Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – states that Harris badly needs to
win – union households are an important voting bloc, and unions have mobilized
thousands of members to engage in worksite conversations, door-knocking and
phone-banking to make the case that Harris is far better for workers than
Trump.

A Choice analysis of carmaker privacy policies has found some of the biggest
car sellers in Australia collect and share a range of driver data, including
in some cases video and biometric data, with third parties.

The consumer group analysed the privacy policies of Toyota, Ford, MG, Mazda,
Kia, Hyundai, Tesla, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi to determine the extent that
modern vehicles are collecting data on their customers, as vehicles become
more and more digital.

Tesla’s Cybertruck is too big and sharp for European roads, transport
campaigners have warned, as questions are raised about the registration of one
of the first of the electric pickup trucks to hit the continent.

There had been confusion about whether the Cybertruck could be driven in
Europe, owing to strict road safety rules that ban sharp edges and require
speed limiters on vehicles that weigh more than 3.5 tonnes when full. Tesla’s
manual lists the angular steel vehicle as having a gross vehicle weight of 4
tonnes. (The equivalent of a standard family car, such as a Ford Focus, is 1.9
tonnes.)

College athletes are facing “significant abuse” amid a surge in harassment
unleashed by America’s gambling boom, according to US sports officials who say
students are increasingly subject to death threats, harassment and demands for
money.

A handful of state regulators have moved to ban legal gambling platforms from
offering certain types of bets on collegiate sports as a result of the
“inherently problematic” surge in harassment of college athletes online, at
venues and in dorms.

It’s 105F (41C) in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, about 20 miles away from
the bustle of tourists on the Vegas strip. Front yards have small pebbles
instead of grass, and signs that welcome the start of autumn seem premature in
the sweltering heat.

Andrew Clarke knocks on the door of a ranch-style house. A dog barks
aggressively from inside. “Hi, my name’s Andrew. I’m an organizer with For Our
Future Nevada. Is Jennifer available?” Clarke asks in an upbeat voice. The
voice says Jennifer doesn’t live there any more.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
