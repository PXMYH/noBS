            <p>Case to determine if White House violated free speech protections when it
asked social networks to remove Covid misinformation

The supreme court will hear oral arguments on Monday in Murthy v Missouri, a
case with the potential to radically redefine how the US government interacts
with social media companies. The suit is the culmination of years of a
Republican-backed legal campaign arguing that efforts by federal agencies and
Joe Biden’s White House to reduce misinformation online constitute censorship.

Central to the case is whether the White House violated free speech
protections during the Covid-19 pandemic, when government officials requested
that Twitter, Facebook and other social networks remove misinformation about
the coronavirus. The lawsuit accuses the government of “coercing” tech
platforms to change their policies, block content and suspend users. The
complaint was filed by attorneys general in Louisiana and Missouri as well as
rightwing individuals such as the conspiracy theory site founder Jim Hoft. If
the courts decide in their favor, the White House would be blocked from
contacting social media companies, as happened when a lower court sided with
the plaintiffs.

Lithium-ion batteries sparked four fires in just one day in New South Wales
this week, amid growing concern over the rise in battery-related blazes.

One man was taken to hospital and a 10-storey apartment block was evacuated
after an ebike battery exploded in Bankstown in Sydney’s south-west on
Thursday, while firefighters also responded to blazes set off by an electric
vehicle charging station in Berkeley, a garden hedger in Lake Macquarie, and a
loose battery in a garbage truck passing through Silverwater.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Carbon schemes are touted as a way to transfer billions in climate finance to
the developing world – but people at the Kariba project in Zimbabwe say most
of the profits never arrive

In the districts surrounding Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, most people have little
idea their villages were at the centre of a multimillion-dollar carbon boom.
Punctuated by straw-thatched mud houses, the Miombo woodlands on the edge of
the enormous artificial lake are mostly home to smallholder farmers. The
gravel roads are full of potholes; cars are infrequent, as are medical
facilities and internet connections. Data on the region is patchy, but
Hurungwe district, that covers a number of the villages has an average poverty
rate of 88%.

These communities fall within the vast, lucrative Kariba conservation project,
encompassing an area almost the size of Puerto Rico. It is among the largest
in a portfolio of forest offsetting schemes approved by Verra, the world’s
largest certifier. Since 2011, this project alone has generated revenue of
more than €100m (£85m) from selling carbon credits equivalent to Kenya’s 2022
national emissions to western companies, according to now-deleted figures
published by the project developer. Proponents say these schemes are a quick
way of transferring billions of dollars of climate and biodiversity finance to
the developing world through company net zero pledges.

Labor groups and government officials are pushing to rein in rampant abuses of

be currently trapped in forced labor on remote fishing vessels around the
world, according to the International Labour Organization.

Top bosses at some of America’s largest companies have received more in pay

            <p>High prices, mega mergers and union busting are just water under the bridge
judging from the scramble for a new bag

What’s so special about Trader Joe’s new mini totes? Aesthetics-wise, nothing:
the canvas bag resembles LL Bean’s ubiquitous totes. The only difference is
that these come stamped with the name of a supermarket chain known for its

enthusiasm that Trader Joe’s lawyers reportedly reserve for union busting.
Young women on TikTok have taken to decorating their mini Trader Joe’s totes

some pop stars driving around in a jerry-built Fiat Panda

I’m kneeling on the snow outside the king’s house, impersonating a 1980s

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,

            <p>Some say Biden’s high-profile warrior – who’s gone after Kroger, Amazon, and
Nvidia – has redefined the US antitrust landscape

Across 96 pages of the Yale Law Journal in 2017, Lina Khan set out why she
believed the US’s policing of big business was failing. The paper – which
targeted Amazon – shook the Silicon Valley establishment and catapulted Khan
into the heart of a battle over America’s business orthodoxy and, ultimately,
into a role in which she could overhaul it.

Khan’s appointment to lead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) just four years
later angered big tech, but it has become increasingly clear that Khan, and
the Biden administration have an even bigger agenda: resetting the federal

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
