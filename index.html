            <p>Michael Schuls died after getting trapped in dangerous machinery at a mill in
Wisconsin. But across the US conservative groups are pushing to loosen laws
that protect children in the workplace

In late June, Jim Schuls and his 16-year-old son, Michael, woke up at 4am for
their usual drive from their apartment in Florence, Wisconsin, to begin work
at 5am at a sawmill. Father and son made this journey together five times a
week in the summer, when Michael worked longer hours than he did in term time.
His two older brothers had also worked at the same mill when they were about
his age.

Their day at Florence Hardwoods – one of the largest employers in the town
with a population of about 2,000 – began as normal. Jim operated a forklift
outside while Michael worked alone inside the mill. Jim says he never worried
because he believed “young kids were stacking lumber”, not operating dangerous
machines.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Prices are starting to level out, with some toys, electronics and apparel
cheaper than last year. Why are retailers expecting a muted shopping season?

Some good news for the holiday season: shopping for gifts this year will
probably be a bit cheaper than last year. The bad news? Consumers just aren’t
feeling the holiday cheer – and with good reason.

After over a year of high inflation, prices in the US are starting to level
out, with drops in prices of some goods. The cost of a dozen eggs went from an
average of $4.83 down to an average of $2.07 this October. Gas prices
surpassed $5 a gallon in summer 2022, and are now down to a national average
of $3.30.

X [formerly know as Twitter] has been kicked out of Australia’s voluntary
misinformation and disinformation code, after failing to respond to a
complaint about shutting down channels for users to report misinformation,
during the voice to parliament referendum.

The industry association, the Digital Industry Group (Digi), announced on
Monday that its disinformation and misinformation independent complaints
subcommittee found X had “committed a serious breach of the code and has
refused to cooperate with Digi”.

Public trust in some of the world’s most repressive governments is soaring,
according to Edelman, the world’s largest public relations firm, whose
flagship “trust barometer” has created its reputation as an authority on
global trust. For years, Edelman has reported that citizens of authoritarian
countries, including Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and
China, tend to trust their governments more than people living in democracies
do.

But Edelman has been less forthcoming about the fact that some of these same
authoritarian governments have also been its clients. Edelman’s work for one
such client – the government of the UAE – will be front and center when world
leaders convene in Dubai later this month for the UN’s Cop28 climate summit.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
