  * James Muldoon, Mark Graham and Callum Cant: ‘AI feeds off the work of human beings’

Mercy craned forward, took a deep breath and loaded another task on her
computer. One after another, disturbing images and videos appeared on her
screen. As a Meta content moderator working at an outsourced office in
Nairobi, Mercy was expected to action one “ticket” every 55 seconds during her
10-hour shift. This particular video was of a fatal car crash. Someone had
filmed the scene and uploaded it to Facebook, where it had been flagged by a
user. Mercy’s job was to determine whether it had breached any of the
company’s guidelines that prohibit particularly violent or graphic content.
She looked closer at the video as the person filming zoomed in on the crash.
She began to recognise one of the faces on the screen just before it snapped
into focus: the victim was her grandfather.

Mercy pushed her chair back and ran towards the exit, past rows of colleagues
who looked on in concern. She was crying. Outside, she started calling
relatives. There was disbelief – nobody else had heard the news yet. Her
supervisor came out to comfort her, but also to remind her that she would need
to return to her desk if she wanted to make her targets for the day. She could
have a day off tomorrow in light of the incident – but given that she was
already at work, he pointed out, she may as well finish her shift.

The opening scene of the popular F/X drama The Bear’s latest season opens with
troubled chef Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto gazing at a deep scar in his hand. He
vaguely explains its origin to his doctor girlfriend, Claire; the now-healed
injury seems like nothing much to him. Attuned to what Carmy leaves unsaid,
she asks if the wound hurt so much that he couldn’t feel it at the time.

China has ramped up its anti-dumping investigation into European brandy
imports in what appears to be a retaliatory move as the EU imposed higher
tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles from Friday.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
