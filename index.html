            <p>Reduced European subsidies, a US shift to lower-priced hybrids and Chinese

The company failed to meet quarterly delivery targets multiple times in 2024.

Deliveries for 2024 were 1.79m, 1.1% lower than a year ago, below estimates of

the October-December period.

In the summer of 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic upended economies around the

after a weeping, barren woman who fell in the water hundreds of years ago,
conferring on it powers of fertility.

This belief in the divine is evident in the foothills, where a huge boulder is
emblazoned with the words, written in golden letters: “Here we come: African
Jerusalem.”

            <p>Planes were going to drop out of the sky, nuclear reactors would explode. But
then … nothing. What really happened with Y2K? People still disagree …

Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, 25 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II
stepped off a private barge to arrive at London’s Millennium Dome for its
grand opening ceremony. Dressed in a pumpkin-orange coat, she entered the
venue with Prince Philip, taking her place alongside Tony and Cherie Blair and
12,000 guests to celebrate the dawn of a new millennium. At the stroke of
midnight, Big Ben began to chime and 40 tonnes of fireworks were launched from
16 barges lined along the river. The crowd joined hands, preparing to sing
Auld Lang Syne. For a few long moments, the Queen was neglected – she flapped
her arms out like a toddler wanting to be lifted up, before Blair and Philip
noticed her, took a hand each, and the singing began. A new century was born.

One politician who wasn’t in attendance at the glitzy celebration was Paddy
Tipping, a Labour MP who spent the night in the Cabinet Office. Tipping was
minister for the millennium bug. After 25 years, it might be hard to recall
just how big a deal the bug – now more commonly called Y2K – felt then. But
for the last few years of the 90s, the idea that computers would fail
catastrophically as the clock ticked over into the year 2000 was near the top
of the political agenda in the UK and the US. Here was a hi-tech threat people
feared might topple social order, underlining humanity’s new dependence on
technological systems most of us did not understand. Though there are no
precise figures, it’s estimated that the cost of the global effort to prevent
Y2K exceeded £300bn (£633bn today, accounting for inflation).

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
