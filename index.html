            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Company to scrap several electric models and focus on gas and hybrid as US
president pulls support for EVs

Ford said on Monday it will take a $19.5bn writedown and is killing several
electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto
industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump
administration’s policies and weakening EV demand.

Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, said it will stop making the F-150

extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an Erev,

The US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British
tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.

The £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational
stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during

Farm worker Owen Salmon has picked apples in upstate New York for almost a
decade, some 1,500 miles (2,400km) from home. In the midst of harvest season
this year, Hurricane Melissa, a record-breaking category 5 hurricane, made
landfall in Jamaica.

“It was terrifying,” said Salmon, whose wife and two children were at home
near Black River, a town on the country’s south-western coast. “For days, I
couldn’t hear from them. When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely
gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re
alive.”

Universal basic income (UBI) is back, like a space zombie in a sci-fi movie,
resurrected from policy oblivion, hungry for policymakers’ attention: brains!

Andrew Yang, whose “Yang Gang” enthusiasm briefly shook up the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2020 promoting a “Freedom Dividend” to save workers
from automation – $1,000 a month for every American adult – is again the main
carrier of the bug: offering UBI to save the nation when robots eat all our
jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Artificial intelligence could make income inequality even worse and create a
new underclass. Governments and society must take action

Nowadays there seems to be nonstop discussion about AI, with much of the
conversation focused on whether there’s a speculative bubble or whether the
chipmaker Nvidia is really worth $5tn or whether OpenAI will beat its rivals
in developing new generations of artificial intelligence. But the vast
majority of Americans – just like the vast majority of Europeans and Asians –
couldn’t care less about those things.

Their big concern is whether AI is going to cause huge layoffs and create a
disastrous job market, especially for younger workers. Dario Amodei, CEO of
Anthropic, a leading AI company, fed those fears when he said that AI could
wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five
years and increase unemployment in the US to 10% to 20%. In October, Bernie
Sanders, the top Democrat on the Senate education and labor committee, issued
a report saying AI and automation could replace up to 97m jobs in the US over
the next decade.

The distress call went out to the Canadian coast guard station after midnight
on an October night. The Nathan E Stewart, an American-flagged tugboat,
sailing through the light winds and rain of the central British Columbia
coast, had grounded on a reef.

The captain tried to reverse, moving the rudder from hard over port to hard
over starboard. The boat pivoted but did not move, and the tug repeatedly
struck the sea bed.

coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a
small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.

The French luxury retail emporium opened its first New York outlet earlier
this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels
like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along
with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks
while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and
reds, is reminiscent of a Wes Anderson movie set.

  * Business live – latest updates

Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined €120m (£105m) after it
was found in breach of new EU digital laws, in a ruling likely to put the
European Commission on a collision course with the US billionaire and
potentially Donald Trump.

The breaches, under consideration for two years, included what the EU said was
a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of
transparency of the platform’s advertising.

  * Business live – latest updates

The EU is considering legally forcing industries to reduce purchases from
China to insulate Europe from future hostile acts, the industry commissioner,
Stéphane Séjourné, says.

He made his remarks as the European Commission unveiled a €3bn (£2.63bn)
strategy to reduce its dependency on China for critical raw materials amid a
global scramble caused by Beijing’s “weaponisation” of supplies of everything
from chips to rare earths.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
