Sales of new Tesla cars slumped in Europe last month in the latest indication
of a potential buyer backlash over Elon Musk’s high profile and controversial
behaviour since becoming a leading figure in Donald Trump’s administration.

The Texas-based electric carmaker sold less than 16,000 vehicles across Europe

As the Trump economy continues to perform with all the robustness and

An Orthodox Jewish passenger says a United Airlines pilot forcibly removed him
from an airplane bathroom while he was experiencing constipation, exposing his
genitalia to other flyers during a flight from Tulum, Mexico, to Houston.

Yisroel Liebb, of New Jersey, described his trip through allegedly unfriendly
skies in a federal lawsuit this week against the airline and the US Department
of Homeland Security, whose officers he said boarded the plane upon landing
and took him away in handcuffs.

The chief executive of Heathrow has defended the running of the airport after
a fire at an electrical substation stopped about 1,300 planes and disrupted
the journeys of hundreds of thousands of global passengers.

It comes after Willie Walsh, the International Air Transport Association’s
director general, criticised Heathrow for the disruption, while the energy
secretary, Ed Miliband, has now ordered the National Energy System Operator to
“urgently investigate” the outage.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>International trade boomed with the city’s early adoption of technological and
economic changes, but Black neighborhoods became ‘sacrifice zones’

Oakland, California, is often treated as a city on the margins, best known for
its struggles with poverty and gun violence, as well as for its history of
radical Black activism. But a new book, The Pacific Circuit, argues that
Oakland should be viewed as one of the centers of global change in the past
century, serving both as a key node in the new global economy built around
trans-Pacific trade, and as one of the “sacrifice zones” this economy
requires.

Far from being an outlier, US journalist Alexis Madrigal argues, Oakland is in
fact an early adopter of the technological and economic changes now tearing
through cities across the US, and around the world. Oakland has long been the
canary in Silicon Valley’s coalmine of disruption, the book suggests. But its
residents don’t suffer passively: they organize and learn how to fight back.

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
