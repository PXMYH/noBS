            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

Greer will hold high-level meetings in Brussels on Monday with ministers, EU

Drop a Duralex glass and it will most likely bounce, not break. The French
company itself has tumbled several times in the past two decades and always
bounced back, but never quite as spectacularly as when, earlier this month, it
asked the public for money.

An appeal for €5m (£4.4m) of emergency funding to secure the immediate future
of the glassworks took just five hours and 40 minutes to reach its target.
Within 48 hours, the total amount pledged had topped €19m.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Critics are concerned that Daniel Suhr, the head of a conservative legal
group, may be pulling the strings behind many of the Trump FCC’s moves

In just 14 months, Daniel Suhr, the 40-year-old president of a two-person,
Chicago-based, conservative legal organization called the Center for American
Rights, has emerged as a thorn in the side of the major US broadcast news
networks at a time when they face both financial and political
vulnerabilities.

Suhr has had a key ally in Brendan Carr, who was hand-picked by Donald Trump
to serve as the chair of the powerful Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
as the Trump administration has sought new avenues to take on the mainstream
media. Carr has resuscitated several complaints that were filed by Suhr and
dismissed at the end of Joe Biden’s administration and has seemingly factored
in Suhr’s suggestions when reviewing media mergers.

            <p>This story of emancipated young women escaping draconian social strictures
brims with enthusiasm and features a cameo from Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Based on a true story, Bill Guttentag’s rousing drama attests to the
resilience of women who dare to dream despite draconian social strictures. The
film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and
businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who
assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The
young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same
zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women
are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their
quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public
scorn from conservatives.

Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which
splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-
enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.)
A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around
the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces
are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than
competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they
offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.

The former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is making a claim of “conspiracy”
against the government of Jersey after the crown dependency launched a
criminal investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering in
connection with the original source of the oligarch’s wealth.

The latest move threatens to throw open parts of a secretive legal battle on
the Channel island about the tycoon’s rise to become one of the world’s
richest people, which emerged in September after a Switzerland federal
criminal court ordered the release of a cache of Swiss banking records
requested by the Jersey attorney general.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
