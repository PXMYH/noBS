Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on the world are being scrutinized by the US
supreme court today, a crucial legal test of the president’s controversial
economic strategy – and his power.

Justices started to hear oral arguments this morning on the legality of using
emergency powers to impose tariffs on almost every US trading partner.

            <p>Deutsche Bank: Growing chorus of ‘whether we might be on verge of equity
correction;’ China ends tariffs on US imports including farm goods but soy
bean levies remain

The Financial Conduct Authority has extended its consultation on the £11bn
compensation scheme over the loan scandal, in a move that notably pushes the
deadline onto the other side of the UK’s crucial autumn budget.  
  
It comes after lenders and consumer groups said they needed more time to
analyse extensive market data, with the main consultation paper alone running
more than 300 pages long. The deadline has now been pushed from 18 November to
12 December.  
  
While an extended deadline might not sound exciting on its own, it could end
up providing a bargaining chip for banks like **Lloyds** , **Barclays** and
**Santander UK** , as the Treasury considers whether to hike taxes on the
banking sector in order to strengthen the public finances.  
  
Last week, banking analyst **John Cronin** of Seapoint Insights, wrote:

If the Treasury’s consultation in a motor finance redress scheme context is
extended, this may well give the Chancellor pause for thought before lashing
more taxes onto the sector.

Indeed, it might suit the banks for the argument to be drawn out in a bank
taxes context, because if the consultation is still open at the stage of the
Budget, Reeves will be presumably in a bind as regards what to do.

The French equalities regulator has ruled that Facebook’s algorithm for
placing job adverts is sexist, after an investigation found that adverts for
mechanic roles skewed towards men while those for preschool teachers were
targeted at women.

The Défenseur des Droits watchdog said the Facebook system for targeted job
ads treated users differently based on their sex, and constituted indirect
discrimination. The regulator recommended that Facebook and its parent
company, Meta, took measures to ensure adverts were non-discriminatory, giving
the company three months to inform the French body of the measures.

When Corinne Low gave birth to her son in 2017, everything seemed to be lining
up. A tenure-track economist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton
School, she was working in a career she had long dreamed of. Her husband,
stepchild and baby lived in New York City and the two-hour commute to
Philadelphia was inconvenient but sustainable. She was embarking on a journey
to do it all: a working mom, supporting her family with a career she loved.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
