            <p>As Tax Day approaches, accountants debunk some money-saving claims that are a

            <p>Thanks to near-monopolies in many industries, corporations are seeing record
profits as consumers struggle with high prices

We learned this week that the Consumer Price Index climbed 3.5% in March from
a year earlier, up from 3.2% in February, and faster than most economists

This poses a conundrum for central bankers who have made it clear they want to
see further evidence that inflation is cooling before they cut interest rates.

slowdown of plant closures in Europe and the US.

Occasionally Yours has long been a community meeting spot in the town of
Swarthmore. More recently, it has taken on another, unexpected, role – on the
stage of national politics.

Richardson is an independent-minded small business owner in a key swing state
– exactly the kind of person US presidential candidates are desperate to woo.
In 2016, when Pennsylvania went Republican for the first time since 1988, he
voted for Donald Trump. Then, in 2020, dismayed by Trump’s Covid response, he
switched to Joe Biden, in no uncertain terms. Richardson’s vote tracked how
the state went in both elections.

The US’s top labor lawyer has said her agency will not “succumb” to Amazon,

Jennifer Abruzzo, the NLRB general counsel, accused some of the US’s largest
corporations of “jumping on the bandwagon” in mounting legal challenges to the
labor watchdog, which has found itself at the center of the ongoing battle
between the companies and a wave of unionizing efforts by workers.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
