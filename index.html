            <p>Israel launched airstrikes across Iran on Friday morning, targeting nuclear
facilities and killing senior military commanders in a major escalation that
could spark a broad war in the Middle East. Explosions were heard across
Tehran, Natanz nd other cities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel -- which used 200 air force planes and said it hit around 100 targets
-- had “struck at the heart of Iran’s nuclear enrichment program.” The head of
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and the military’s
chief of staff, Mohammad Bagheri, were both killed, according to Iranian
media. At least two other senior IRGC members also died. The Opening Trade has

            <p>Brent surged almost 10% after Israel carried out military strikes against
Iran. Israel targeted nuclear facilities and killed senior military commanders
in a major escalation that could spark a broad war in the Middle East.
Explosions were heard across Tehran, Natanz -- home to a key atomic site --
and other cities, according to local and social media. Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel -- which used 200 air force planes and said it
hit around 100 targets -- had “struck at the heart of Iran’s nuclear
enrichment program.” Today&#39;s guests: Hugh Gimber, JPMorgan Asset Management

House, the US president disclosed the pact would also facilitate Chinese
students’ access to US colleges.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
