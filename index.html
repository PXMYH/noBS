Paper receipts from major retailers in the US are so laden with bisphenol S
that holding one for 10 seconds can cause the skin to absorb enough of the
highly toxic chemical to violate California’s safety threshold, new research
has found.

The findings are being used as evidence in legal action aimed at pressuring
retailers to stop using receipt paper treated with bisphenol S, or BPS, which
is linked to cancer and reproductive problems.

Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation 5 by 25% as the video game

price of the console’s digital edition to £429.99 in the UK and €499.99 in
Europe, starting from Monday. There will be no price change for the standard

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said that he is worried the US will experience
“something worse than a recession” as a result of Donald Trump’s trade
policies.

Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the 75-year-old hedge fund manager

The UK and its G7 allies are considering tightening the “meaningless” cap on

markets to crash.

UK Treasury officials are understood to be looking at plans to lower the $60
(£46) a barrel cap Russianexports after the oil market plunged this week to
$59.77 a barrel for the first time in more than four years.

The General Motors Flint Assembly plant is a hulking symbol of American auto
industry might, a 5m-sq-ft factory stretching as far as the eye can see down
Van Slyke Road, and it hums: three shifts almost daily crank out the Silverado
truck, the automaker’s most popular product.

The plant weathered decades of industrial disinvestment in Flint, a blue-
collar city of about 80,000 in mid-Michigan, the nation’s auto capital. Flint
Assembly remains an economic cornerstone of a Rust belt region filled with
working-class swing voters who helped propel Donald Trump to his second term.

            <p>Trump ended the ‘de-minimis’ rule while launching a trade war with China –
which will make retail giants such as Temu more expensive, experts say

After a chaotic week of flip-flopping tariff policies, cheap clothes from
China are nearly certain to face a steep price hike soon – prompting concern
among fast fashion retailers and potentially pushing consumers to look for
other alternatives.

As part of a package of global tariff policies announced on “liberation day”
last week, Donald Trump signed an executive order that ended a duty-free
exemption for low-priced goods to enter the US from China and Hong Kong. Known
as the “de-minimis” rule, packages under $800 do not qualify for any taxes or
tariffs on the goods and are inspected minimally at the border.

websites and deleting sections entirely related to DEI. In some cases, firms

            <p>Sell-off comes amid anger from Democrats over retreat that rattled markets,
while Republicans praise Trump’s ‘art of the deal’ in action

US stocks fell again on Thursday after a historic rally following Donald
Trump’s shock retreat on Wednesday on the hefty tariffs he had just imposed on
dozens of countries.

The falls came as the president blamed “transition problems” for the market
reaction and the sell-off deepened after a White House clarification noted
that total tariffs on China had been raised by 145% since Trump took office.

            <p>As China retaliates against tariffs, it is also making strategic manoeuvres on
EU and Asia to maximise opportunities

On the basis of Napoleon’s dictum “never interrupt your enemy while they are
making a mistake”, there was a large incentive for China to do precisely
nothing as Donald Trump displayed his determination to lose friends and induce
market panic. Indeed, the Chinese advocates of passivity cited a social media
meme attributed to President Xi Jinping: “Do nothing. Win.”

she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol

husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
