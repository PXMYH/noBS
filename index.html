  * Business live – latest updates

The EU is considering legally forcing industries to reduce purchases from
China to insulate Europe from future hostile acts, the industry commissioner,
Stéphane Séjourné, says.

He made his remarks as the European Commission unveiled a €3bn (£2.63bn)
strategy to reduce its dependency on China for critical raw materials amid a
global scramble caused by Beijing’s “weaponisation” of supplies of everything
from chips to rare earths.

YouTube will comply with the federal government’s under-16s social media ban,
but its parent company Google has warned the laws “won’t keep teens safer
online” and “fundamentally misunderstands” how children use the internet.

But the communications minister, Anika Wells, said YouTube had a
responsibility to keep its platform safe, calling its warnings “outright
weird”.

            <p>Four years after workers at a Starbucks store in upstate New York became the
first to unionize, hundreds of outlets followed – defying intense resistance
from the coffee chain. What happened next?

Thousands of Starbucks baristas are on strike across the US, warning the
world’s largest coffee chain to brace for the “longest and biggest” bout of
industrial action in its history.

Barely a year after Brian Niccol, the Starbucks CEO, tried to draw a line
under bitter divisions between its management and unionized workers, pledging
to “engage constructively” with them, the American coffee giant is now
grappling with an escalating strike during its lucrative holiday trading
season.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
