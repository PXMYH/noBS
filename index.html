A group of the world’s top economists – including the Nobel prize winner

it tackles the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

More than 600 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed
across the island, in what Sri Lanka’s president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake,
called the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”.

            <p>As Congress cuts healthcare access to pay for tax cuts and poor Americans die
earlier, billionaires invest in anti-ageing

There’s a weird disconnect to the public debate about health in the United
States. In January, millions of Americans may drop their health insurance as
premiums skyrocket following the Trump administration’s decision to end
federal subsidies that helped some 20 million people afford insurance on the
Obamacare marketplaces.

Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress agreed to cut more than $850bn from
the 10-year budgets of Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income
people, and the Chip health insurance program for children, in order to pay
for some tax cuts. Given the US’s budgetary rules, that cut means an
additional $500bn in funding for Medicare is at risk.

After several failed attempts at elected office, Dan Bongino finally found
national acclaim as a pugilistic, bare-knuckle conservative media personality,
appearing as a contributor on Fox News before hosting an eponymous radio show
and podcast.

The Dan Bongino Show, which was hosted by Westwood One, ended abruptly earlier
this year when Bongino was plucked out of the conservative media-sphere by
another veteran pro-Maga podcaster, Kash Patel, and picked to serve as his
second-in-command at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

On a cold January day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, workers at a Whole Foods
Market store in the heart of the city made history. Organizers won a vote to
form a union for the very first time in one of the grocery chain’s 530 US

Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, which has spent years quashing unionization

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
