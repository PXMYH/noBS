  * China and Canada retaliate after Trump trade tariffs come into effect

 **The US dollar is weakening today, amid growing concerns that Donald Trump’s
policies could push America’s economy into a contraction, and possibly a full-
blown recession.**

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of rival
currencies, has dropped by 0.44% today, as traders anticipate that a trade war
will drive up US inflation and hurt its economy.

Wall Street tumbled off the back of the news, while the US Dollar declined as
market participants began to contemplate the risks of a US recession. While
much of the change is due to mechanical factors in the way GDP is calculated,
a deepening trade deficit along with signs of weaker consumer spending and
business activity has driven the Atlanta Fed’s GDP Nowcast to -2.8%.

Subsequently, the markets have shifted forward expectations of the next Fed
rate cut to June, with May increasingly looking like a “live” meeting.

Already queasy from a fading AI-driven rally, Wall Street is now staring down
a worsening cocktail of Trump’s tariff fury, stretched equity valuations, and
the cold, hard realization that the U.S. economy may be losing steam.
Meanwhile, across the pond, Europe—long the ugly duckling of global markets—is
suddenly the belle of the ball.

While America grapples with an economic hangover, European stocks are ripping
higher, fueled by a mix of bargain-hunting, fiscal policy shifts, and the
tantalizing prospect of a peace deal in Ukraine. The euro and bond yields are
climbing, while the dollar and Treasuries slump—proof that global capital is
rebalancing. Defence and infrastructure spending is setting the tone for a
European revival, while Washington is left debating whether it’s about to
stumble into a self-inflicted “Trumpcession.”

Following the 0.5% m/m slump in real consumption in January and the massive
10% m/m surge in real goods imports, we now expect first-quarter GDP to
_contract_ by 1.0% annualised. Assuming that surge in imports reflects the
front-running of tariffs, however, it should be more than reversed in the
second quarter, when we expect GDP to rebound by 4.5% annualised.

The upshot is that a “Trumpcession” should be avoided and there is no need for
the Fed to cut interest rates.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>US President Donald Trump delivered on his threat to hit Canada and Mexico
with sweeping import levies and doubled an existing charge on China, spurring
swift reprisals that plunged the world economy into a deepening trade war. On
Tuesday, for the second time in a month, China announced tariffs as high as
15% on US agricultural goods and banned trade with some defense companies. The
Canadian government also announced a sweeping package of counter-tariffs
against US-made products. Meanwhile the European Union will propose extending
€150 billion in loans to boost defense spending as the bloc tries to adjust to
President Trump’s abrupt pullback of American security on the continent. Trump
has ordered a pause to all US military aid to Ukraine. Today&#39;s guests: Gregory

Thirty-six hours by boat from Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, Deodato
Alves da Silva longs for enough electricity to keep his tucumã and cupuaçu
fruits fresh. These highly nutritious Amazonian superfoods are rich in
antioxidants and vitamins, and serve as a main source of income for farmers in
Silva’s area. However, the lack of electricity to refrigerate the fruit makes
it hard to sell their produce.

Silva’s fruit-growing operation is located in the village of Boa Frente, in
Novo Aripuanã municipality, one of Brazil’s most energy-poor regions, where
there is only one diesel-powered electricity generator working for a few hours
a day.

Major egg corporations may be using avian flu as a ruse to hike up prices,
generating record profits while hurting American consumers, new research
suggests.

The cost of a dozen large eggs hit almost $5 in January – a record high in the
US and more than two and a half times the average price three years ago before
the avian flu outbreak. This signifies a 157% inflation rate for eggs – a
previously go-to affordable protein source for many American families.

the ex-banking boss lied about the depth of the two men’s relationship.

The comments were made on the first day of a legal battle in which Staley is

Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said on Sunday that government

to questions about whether the spending cuts pushed by the billionaire
businessman Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge)
could possibly cause an economic downturn.

“You know that governments historically have messed with GDP,” Lutnick said on

When Elon Musk unveiled Tesla’s “truck of the future” in 2019, Filipos could
barely contain his excitement. He quickly paid $100 to get on the waitlist.
Filipos described himself as a “true Tesla fanboy”, and the Cybertruck would
be the third vehicle he’d buy from the company.

“When the Cybertruck came out, I watched the live event that night, and my
wife was sitting there going, ‘No. No. No,’” said Filipos, who lives in a
suburb of Philadelphia and whose last name is being withheld for fear of
online retribution. Despite his wife’s disapproval, Filipos loved the bulky
trapezoidal truck. “I was truly geeking out on it,” he said.

The Trump administration recently announced that it would be laying off

people employed by the agency. Tens of thousands of federal employees at other
agencies are also losing their jobs.

The timing could not be worse. We’re in the middle of the tax season with
corporations and individuals facing filing deadlines in March and April.

will need to be answered. But that’s not all.

An Elon Musk ally installed in the US government said in a late night email

option would be shuttered – and its employees would be let go.

The 18F office within the General Services Administration (GSA) created the
IRS Direct File program that allows for free online tax filings. It has been a
frequent target of Musk, and one of the billionaire businessman’s close
associates who holds a key position in the GSA informed staffers that the
agency would close 18F in an email to staffers that arrived around 1am on
Saturday morning.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
