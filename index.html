Donald Trump proclaimed he was for “all the forgotten men and women”, in his

Vance consistently portrays himself as a pro-worker populist. But an analysis
of the labor chapter of Project 2025 – an ambitious rightwing plan to guide
the next Republican presidency – found it has little to offer them.

Project 2025’s labor section proposes hardly anything to improve workers’
wages and working conditions. It is, however, chock full of recommendations

rightwing culture war.

It’s The Dealership, a weekly TikTok series brought to you by Mohawk
Chevrolet. It’s filmed just like the popular TV show The Office. And it’s a

Berkshire sold about 390m Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115m

about 400m shares worth $84.2bn as of 30 June.

            <p>Sam Altman’s ChatGPT promises to transform the global economy. But it also
poses an enormous threat. Here, a scientist who appeared with Altman before
the US Senate on AI safety flags up the danger in AI – and in Altman himself

before he was 30. A few months before the hearing, his company’s product

prime ministers and presidents around the globe. US Senator Kyrsten Sinema
gushed: “I’ve never met anyone as smart as Sam… He’s an introvert and shy and
humble… But… very good at forming relationships with people on the Hill and…
can help folks in government understand AI.” Glowing portraits at the time
painted the youthful Altman as sincere, talented, rich and interested in
nothing more than fostering humanity. His frequent suggestions that AI could
transform the global economy had world leaders salivating.

            <p>As demand for the tin ore cassiterite soars, special forces units of Brazil’s
Ibama environment agency must play a cat and mouse game with the thousands of
illegal miners pouring into Yanomami reserves

In the back yard of the federal police headquarters in Roraima, the
northernmost state of Brazil, giant sacks lie strewn and overflowing with a
jet-black, gravel-like mineral: cassiterite. Although less high-profile than
other items seized during a crackdown on illegal mining in this Amazon state –
including a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter painted in the colours of the Brazilian
flag – cassiterite has become so sought-after that it is nicknamed “black
gold”.

Cassiterite is the chief ore of tin, a less heralded but critical mineral for
the energy transition. It is used in coatings for solar panels, lithium-ion
batteries and solder for electronics, including wind turbines, mobile phones,
computers and industrial alloys.

Shares in the company sank 19% as a string of leading technology stocks came

The Dow Jones fell nearly 500 points (1.2%), while the S&amp;P 500 was also down
1.3%. A series of disappointing results from tech companies have led to sell-

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
