US companies would no longer be able to bar employees from taking jobs with
competitors under a rule approved by a federal agency on Tuesday, though the
rule is sure to be challenged in court.

US supreme court justices on Tuesday appeared to agree with Starbucks in the
coffee chain’s challenge to a judicial order requiring it to rehire seven
employees at a Tennessee cafe who were fired as they pursued efforts to
unionize.

The justices heard arguments in the company’s appeal of a lower court’s

harder to bring a quick halt to labor practices challenged as unfair under
federal law while the NLRB resolves complaints.

The EU’s green deal to restore biodiversity, clean the continent’s soil, air

contractor that hired him provided no protection, he said – so when he
slipped, and a nail struck him just above the ankle, it became “really

Antonio was given hydrogen peroxide, and the contractor promised to get him
medical attention the next day. But after developing a fever overnight, and

billionaire who thinks he is above the law” as the rift deepens between
Australia and the tech platform over the removal of videos of a violent
stabbing in a Sydney church.

On Monday evening in an urgent last-minute federal court hearing, the court

            <p>Platform’s future in US in doubt after House approves bill ordering Bytedance
to sell stake

TikTok has said it will fight any ban or forced sale of the app’s US operation
in the courts, after the House of Representatives passed legislation targeting
the viral video platform.

The company’s future in the US was placed in further doubt over the weekend
after lawmakers in Washington passed a bill that will ban the app if TikTok’s
Chinese owner, ByteDance, does not sell its stake in the American business.

the World Bank has said.

Indermit Gill, the bank’s chief economist, said that after four years the
G20’s common framework – designed to speed up and simplify debt restructuring
– had not provided a single dollar of new money.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Retail inflation has lessened, but businesses are still swamped by huge price
increases in materials and services

Consumer prices ticked up again in March, rising to anywhere from 3.2% to 3.8%
year-over-year, depending on the rate you’re tracking. Of course, that’s way
down from what it was back in 2022. But don’t tell that to any of my clients –
or people running businesses in just about every industry across the country.
For them, prices are not only rising but are significantly – significantly! –
higher than they were when Joe Biden took office.

Want some examples?

If you’re in the manufacturing business, you’re paying 11% more for plastics
and resins, 24% more for industrial gases, 23% higher prices for machinery and
equipment, 35% additional cash for the oil and grease that lubricates those
machines, and 18% more for industrial chemicals (which get used in just about
everything) since 2021. Overall, your total costs of manufacturing are 26%
higher than they were just three years ago.

In the construction business the good news is that lumber prices have actually
fallen 25% since 2021. But that’s been more than offset by a rise in iron and
steel (27%), cement and concrete (42%), and staples, nails, spikes and tacks
(21%). Overall, construction materials costs have increased about 30% since
the last inauguration.

My clients in the food manufacturing and service industries are also feeling
the pain. Food manufacturing costs have risen 24% since 2021, the cost of
fertilizer is up 34% and animal feeds are up 10%. Now do you understand why
restaurant owners are struggling to stay in business and have resorted to
adding surcharges for credit card and other fees?

Once you make any of your products, you’ll be paying 8% more for domestic
freight and a whopping 49% more to ship or receive stuff overseas. Packaging
all your products with paperboard boxes and other components will also cost
you 38% more than it did three years ago.

Since 2021, hourly wages are up 16% and health and property insurance rates
are up 8% to 10%. And interest costs have quadrupled, with most of my clients
paying two to three points over the 8.5% prime rate.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
