            <p>President Donald Trump is extending a tariff truce with China for another 90
days, stabilizing trade ties between the world’s two largest economies. Trump
signed an order extending the truce, CNBC reported on Monday, citing a White
House official. The truce, which saw the US and China agree to reduce tit-for-
tat tariff hikes and ease export restrictions on rare earth magnets and
certain technologies, was due to expire Tuesday. Negotiators from both sides
reached a preliminary agreement to keep the arrangement last month in Sweden,
and the president’s advisers had expressed optimism he would approve it. The
White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump,
speaking to reporters earlier Monday, demurred when asked if he would extend
the deal. Senior Fellow at New York University, and Former British Trade
Official Ed Price criticized the extension on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The controversial $8bn deal was finalized this week and while details are
scarce, the future is set to look very different for one of the biggest
Hollywood studios

The merger between Paramount and Skydance has finally been completed, with
various roadblocks (including Stephen Colbert, apparently, as well as the

called Paramount, A Skydance Corporation.

It’s an appropriately franchise-y moniker for a merger between a major
Hollywood studio and a company that made its bones as a constant financer of
some of its biggest movie series. This ends (for now) years of speculation
over what might be done with Paramount, a global conglomerate that was

studios, Disney, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. (Well, maybe not the
recently embattled Warner Bros, though they seem to have gotten a major
reprieve with their killer 2025 slate) Skydance honcho David Ellison is the

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
