Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec to discuss consolidation in the gaming space,
the growth in popularity for video games and the company&#39;s acquisition of
Pokémon GO. In February, Scopely purchased the hit game Pokémon Go for $3.5
billion. Scopely’s goal, according to Co-Chief Executive Officer Javier
Ferreira, is to have a portfolio of successful titles that can support each
other in an $178 billion industry that was essentially flat last year. While
mobile games like Pokémon Go are at the core of Scopely’s business, the
company is developing or considering acquiring PC and console titles. Ferreira
said massively multiplayer online role-playing games are “interesting,”
although he declined to say if the company was making one. At Screentime, Lee
says gaming is a fast growing area for investment and investments show people
are seeing opprotunity. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>Business leaders are prioritising automation through AI to fill skills gaps,
rather than training junior employees, survey finds

Business leaders may be ‘pulling up the ladder’ behind them, by focusing on AI
tools rather than taking on new staff, warns **Kate Field,** global head human
and social sustainability at the **BSI.**

 **Field explains:**

“As roles are streamlined or eliminated before experience can be gained, we
risk eroding the professional aspirations of people at the very start of their
careers and before they’ve had the chance to flourish.

Our findings suggest a troubling trend: senior leaders may be ‘pulling up the
ladder’, prioritizing short-term productivity over long-term workforce
resilience. If left unchecked, this could have lasting consequences, from
weakening our skills pipeline, deepening generational inequality and our
research suggests, dividing large companies and SMEs.

Half (51%) of the respondents working in SMEs say AI is crucial to the growth
of their organization, compared with nearly seven in ten respondents in large
organizations (69%). This is reflected in its impact being felt; 70% of large
businesses reported AI saves money compared to just half of SMEs (51%).

Donald Trump has placed dozens of people with ties to the fossil fuel sector

oil, gas or coal companies, according to a new analysis.

The report from Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy and ethics non-profit that
has been critical of the Trump administration, alongside the Revolving Door
Project, a corporate watchdog, analyzed the backgrounds of nominees and
appointees within the White House and eight agencies dictating energy,
environmental and climate policy. That includes the Environmental Protection
Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.

A small flotilla of gaily coloured fishing boats line the shingle beach at
Hastings, East Sussex. Behind them are the bulldozers that shunt them into the
waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish
stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell
some of the day’s catch.

This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats
have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066.

in southern Italy in 1846, using the family’s three horses to lug grain from
the surrounding Campania region and Puglia to produce fresh pasta.

“Demand for premium pasta in the US has been growing,” says Rummo. Appreciated
by consumers for a traditional processing method that guarantees it will cook
to _al dente_ perfection, sales of Pasta Rummo have been thriving.

The Internal Revenue Service said it will furlough nearly half of its

In a statement on Wednesday, the IRS said that “due to the lapse in

already-identified excepted and exempt employees”.

trying to grapple with political maths

  * Macron asks outgoing French PM to make last-ditch effort to avoid political crisis

  * What happened on a chaotic day in French politics – and what next?

Sébastien Lecornu’s abrupt resignation as the French prime minister on Monday
after less than a month in the role marked the latest clash between France’s
stretched public finances and its polarised politics.

Lecornu was the latest prime minister to try and fail to cobble together a
package of spending cuts and tax rises that would pass muster in a parliament
without a clear majority, and contain mounting bond market pressures.

            <p>As the super rich grow even richer, inequality expert Chuck Collins says the
system is broken – but it can be fixed

To many Americans, the economy of the past five years has been rough. Prices
have soared yet pay remains stagnant. High mortgage rates have made buying a
home a dismal prospect. The unemployment rate has been creeping up.

Most people have indicated they are delaying major life decisions, including
having kids or switching jobs, because of the instability. But for a very
small group of people, the last five years couldn’t have been any better.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Indigenous groups in Mexico opposed to the planned brewery say families
already have little access to water – and that their way of life is also under
threat

On a summer evening in southern Mexico, a percussion group using water bottles
as instruments leads a procession through Mérida, capital of Yucatán state.
Children walking alongside elderly people are guided by members of Múuch’
Xíinbal, a Maya land rights organisation. The placards they carry declare:
“Water is not for sale.” A heavy chant accompanies the march: “It’s not a
drought – it’s plunder!”

At a rallying point in the city, protesters read from a manifesto and accuse
the government of prioritising profit over water, health and land. They
denounce a wave of mega-projects imposed without their consent, from
industrial-scale pig farms to the controversial Maya Train tourist expansion.
But they reserve their greatest anger for the Heineken brewery in Kanasín,
near Mérida, which was announced in June.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
