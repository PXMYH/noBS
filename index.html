The UK and its G7 allies are considering tightening the “meaningless” cap on

markets to crash.

UK Treasury officials are understood to be looking at plans to lower the $60

The General Motors Flint Assembly plant is a hulking symbol of American auto
industry might, a 5m-sq-ft factory stretching as far as the eye can see down
Van Slyke Road, and it hums: three shifts almost daily crank out the Silverado
truck, the automaker’s most popular product.

The plant weathered decades of industrial disinvestment in Flint, a blue-
collar city of about 80,000 in mid-Michigan, the nation’s auto capital. Flint
Assembly remains an economic cornerstone of a Rust belt region filled with
working-class swing voters who helped propel Donald Trump to his second term.

which will make retail giants such as Temu more expensive, experts say

After a chaotic week of flip-flopping tariff policies, cheap clothes from
China are nearly certain to face a steep price hike soon – prompting concern
among fast fashion retailers and potentially pushing consumers to look for
other alternatives.

As part of a package of global tariff policies announced on “liberation day”
last week, Donald Trump signed an executive order that ended a duty-free
exemption for low-priced goods to enter the US from China and Hong Kong. Known
as the “de-minimis” rule, packages under $800 do not qualify for any taxes or
tariffs on the goods and are inspected minimally at the border.

of intimidation against the legal profession.

The changes, which have occurred at some of the nation’s most prestigious
firms, include eliminating mention of pro-bono immigration work from firm
websites and deleting sections entirely related to DEI. In some cases, firms
appear to have dropped the word “diversity” from descriptions of their work.

Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk, both chefs, abandoned their purportedly eco-

The price of eggs continues to soar for American consumers, rising by almost

Breaking a record high for the third consecutive month, the average cost of a
dozen large eggs hit $6.23 in March – more than double the price just 12
months earlier, according to new figures released by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics on Thursday. This surpassed the previous record highs of $5.90 a
dozen in February, and $4.95 in January.

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
