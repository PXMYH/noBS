A 113-year-old courthouse with a towering copper dome near the banks of the
Truckee River in Reno, Nevada, was for several days last week the center of a
family drama that could in time affect the information and opinion consumption
of global millions.

What is at stake could be the fate of one of the most powerful media empires
in the world and, in the shape of Fox News in the US, one that has been a
driving force behind Donald Trump’s Maga movement just as he seeks to return
to the White House.

It has been clear for some time that Australia is unlikely to come close to
meeting the Albanese government’s goal of 1.2m new homes over the five years
from last July.

The National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, set up late in 2023,
expects “just under 1m homes” over that period – an estimate in line with
bodies such as the Housing Industry Association. Approvals barely topped
160,000 last financial year, or just two-thirds of the government’s desired
annual target.

A recent supreme court decision that weakened the power of US government
regulatory agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has

legal hemp, in part because of a supreme court decision that nullified the
Chevron doctrine, which once directed courts to defer to the expertise of
federal agencies. But now the reverse will apply and courts may have the final
say over even highly technical regulations.

Axel Springer has struck a €13.5bn (£11.3bn) deal that will see its media
assets, which include Politico, Business Insider and newspapers Bild and Die
Welt, hived off into a private company with the aim of building an
international digital news media powerhouse.

The move will see the German conglomerate, which last year decided against
bidding for the Daily and Sunday Telegraph because its focus is a “digital
first, digital only” acquisition strategy, become fully privately owned for
the first time since its flotation in 1985.

Europe’s car industry has called for the relaxation of EU emissions targets
after sales of electric cars stalled further in August, adding to growing
political pressure that threatens to slow the transition away from fossil
fuels.

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), a lobby group, said
that its members could face “multibillion-euro fines” because the shift to
electric production has not been quick enough to meet the EU targets.

            <p>Kahawa 1893 prioritizes small producers and premium beans, while also offering
consumers a ‘virtual pot’ to support its suppliers

When she was a child growing up in Kenya, Margaret Nyamumbo learned about a
custom that took place on her grandfather’s coffee farm: every few weeks, the
women who worked there would gather around a table and drop money into a large
pot. Anyone who had contributed had the right to later retrieve funds in the
form of a small loan.

This so-called “table banking” system, which is a custom in Kenya, helped
women involved in the coffee trade support one another. Kenyan women, who
historically are denied land ownership and therefore the ability to take out
loans, provide 90% of labor on coffee farms but own just 1% of the land.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has indefinitely postponed a staff

impartial statistics on key issues

If you stay up late enough watching TV in the US, you may come across what
appears to be a short educational program packed with numbers.

The man hosting the program may only be instantly recognizable to a handful of
people, though according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, he is currently
the eighth wealthiest person in the world.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
