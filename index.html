  * Business live – latest updates

The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed
households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis, in a heavy
blow to Rishi Sunak’s promise to kickstart growth.

The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a
larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in
all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to
Christmas.

            <p>The company pointed at people who ‘failed to update their passwords’ as
sensitive data was offered for sale on forums

Three years ago, a man in Florida named JL decided, on a whim, to send a tube
of his spit to the genetic testing site 23andMe in exchange for an ancestry
report. JL, like millions of other 23andMe participants before him, says he
was often asked about his ethnicity and craved a deeper insight into his
identity. He said he was surprised by the diversity of his test results, which
showed he had some Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.

JL said he didn’t think much about the results until he learned of a huge
breach at the company that exposed the data of nearly 7 million people, about
half of the company’s customers. Worse, he later learned of a hacker going by
the pseudonym “Golem” who had offered to sell the names, addresses and genetic
heritage reportedly belonging to 1 million 23andMe customers with similar
Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on a shadowy dark web forum. Suddenly, JL worried
his own flippant decision to catalog his genes could put him and his family at
risk.

            <p>The new ‘mixed-reality’ headset gave me a glimpse of the future – and I’m not
sure it’s a future we should want

If you ever worry that technology might be getting a little too intelligent
and robots are poised to take over the world, I have a quick and easy way to
deflate those fears: call up a company and try to ask them a simple question.
You will be put through to an automated voice system and spend the next 10
minutes yelling NO, I DIDN’T SAY THAT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN ‘YOU DIDN’T QUITE
CATCH THAT?’ I DON’T WANT ANY OF THOSE OPTIONS! PUT ME THROUGH TO A HUMAN,
GODDAMMIT!

That was certainly my experience calling up Apple and trying to reconfirm my
Vision Pro demo, which had been abruptly cancelled due to snow. But if my
phone experience felt ancient, the Apple Vision Pro headset itself felt like a
startling glimpse of the future. As it should: the thing costs $3,499.

            <p>Corded phones are hard to find these days. But for some gen Z diehards, they
offer nostalgia and real connection

Landlines are nearing obsolescence. For many young people, they’ve gone the
way of CD-Roms, cassette tapes and the humble printer. On TikTok, parents film
their children holding wall phones like archival pieces, unsure of how to
place a call. Payphones are long gone, too. But not everyone’s ready to hang
up the curly-corded receiver.

Nicole Randone, a 24-year-old from Westchester, New York, takes calls from her
bedroom using a purple Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen-branded landline first sold
in 2003, when she was three years old. “One of my first memories is the tan
landline that my parents had mounted to the kitchen wall,” Randone said. “I
always fantasized about the day I’d have one in my own room.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Datacentres are part of Ireland’s vision of itself as a tech hub. There are
now more than 80, using vast amounts of electricity. Have we entrusted our
memories to a system that might destroy them?

In the doldrum days between Christmas and New Year, we take a family trip to
see a datacentre. Over the past two decades, datacentres have become a common
sight on the outskirts of Dublin and many other Irish cities and towns.
Situated in industrial business parks, they are easy to miss. But these
buildings are critical to the maintenance of contemporary life: inside their
walls stand rows and rows of networked servers; inside the servers, terabytes
of data flow.

It’s a seven-minute drive from where we live now in Artane, Dublin, to the
Clonshaugh datacentre, situated in a business park behind Northside shopping
centre. Although we live close by, we haven’t driven this way before, and our
route takes us through a number of the local authority estates that my husband
lived in as a boy. These estates are set on either side of a long, straight
road pocked with chicanes to deter joyriders. Even though the housing
development sprawls for miles on either side – with large wind-blasted green
spaces in between – the houses huddle, squashed together. It looks as if
someone has transplanted a warren of inner-city Victorian terraces to this
desolate terrain.

Rocket company SpaceX has moved its state of incorporation to Texas from
Delaware, CEO Elon Musk has announced.

“SpaceX has moved its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas! If your
company is still incorporated in Delaware, I recommend moving to another state
as soon as possible,” Musk said on the platform.

Lyft beat estimates for fourth-quarter profits on Tuesday as the ride-share
platform reaps the benefits of growth in rides to stadiums and airports as
well as heavy cost-cutting.

Company shares surged more than 60% in extended trading but erased most of
those gains after Lyft’s chief financial officer corrected a major mistake in
the earnings report. The company had predicted it would grow by 500 basis
points (5%) in 2024, but later said that the real increase would be a factor
of 10 lower – 50 basis points (0.5%). In 2023, the stock gained about 36%.

            <p>Five years ago, there was just one. Now bookshops exclusively stocking romance
novels are everywhere – aiming to ‘undo generations of shame’

When Jonlyn Scrogham decided to open a romance novel bookstore last year in
Louisville, Kentucky, the 37-year-old had modest expectations. The space she
rented was tiny; her annual sales projections were small, too.

Though she had been an avid romance reader for decades, she wasn’t sure how
many others shared her excitement. She worried that people would think the
concept was silly, or that not many people would visit.

often worked over 60 hours a week without overtime pay.

He recalls having to tell workers who were injured on the job that they had to
deal with the injury and pay for medical care themselves. He knew the
treatment and conditions imposed on himself and his co-workers were wrong, but
he didn’t know he could do anything about it.

Russia to route military technology via third countries to its weapons
factories.

Three companies in mainland China, as well as four in Hong Kong and one in
India, are on a 91-page document of companies and individuals who EU member
states want to add to a growing sanctions list before the second anniversary
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            <p>A sustainable technique for catching tuna that goes back thousands of years is
on the verge of extinction in Italy – but not for a lack of fish

On an overcast morning, several miles off Sardinia’s east coast, four men jump
into a net where 49 giant Atlantic bluefin tuna are fighting for their lives.
For 30 minutes, the men struggle in a frenzy of nets, tails, fins and sleek
silvery bodies before finally securing a metal hook through the gills of the
nearest fish.

From one of seven wooden boats framing this _càmira dâ morti_ (“chamber of
death”), Luigi Biggio yells for his men to pull.

Death comes quickly, in a technique that, while bloody, may be more humane

            <p>Diversity-focused groups outline concerns in letter to Fortune 500 companies
amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
