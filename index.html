Screenshots that claimed a new candidate could not be added to ballots in nine

  * Business live – latest updates

Apple has lost a high-profile, €13bn (£11bn) Irish tax battle with Brussels in
a decision that will bolster the European Commission’s efforts to clamp down
on favourable “sweetheart” tax deals for multinationals.

The European court of justice (ECJ) ruling, which had been eagerly awaited,
comes after years of legal wrangling over whether the European Commission was
right to demand in 2016 that €13bn in “illegal” tax breaks for Apple should be
repaid because it gave the iPhone maker an unfair advantage.

offer are eggs any style you wish, a range of pastries and eight types of mac
and cheese. The kitchen isn’t the main point, though.

Iva Walsh, a single mother of four who immigrated to the US from the Czech
Republic in the late 1980s, opened the upstate New York establishment in 2018
to provide work opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Her roster of nine employees includes her 26-year-old daughter, after whom the
business is named. Walsh’s son, Daniel Hellmayer, a 41-year-old Culinary

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The source of new renewable energy is also a battleground over China’s cheap
exports of panels that has split US firms

The Biden administration touts solar energy as one of its big success stories,
a booming new industry that is curbing the effects of the climate crisis and
creating high-paying jobs across the country. But the more complicated truth
is that the United States is mired in a long-running trade war with China,
which is flooding the market with artificially cheap solar panels that carry
an uncomfortably large carbon footprint and threaten to obliterate the
domestic industry.

The price of solar panels has plummeted 50% over the past year, largely,
industry insiders say, because of deliberate Chinese overproduction of key
components and a game of international cat-and-mouse over trade rules often
likened to a game of “Whac-A-Mole”. As different sets of rules get
established, Chinese companies have proved adept at moving their manufacturing
plants to other countries, in south-east Asia, and shifting strategies to work
around US tariffs and other deterrent measures.

            <p>UAW Staff United says they have been ‘shut down’ for requesting same worker
protections the union champions

The United Auto Workers (UAW), one of biggest trade unions in the US, has been
accused of firing an organizer in retaliation for their role in an internal
union, and delaying bargaining over a contract.

Staff workers formed the UAW Staff United union last March. It covers UAW
employees at 34 locals across New York City, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Puerto Rico.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said the government will impose an
as-yet-undefined ban on younger teenagers and children from accessing social
media before the next election.

On Tuesday, Albanese announced the plan to introduce legislation into
parliament by the end of 2024 to block children from social media and other
digital platforms unless they are over a certain age – likely to be between 14
and 16. It will come after the $6.5m trial of age verification or assurance
technology funded in May’s budget.

            <p>DoJ accused tech giant of more monopolistic behavior a month after judge found
it illegally cornered online search

A second antitrust trial pitting Google against the US Department of Justice
began on 9 September, with a federal judge in Virginia hearing opening
statements over whether the tech giant illegally monopolized the digital
advertising industry. The case could have far-reaching implications for
Google’s primary source of revenue as well as the tech industry and online
publishers.

The long-awaited trial is the second major US antitrust suit against Google,
after the company lost a landmark case last month that determined the company
illegally monopolized the online search industry. Unlike in that trial, the
justice department is seeking specific remedies in its second case, ones that
would force Google to break up parts of its business and divest some of its
advertising technology.

  * Business live – latest updates

The EU should fear for its self-preservation as it faces a “slow and agonising
decline”, according to a hard-hitting report by the former Italian prime
minister Mario Draghi that calls for an €800bn-a-year spending boost to end
years of stagnation.

Warning that the Covid pandemic and Ukraine war had changed the rules of
international trade to the EU’s detriment, he said the bloc needed additional
investment of €750bn-€800bn a year – equivalent to 5% of the EU’s annual
economic output – to build a more resilient economy and regain previously high
rates of productivity growth.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Experts are issuing stern warnings about business support for Trump – it could
backfire badly and endanger democracy

From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, a growing number of billionaires, tech
titans and venture capitalists are backing Donald Trump’s campaign for
president, among them Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone, the world’s
largest private-equity fund, Steve Wynn, the casino tycoon, Bill Ackman, the
hedge fund manager, and Marc Andreessen, a leading venture capitalist.

But many business school professors and historians are issuing stern warnings
about this business support for Trump, saying that backing him could backfire
badly for business and endanger America’s democracy. These professors caution
that corporate America – along with everyone else – should be hugely concerned
about a candidate who has talked of being a dictator on day one, terminating
the constitution, and weaponizing the justice department to exact revenge
against his critics.

When a powerful earthquake struck near Los Angeles last month, it was a neat
metaphor for a Hollywood film industry shaken in recent years by a streaming
revolution, Covid pandemic, racial reckoning and crippling strikes. And
nowhere are the aftershocks felt more keenly than in the writers’ room.

These are collaborative spaces where writers come together to brainstorm
ideas, debate plot twists, bounce jokes off each other and punch up scripts so
they are ready for production. The formula has produced TV greats from The
Dick Van Dyke Show to Saturday Night Live, from The Simpsons to The Sopranos.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
