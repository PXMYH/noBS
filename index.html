            <p>OpenAI is seeking to build a massive new data center in India with at least
1-gigawatt capacity, scouting local partners for the project. The company&#39;s
ambitions in India coincide with rising tensions over trade between Washington
and New Delhi, with the US having imposed a tariff on Indian goods. Most of
President Donald Trump’s global tariffs were ruled illegal by a federal
appeals court that found he exceeded his authority by imposing them through an
emergency law, but the judges let the levies stay in place while the case
proceeds. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open

            <p>Advocates say Trump has hurt workers in many ways, often by cutting their pay
or making their jobs more dangerous

For this Labor Day, the Donald Trump administration has draped an enormous
banner outside the US labor department with his portrait and the words
“American Workers First.”

Trump was elected on promises, since repeatedly pledged, that he would fight
for workers and forgotten Americans. But many labor advocates say that Trump
has consistently put corporate interests first in his second term as he has

            <p>The growing threat of fires has shaken the Napa valley wine industry, as fears
of smoke-spoiled grapes and soaring insurance rates put vintners on edge

Elton Slone and his colleagues at the Robert Craig Winery in Napa valley had
gathered for their annual pre-harvest company party last week – complete with
copper pot carnitas and grape tacos – when one of his co-workers noticed an
alert on her phone. The Pickett fire, a blaze that had started about 10 miles
(16km) away near the town of Calistoga, was moving toward their vineyards on
Howell Mountain.

Knowing that the Glass fire – a 2020 blaze that damaged numerous wineries and
spoiled a year’s harvest – had burned along the same path, Slone hoped no fuel
remained for this new fire. “But that was not the case,” he said. Within the
week, the winery’s Candlestick Vineyard would become “a sacrificial lamb for
the town of Angwin” when firefighters lit a controlled burn on their property
to control the larger fire.

suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

A three-year research project into “extended minimum crew operations”
commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) found that despite
advances in technology there was not sufficient evidence that flying with a
single pilot could be as safe as with the two currently required.

on the benefits of the American way.

He boiled down his central economic ideology, and that of his Republican party
– that governments should get out of the way, allow companies, industries and
markets the space the thrive, without intervention – into a simple mantra:
_trust the people_.

on Friday.

US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number
of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these
actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like,
or the power to tax”, the court said in the 7-4 ruling.

March.

The carrier, recognizable by its bright yellow jets, has struggled to steady

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.
