            <p>A planned 30% US tariff on EU wines could hike prices, slash choice, and force
layoffs across America’s wine trade. The US wine industry warns that
distributors who rely on European bottles for most of their revenue would
collapse, hurting domestic winemakers and vintners too. While some California
grape growers hope the tariffs will level the playing field for US winemakers,
importers and retailers are skeptical that protectionism is the long-term
solution. Critics say tariffs won’t fix oversupply or falling demand and would
instead shrink the entire U.S. wine ecosystem. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers warns that President Trump’s
“One Big Beautiful Bill” may have serious long-term consequences by expanding
deficits and cutting the social safety net. While inflation from President
Trump&#39;s policies hasn’t hit yet, Summers cautions that tariffs and debt-driven
spending could have delayed effects. He also rejects Trump’s call for 1%
interest rates, saying they would spark dangerous borrowing and inflation
expectations. Meanwhile, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan notes consumers
remain strong due to wage growth, but small businesses face pressure from
trade uncertainty and high rates. (Source: Bloomberg)

loggerheads over interest rates

After years of heated attacks on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, the
Trump administration has begun suggesting recent costly renovations at the
central bank’s Washington DC buildings could justify firing Powell.

Donald Trump’s antipathy for Powell stems mainly from the central bank boss’s
refusal to lower interest rates – something the president has repeatedly
called for.

The White House is pushing for an inspection of the US Federal Reserve
headquarters in Washington after Donald Trump suggested the central bank had
mismanaged funds for building renovations.

The scrutiny comes as Trump has unsuccessfully tried to pressure the Fed
chair, Jerome Powell, to quit and demanded he and other officials lower
interest rates. Powell has said that lowering rates prematurely could lead to
higher inflation, and that Trump’s tariffs had contributed to price increases.

            <p>Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other products made from high-end
deadstocks – leftover fabrics that might otherwise end up in landfills

After more than a decade as a fashion designer, Dana Cohen was disillusioned.
Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus
samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain
of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to
be a part of it any more.’”

Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco
and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her
course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather
scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some
wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of
Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a
dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.

users’ privacy, a lawyer for the shareholders told a Delaware judge on
Thursday.

The parties did not disclose details of the settlement and defense lawyers did
not address the judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware court of chancery.
McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day and she

The Trump administration’s assault on immigrants is starting to hit the
American food supply.

In Texas, farmers who have for years depended on undocumented people for cheap
labor – to plant, harvest and haul produce – have reported that workers are
staying home to avoid raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). In
Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the
immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.

The risk of Russia- and China-backed attacks on undersea cables carrying
international internet traffic is likely to rise amid a spate of incidents in

            <p>Texas has long been under threat from the launches and explosions of SpaceX
rockets. Now Hawaii is emerging as another possible victim

The north-west Hawaiian island of Mokumanamana is said to be touched by the
gods. Bisected by the Tropic of Cancer latitude line, it is deep in the
Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs
give way to indigo blue waters dotted with monk seals and stony coral. No
humans have lived on Mokumanamana, but it has the world’s highest density of
ancient Hawaiian religious sites.

“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the
darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of
Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes,
their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up
to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re
met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can
pass into _pō_ and be with their ancestors, who inhabit the Pacific waters
west of Mokumanamana.

Europe’s largest missiles maker, MBDA, is selling key components for bombs
that have been shipped in their thousands to Israel and used in multiple
airstrikes where research indicates Palestinian children and other civilians
were killed.

With concerns mounting about the extent to which European companies may be
profiting from the devastation of Gaza, a Guardian investigation with the
independent newsrooms Disclose and Follow the Money has examined the supply
chain behind the GBU-39 bomb, and the ways in which it has been deployed
during the conflict.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
