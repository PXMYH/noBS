on Russian supplies

EU countries may soon be able to halt their last remaining Russian gas imports
under plans to ban Russian energy companies from their pipelines and
terminals.

The European Council and parliament have agreed new rules that could empower
the EU’s member states to crack down on companies from Russia and Belarus that

Paris intends to triple parking charges for large sports utility vehicles
(SUVs) in order to push them out of the city and limit emissions and air
pollution, the mayor has said.

“It is a form of social justice,” Anne Hidalgo announced on Friday of the plan
to deliberately target the richest drivers to tackle the climate breakdown and
air pollution. “This is about very expensive cars, driven by people who today
have not yet made the changes to their behaviour that have to be made [for the
climate].”

The US workforce added 199,000 _ ****_ jobs last month, a robust reading as
the world’s largest economy continues to grapple with higher interest rates.

Employment growth has been fading this year after the Federal Reserve launched
an aggressive campaign to pull back inflation from its highest levels in a
generation. Official data has bolstered hopes that the central bank will
manage to guide the US economy to a so-called “soft landing”, where price
growth normalises and recession is avoided.

            <p>Even if inflation falls, soaring debt levels, deglobalisation and populist
pressures will have an impact

Even with the recent part retreat in long-term real and nominal interest
rates, they remain well above the ultra-low levels to which policymakers had
grown accustomed, and they are likely to stay at such levels even as inflation
retreats. It is now past time to revisit the widely prevailing “free lunch”
view of government debt.

The idea that interest rates would be low for ever seemed to support the view
that any concern about debt was an endorsement of “austerity”. Many came to
believe that governments should run large deficits during recessions and only
slightly smaller deficits in normal times. No one seemed concerned with the
possible risks, in particular to inflation and interest rates. The left
championed the notion that government debt could be used to expand social
programmes, going beyond what could be generated by reducing military
spending, while those on the right seemed to believe that taxes exist only to
be cut.

            <p>Experts advise the city’s first AAPI female bookstore owner on a plan to
reopen Yu &amp; Me Books in its original location in Chinatown

For Lucy Yu, who runs what’s believed to be New York City’s first Asian
American woman-owned bookstore, losing her brick-and-mortar business was akin
to losing a child. But since 4 July of this year, when a blaze engulfed the
Chinatown building that housed Yu &amp; Me Books, the 29-year-old has had little
time to process her grief.

Within hours of the blaze, she shifted into rebuild mode: right after
firefighters brought the fire under control, Yu and a friend ran into the
store and hauled inventory into plastic bags and tarps. They salvaged a couple
thousand books from the wreckage, just under half of the collection. The
effort left Yu coughing and short of breath for the next two weeks.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
