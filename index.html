            <p>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 10:52:33 CDT</p>
            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>President Donald Trump said he’s not planning to fire Jerome Powell, and still
managed to make it sound like a threat. Trump’s comments capped a hectic few
hours that took his pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve chief to a
new level -- and sent markets into a shortlived nosedive. He ran the idea of
sacking Powell by a group of Republican lawmakers late Tuesday. An aide said
Wednesday morning he was likely to follow through. Then the president publicly
backpedaled – with a major caveat. “I don’t rule out anything, but I think
it’s highly unlikely, unless he has to leave for fraud,” Trump said.
Elsewhere, Trump has dialed down his confrontational tone with China in an
effort to secure a summit with counterpart Xi Jinping and a trade deal with
the world’s second-largest economy. Today&#39;s guests: Emmanuel Cau, Barclays

away from a Global North-led economy says Robin Niblett, Distinguished Fellow

its dependence on the US, it must make its trade proposition to the Global
South more attractive than simply buying up other countries&#39; commodities,
argues Niblett. He spoke to Francine Lacqua on &#39;Bloomberg: The Pulse&#39; (Source:

The Port of Antwerp-Bruges has been turned into a giant car park with
thousands of cars, vans, trucks and tractors bound for the US sitting idle as
manufacturers try to avert the worst of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Figures released by the port show a 15.9% drop in the transport of new

with the same period last year, with a sharp decline emerging in May – one
month after the US president announced his “liberation day” tariffs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
