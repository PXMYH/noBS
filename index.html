Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) is moving forward with a $6.475bn proposed settlement

talcum-powder products were contaminated with asbestos and caused ovarian
cancer, the company said on Wednesday in a statement.

The company discontinued sales of its baby powder in North America in 2020,
and worldwide in 2023. The company now sells a cornstarch-based formula,

            <p>The British brand has entered the booming market in luxury ‘car-chitecture’,
opening a themed tower in Miami boasting ballroom, helipad and infinity pool –
all offering millionaires a perfect view of our choking, collapsing world

Move over, James Bond – a new Aston Martin has rolled into town, brimming with
more flashy features than Q could ever dream of. Parked ostentatiously on the
Miami waterfront, overlooking a private marina brimming with superyachts, its
streamlined flanks glisten in the Florida sunshine, housing an interior
trimmed with the finest leathers and exotic wood veneers. There’s no ejector
seat or rocket-launcher, but it is the biggest Aston Martin ever made –
housing Jacuzzi, bar, cinema, golf simulator, art gallery, ballroom and
infinity pool, all crowned with a 66th-storey helipad.

Unveiled in the week of the Miami Grand Prix, the latest exclusive model from
the timeless British automotive brand is not a high-performance sports car,
but an ultra-luxury apartment building – the tallest residential tower in the
US, south of New York. After Aston Martin’s years of financial woes, following
a disastrous stock market performance since the company’s 2018 listing, it
seems that the boutique car-  
maker is seeking salvation in property development.

company last year

Changpeng Zhao, the former head of the world’s largest cryptocurrency trading
company, was sentenced to four months in jail on Tuesday in a Seattle
courtroom. Zhao pleaded guilty late last year to money-laundering violations
and stepped down as CEO of Binance. The company itself was fined $4.3bn. Zhao
was fined $50m last year.

Judge Richard Jones told Zhao that there were a number of mitigating factors
in his sentencing, including that he had cooperated with law enforcement.
Jones also cited numerous letters the court had received that testified to

reoffend.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
