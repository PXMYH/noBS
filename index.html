proceedings as contentious as his fraud trial

Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX,
presided over a spectacular collapse that cost his customers billions of
dollars. He argues in court filings that anyone owed money by FTX “will
eventually be paid in full”. The US government says he’s living in a fantasy
land.

Last week, FTX’s caretaker, John Ray III, appointed to oversee the company’s
bankruptcy proceedings, reminded the court that Bankman-Fried had masterminded
a “colossal fraud”, lived a “life of delusion”, and called Bankman-Fried’s
lawyers’ claim that no one had been harmed as “categorically, callously, and
demonstrably false”.

Katy Slininger was one of dozens of residents who moved into the Lofts at the
Cargill Falls Mill in Putnam, Connecticut, shortly after it opened in late
2020, enticed by the historic charm of the building and affordability of an
apartment in an area with significant affordable housing shortages.

The building is a redeveloped 19th-century mill that opened in 2020 after
government subsidies contributed millions of dollars in grants and tax credits
to its renovation and was hailed by local officials as a boon to the local
economy.

            <p>Downing of Francis Scott Key Bridge disrupts shipping of cars and parts and
risks loss of Baltimore’s cargo trade to other ports

  *  **Baltimore bridge collapse – latest updates**

The US transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, warned of “major and
protracted impact to supply chains” following the closure of the Port of
Baltimore for the forseeable future after Tuesday’s catastrophic bridge
collapse, though some experts said the impact was likely to be targeted to
particular regions and industries.

Spanning more than 2km and with four lanes of traffic, the Francis Scott Key
Bridge – a vital artery in Baltimore’s industrial heartland – took nine years

Each man enters the room, one by one, escaping the dark night outside. Before
long some two dozen are sitting in a horseshoe. They hail from different

to share their stories, and listen to others, in the hope of turning their
lives around. Veterans of the 12-step program say it is now experiencing a
sharp rise in interest from troubled young addicts.

            <p>Operator also found by Amsterdam court to have painted ‘overly rosy picture’
of sustainable aviation fuel

The Dutch airline KLM has misled customers with vague environmental claims and
painted “an overly rosy picture” of its sustainable aviation fuel, a court has
found.

In a greenwashing case brought by the campaign group Fossielvrij, the district
court of Amsterdam ruled on Wednesday that KLM had broken the law with
misleading advertising in 15 of the 19 environmental statements it assessed.
They include claims that the airline is moving towards a “more sustainable”
future and statements on its website about the benefits of offsetting a
flight.

that has ‘a lot of symbolic significance’ according to analysts

Japan’s central bank has ended eight years of negative interest rates, in an
overhaul of one of the world’s most aggressive monetary easing programmes that
sought to encourage bank lending and spur demand.

In its first interest rate hike in 17 years, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] said it
was lifting its short-term policy rate from -0.1% to between zero and 0.1%,
although analysts said a fragile economic recovery meant it would continue go
slow with any further rise in borrowing costs.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
