fail to honor their shelf prices – charging more at checkout for everything
from frying pans to Frosted Flakes

On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield
walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a
scanner gun and a laptop.

Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut

Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch authorized a plan for Fox News to embrace Donald
Trump’s false claims of election fraud in 2020 in an attempt to win back
viewers angry with the network, a lawyer for the voting technology company
Smartmatic argued on Tuesday.

“The conservative viewers, their bread and butter, abandoned them,” J Erik
Connolly told the New York state supreme court judge David B Cohen. “So what
do they do? They return back to what they know best: they return back to
disinformation, pro-Trump propaganda and xenophobia. The election story and
the election fraud claims was the perfect vehicle for them to get back on to
their core messaging.”

Bitcoin’s value has fallen sharply since the start of October and erased a

Barely a year after Brian Niccol, the Starbucks CEO, tried to draw a line

  * Politics live –latest updates

Britain’s budget watchdog has said the early leak of its budget documents
before Rachel Reeves made her speech was the “worst failure” in its 15-year
history as it emerged a similar breach had occurred earlier this year.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said an investigation had found
that the leadership of the organisation, over many years, was to blame for the
early release of its Economic and Fiscal Outlook (EFO) document online nearly
an hour before Reeves’s address last Wednesday.

Airbus has fixed most of its jets affected by a software glitch after a
technical problem grounded thousands of its planes, but its shares tumbled on
Monday after it discovered a separate issue with its fuselage panels.

Airlines around the world cancelled and delayed flights over the weekend after
the French plane manufacturer ordered immediate repairs to 6,000 of its A320
family of jets, more than half of its global fleet.

TikTok finds and homemade gifts, trips to the mall and the endless search for
“dupes” – gen Z’s shopping habits are shaking up retail in the run-up to
Christmas. And with price tags climbing and brand loyalty slipping, retailers
this season must work harder to earn this generation’s dollar.

Gen Z’s spending power is expected to near $12tn by 2030. But this year those
aged 13 to 28 are expected to cut their holiday spending by a whopping 23% – a
sharper decline compared to other generations – according to a recent PwC
report.

            <p>Will the bubble ravage the economy when it bursts? What will it leave of value
once it pops?

The California Gold Rush left an outsized imprint on America. Some 300,000
people flocked there from 1848 to 1855, from as far away as the Ottoman
Empire. Prospectors massacred Indigenous people to take the gold from their
lands in the Sierra Nevada mountains. And they boosted the economies of nearby
states and faraway countries from whence they bought their supplies.

Gold provided the motivation for California – a former Mexican territory then
controlled by the US military – to become a state with laws of its own. And
yet, few “49ers” as prospectors were known, struck it rich. It was the
merchants selling prospectors food and shovels who made the money. One, a
Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss who sold denim overalls to the gold bugs
passing through San Francisco, may be the most remembered figure of his day.

Karp fields no questions about Palantir’s controversial ties to ICE but
instead extolls the company’s virtues, brandishes a sword and discusses how he
exhumed the remains of his childhood dog Rosita to rebury them near his
current home.

“That’s really sweet,” host Molly O’Shea tells Karp.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
