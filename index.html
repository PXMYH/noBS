The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday dropped a legal action

consumers out of more than $2bn in interest payments on savings accounts.

confirmation hearing.

Donald Trump’s threatened 25% tariffs on EU imports could trigger “economic
turmoil”, sharply push down growth and send inflation soaring, according to a
German thinktank.

The Kiel Institute said the US president’s promise on Wednesday that he would
impose the levies “very soon” was a profound moment in the postwar
relationship between Washington and Brussels and could prove to be an economic
shock to both parties.

The Trump administration is pushing for federal agencies to carry out a large-
scale slashing of the federal workforce, demanding plans for hundreds of
thousands of possible cuts within weeks.

A White House memo gave officials until 13 March to submit a plan identifying
“agency components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute
or regulation who are not typically designated as essential” during government
shutdowns.

            <p>Harris poll finds 51% of Americans think US economy is worsening with views on
Trump tariffs split on party lines

The majority of Americans believe the economy is getting worse rather than
better, even as Republican views on the nation’s finances have performed a
dramatic backflip since Donald Trump’s re-election, according to an exclusive
poll conducted for the Guardian.

One month into Trump’s second presidency, a Harris poll found that 51% of
Americans now believe that the US economy is worsening, while just 20% said it
was improving and 29% said it was the same.

39% of Republicans now believe the US economy is improving compared with just
8% last May. Over a quarter, 26%, believe it is worsening compared to 70% last
May.

69% of Democrats now believe the US economy is getting worse compared with 36%
last May; 11% think it is getting better compared with 32% last May.

Independent voters’ views have shifted the least with 12% believing the
economy is improving (11% last May) and 56% thinking it is getting worse (59%
last May).

49% of all polled said tariffs will have a negative impact on the US economy.

43% of Republicans, 17% of Democrats and 19% of independents said the impact
would be positive.

28% of Republicans, 63% of Democrats and 54% of independents said it will have
a negative impact.

years before the Eaton fire destroyed it

Bruce Steele has always said he would die defending his house – and his
beehives. Long before the Eaton fire began its destructive march through the
California foothills last month, the beekeeper was already on perpetual alert:
watering the flower garden of his family’s house in Altadena, California,
cleaning dry leaves out of the roof gutters and soaking the precious oak trees
that surrounded the property.

When the Santa Ana winds picked up, Nancy, Bruce’s wife and business partner,
was out of town, so their daughter, Clara, 35, rushed over to help. The two
generations immediately started gathering family photos and mementoes. They
scooped up a painting Bruce’s sister made as a wedding gift. Other treasures
included an old robot toy from the 1965 TV show Lost in Space, as well as a
threadbare T-shirt from Occidental College, the school where Bruce and Nancy
first met – and where he would go on to work for more than 35 years.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
