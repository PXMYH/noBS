without pay to keep services running

As the US federal shutdown enters its second month, government workers are

people who are “simply trying to do their best”.

The shutdown surpassed 35 days this week, beating the previous record set

Donald Trump faced arguably the biggest test so far of his contentious use of
executive power at the US supreme court on Wednesday. The stakes could not be
higher – “literally, LIFE OR DEATH” for the US, at least according to the
president.

forward a somewhat puzzling argument.

If Elon Musk can grow Tesla to over $8tn in value for stockholders over the
next decade, he will be well on his way to becoming the world’s first
trillionaire.

That is if stockholders approve the company’s latest proposed compensation
plan for the “Superstar CEO”, as a judge once called him, at this week’s
annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas, set for Thursday afternoon.

The deaths from pollution caused by Europe’s biggest plastic plant, which is
being built in Antwerp, will outstrip the number of permanent jobs it will
create, lawyers will argue in a court challenge issued on Thursday.

In documents submitted to the court, research suggests the air pollution from
Ineos’s €4bn petrochemical plant would cause 410 deaths once operational,
compared with the 300 permanent jobs the company says will be created.

The French equalities regulator has declared that Facebook’s algorithm for
placing job adverts is sexist, after an investigation found that adverts for
mechanic roles skewed towards men while those for preschool teachers were
targeted at women.

The Défenseur des Droits watchdog said the Facebook system for targeted job
ads treated users differently based on their sex, and constituted indirect
discrimination. The regulator recommended that Facebook and its parent
company, Meta, took measures to ensure adverts were non-discriminatory, giving
the company three months to inform the French body of the measures.

The return to Earth of three Chinese astronauts has been delayed until an

The three astronauts from the Shenzhou-20 mission flew to the Tiangong space
station in April, and were expected to return on Wednesday at the end of a six
month mission. Their replacements, the crew of Shenzhou-21, had already
arrived on the weekend.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
