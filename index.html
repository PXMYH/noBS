A power outage in the Channel tunnel has disrupted thousands of journeys ahead
of the new year celebrations, with all passenger and vehicle trains suspended
for several hours while engineers raced to repair the fault.

As Eurostar foot passenger departures for the continent were first delayed,
then cancelled, the halls of St Pancras International station in London filled
with stranded travellers awaiting updates. At Folkestone in Kent, tailbacks
formed as drivers hoping to catch the shuttle faced seven-hour delays.

In January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that
Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms.
Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of
investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972
Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a
symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.

One investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up
virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud
services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut
off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the
Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through
the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon
had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.

When Elon Musk vowed late last year to lead a “department of government

it set about saving $2tn worth of waste and exposing massive fraud.

Today, with Musk out of the White House, Doge having cut only a tiny fraction
of the waste it promised, and dozens of lawsuits alleging violations of
privacy and transparency laws, much of what the agency has done remains a
mystery.

            <p>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters
that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who is retiring at the end of 2025,
has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway
conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s
performance.

Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire
morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder
equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.

Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large
northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.

My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a
practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when
you are buying businesses).

Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being
bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’

When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much
as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex
life. It’s not a push he needs.

Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger
companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes
was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s
been swimming naked.)

In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction,
carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone
seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also
whom they are sleeping with.

From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for
ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives
books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that
are required.

When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors
carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.

Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s
promised to attend _my_ 100th.

She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After
retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other
Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)

The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to
work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.

(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the
portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term
‘thinking outside the box’.)

suggesting he would like to fire him.

Trump launched his latest attack on Powell during a press conference with
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeating false claims about the
cost of a renovation of the central bank headquarters, and told reporters that
he might file a lawsuit against Powell for “gross incompetence”.

Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse
compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.

similar poll that was conducted in February.

Beijing accuses Tokyo of fuelling a ‘space arms race’

Japan’s cabinet has approved a record high defence budget as tensions with
China continue to spiral, with Beijing this week accusing Tokyo of “fuelling a
space arms race”.

The draft defence budget for the next fiscal year – approved on Friday – is
more than ¥9tn ($58bn) and 9.4% bigger than the previous budget, which will
end in April. The increase comes in the fourth year of Japan’s five-year
program to double its annual arms spending to 2% of GDP.

pots.

Farage is paid more than four times his MPs’ salary for the four-hour-a-month
job at Direct Bullion, where he has featured in Facebook and YouTube videos.

            <p>Tashkent Supermarket’s new West Village location offers staples like _plov_
and _samsas_ hot and fresh – a taste of Central Asia for everyone

When I first stepped into the Tashkent Supermarket in Brighton Beach, I could
barely get around. The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling
faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods like _manty_ –
intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on
where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Or _chak-chak_ , a
dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey
syrup. _Kompot,_ too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.

Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home.
_Manty_ was one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she
was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin,
yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to
have soda or sugary drinks, but homemade _kompot_ with fruits and berries from
our garden was an exception. And though I never mastered _chak-chak_ , the
store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across
other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always find
_plov_ and _samsas_ at eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.
