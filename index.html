The trial into the “dieselgate” emissions scandal, which plunged Volkswagen
into disrepute nine years ago, has opened with the German carmaker’s former
chief executive appearing in the dock for the first time.

Volkswagen, widely viewed as a symbol of German economic success and technical

The Baltimore houses are in rough shape. They might be missing roofs, or even
floors. Some have been inhabited by squatters. Rats come in. Cats follow. As
David Lidz, founder of the Waterbottle Co-op, which rehabilitates the
foreclosed homes, points out, the contents are hard to view dispassionately.

“When a family leaves, most of the time they leave a ton of stuff there,” he

As gambling companies target social media users, the four leading online
brands appear to be routinely breaching the industry’s self-imposed marketing
regulations, according to a new study.

Over one week this summer, academics at the University of Bristol found that

that did not include problem gambling support messages or a helpline number.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In her new book Strike, Sarah Bond explains how Roman workers banded together
– much like labor organizing today

Labor Day has come around again, and workers’ rights are now center stage in
North America. Canadian railworkers nearly brought trade to a juddering halt
in a dispute with rail firms. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are courting
union members as they fight for the White House even as union leaders call the

I’ve never had a pumpkin spice latte. It’s not because I have anything against
the seasonal bestseller from Starbucks, which has become an unofficial herald

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
