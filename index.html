a trilateral and I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war
when we do that,” Trump told reporters Monday during an Oval Office meeting
with Zelenskiy. The tone between the two leaders was notably improved from
Zelenskiy’s last visit to the Oval Office in February, which erupted into a
bitter public clash with Trump and briefly led to the US halting military
support. Bloomberg News Managing Editor for US Economy and Government Mario

            <p>General Ben Hodges, former commander of the US Army in Europe, said NATO
allies likely will have to take a much bigger role in guaranteeing Ukraine&#39;s
security and enforcing a ceasefire. US President Donald Trump said he hoped to
secure an agreement for a trilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr
Zelenskiy as he welcomed the Ukrainian leader to the White House for high-
stakes talks on bringing an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine. “If everything
works out well today we’ll have a trilat and I think there will be a
reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that,” Trump told reporters
Monday during an Oval Office meeting with Zelenskiy. “We’re going to work with
everybody, and we’re going to make sure that if there’s peace the peace is
going to stay long term.” (Source: Bloomberg)

Union leaders representing 10,000 striking flight attendants have said they
would be willing to go to jail rather than comply with an order to return to
work, as Canada’s federal government seeks to end a bitter contract dispute
that has halted hundreds of summer flights and stranded travellers around the
world.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, the national president of the Canadian Union
of Public Employees said members would remain on the picket lines as part of a
work stoppage that has halted Air Canada’s national and international
operations during its busiest season.

Coffee shops in the heart of New York are bracing for impact.

A federal appeals court set the stage for the Trump administration to resume

consumer groups to file for a review of the case by the full circuit court of
appeals for the District of Columbia.

matter to be denied, calling it ‘so strained’ as to ‘defy credulity’

Universal Music Group has denied new allegations made by Drake’s lawyers that
its British chair and chief executive Lucian Grainge had a “role in and
knowledge of the scheme to defame and harass” the Canadian rapper by peer
Kendrick Lamar, and that as such the label should “collect, review and
produce” communications by Grainge.

Drake is suing UMG – his label Republic’s parent company – over its release of
Lamar’s 2024 diss track Not Like Us, which contains the line: “Say, Drake, I
hear you like ’em young … Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles.” The
artwork for the global hit single features an image of Drake’s home dotted
with icons used to identify the homes of registered sex offenders.

Shares in Intel have jumped 7.4% after it was reported that the Trump
administration is considering taking a stake in the struggling US chipmaker.

The potential investment, which would be paid for by the US government, would
be used to develop Intel’s factory hub in Ohio, according to Bloomberg. It
would also help shore up the chipmaker’s finances at a time when Intel has
been slashing jobs as part of a wider cost-cutting drive.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
