            <p>Judge said tech giant had monopoly but let it keep Chrome and Android; critics
cried foul while Wall Street cheered

A judge ruled on Tuesday that Google would not be forced to sell its Chrome
browser or the Android operating system, saving the tech giant from the most

maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.

Groups critical of Google’s dominance in the internet search and online
advertising industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity
to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the
crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by

disputed territory

China is drilling for oil and gas inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), a move that analysts believe is likely part of Beijing’s unilateral
grab for disputed territory that could also aid a future invasion of Taiwan.

During July and August at least 12 oil and gas vessels and permanent
structures were detected inside Taiwan’s EEZ – including one within 50km of

Gold rose above $3,500 (£2,614) an ounce, surpassing its April peak. It has

government bonds, known as US treasuries.

            <p>Regulator Easa concludes there is not enough evidence it is as safe as flying
with two pilots as currently required

Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the
cockpit have been put on ice after a report for the European regulator
suggested it would make flying more dangerous.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
