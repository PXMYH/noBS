            <p>As the White House carries out an anti-worker agenda, labor leaders fear
corporate America could also grow more hostile

Donald Trump’s aggressive wave of anti-union actions is already spurring some
US employers to take a more hostile stance toward unions, as labor leaders
voice fears that the president’s moves will embolden more and more companies
to fight harder against unions and slow their recent progress.

Indeed, some worker advocates worry that unions will be walloped during
Trump’s second term the way they were under Ronald Reagan after he crushed the
1981 air traffic controllers’ strike and inspired many corporations to fight
harder against unions. As Trump and Elon Musk carry out their anti-union
agenda in Washington DC, Utah passed a law that prohibits collective
bargaining by public sector workers, and a Michigan company refused to move
forward with a union election.

  * Business live – latest updates

UK house prices have suffered their steepest decline in a year as the market
cools after a buyer rush to beat stamp duty changes in England and Northern
Ireland.

The average price of a property fell by 0.5% last month to £296,699, the

Many cities across southern China are known for the art of relaxing. Chengdu
in Sichuan province is the tea house capital. Guangzhou is the birthplace of
dim sum, a time to share steamed dumplings and chew the fat with friends. And
in Haikou, the capital of Hainan province, people have been chewing the betel
nut for centuries.

You don’t have to walk far in Haikou to find a vendor. The small, hard, green
fruits are sold in little piles alongside fresh coconuts and bottled water at
pretty much any convenience store, for about five yuan (£0.52) a piece. Some
vendors, mostly women, sit by the side of the road to dish out betel nuts to
passing drivers on mopeds, nearly all of them men.

Senior officials within Donald Trump’s administration gave conflicting
messages on Sunday about the US president’s global tariffs that have caused a
meltdown in stock markets, prompted warnings of a world recession and provoked
rare expressions of dissent from within his Republican party.

Cabinet members fanned out across Sunday’s political talk shows armed with
talking points on Trump’s 10% across-the-board tariff on almost all US

Percy Pig’s US invasion could be called to a halt amid fears that Donald
Trump’s tariffs could affect sales of Marks &amp; Spencer’s popular confectionery
brand which has just launched in Target stores across the Atlantic.

Archie Norman, the chair of M&amp;S, has described Percy as the retailer’s “gift
to America” but he told the Retail Technology Show in London that “we might
have to change our minds” as Trump imposes additional taxes on imported goods.
While M&amp;S is not considering withdrawing the sweets, tariffs could push up
prices and make them less popular.

            <p>Zahra Tabatabai’s Back Home Beer features select Middle Eastern flavors, and
she’s looking to expand its reach nationally

Business heats up for Zahra Tabatabai in March, the month of Nowruz, the
13-day Persian new year festival, which begins this year on 20 March. The
Iranian American Brooklynite’s craft beers are infused with Middle Eastern
flavors such as sumac and sour cherry, and packaged in design-forward cans
featuring poetry in intricate Farsi lettering.

Tabatabai’s grandfather used to make his own beer with ingredients from his
garden in Shiraz, before the Iranian government instituted a ban on alcohol
consumption in 1979. More recently, her grandmother longed to taste her
husband’s beer again, so Tabatabai set out to satisfy her yen. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, while working as a freelance writer and overseeing the home
schooling of her son, who is now 11, she started looking at recipes and
enrolled in a home-brewing class, and began watching YouTube videos about the
art of making beer.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
