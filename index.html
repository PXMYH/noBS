startup’s founder claims but details are scant

The first human patient implanted with a brain-chip from Neuralink appears to
have fully recovered and is able to control a computer mouse using their
thoughts, the startup’s founder, Elon Musk, said late on Monday.

“Progress is good, and the patient seems to have made a full recovery, with no
ill effects that we are aware of. Patient is able to move a mouse around the
screen by just thinking,” Musk said in a Spaces event on the social media
platform X.

            <p>Aarhus court hears he may have profited from artificially generated playbacks,
in case thought to be first of its kind

A Danish man has gone on trial in the city of Aarhus over accusations that he
fraudulently made 4.38m kroner (more than £502,000) in royalties on music
streaming sites, in what is thought to be the first such trial of its kind.

Prosecutors allege that the 53-year-old profited from streams of 689 pieces of
music across services including Spotify, Apple Music and YouSee Musik. They
say the huge numbers of streams required to generate that amount of money
could not have been generated by genuine users and that unauthorised
techniques were likely to have been deployed instead. The alleged fraud is
understood to have happened between 2013 and 2019.

arrests, and the authorities promised on Tuesday to repurpose the technology
to expose the group’s operations to the world.

Joe Biden has spent most of his presidency insisting to Americans that the
economy is on the right track. Poll after poll has shown that most voters do
not believe him. That may be changing.

After months of resilient hiring, better-than-expected economic growth and a
declining rate of inflation, new data shows that Americans are becoming upbeat
about the US economy, potentially reversing the deep pessimism Biden has
struggled to counter for much of the past three years.

The world’s five largest listed oil companies have made profits of more than a
quarter of a trillion dollars since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to
dramatic increases in energy prices and household bills.

The “super-majors” – BP, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies – have

Witness.

            <p>Investors in one of the country’s ailing financial trusts have realised that
the state may no longer always protect them

Wang Jin felt sure that he could invest in Sichuan Trust, an institution that
was part of one of what he describes as the “four pillars” of China’s
financial system: banks, securities, insurance and trusts. **** Promised a
return on his investment of 8.3%, he handed over 1.6m yuan (£178,000) in 2019.
“The trust had a state licence, so we believed in its integrity,” Wang (not
his real name) recalls.

Unluckily for him, in May 2020, the company said that it would be unable to
repay 20bn yuan of investments. Protests ensued, with hundreds of middle-aged
investors gathering outside the headquarters in Chengdu to demand their money
back. By the end of the year, the local government had taken over the firm,
which was reported to have a shortfall of more than 30bn yuan on its books,
although the company said the sum was closer to 25bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>While the Red Sea resort of Dahab draws those who earn dollars and can work
anywhere, a third of Egyptians live in poverty and see a perilous voyage to
Europe as their only hope

Bordered by the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, Egypt is a country blessed with
many miles of coastline, and its resorts have long been tourist favourites.
But in a country in which the divide between rich and poor has always been
stark, Egypt’s recent economic woes have had a seismic effect on society – and
nowhere illustrates that better than the fortunes of those making their way to
the country’s two coasts.

Along the Red Sea’s Gulf of Aqaba, the once-quiet fishing outpost of Dahab has
become a haven for well-off young digital nomads. Its warm turquoise waters
and hipster vibes have transformed the small town into a popular diving
resort, making it the perfect location for those looking for a more flexible
work-life balance.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

I run a small business. My company sells customer relationship management

tea. But I’ve been a longtime active user and I’m sure there are many other
Xers who would enjoy reading my book. So I decided to conduct an experiment
and create a post with a link to my book’s landing page and promote it on the
social platform. Not a big promotion. Just 50 bucks over five days. A
pittance. But, for me, what happened is a cautionary tale.

            <p>Diversity-focused groups outline concerns in letter to Fortune 500 companies
amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
