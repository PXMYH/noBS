Javier Milei, Argentina’s president, is set to meet with the leaders of some
of the world’s largest tech companies in Silicon Valley this week. The far-
right libertarian leader will hold private talks with Sundar Pichai of Google,
Sam Altman of OpenAI, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Tim Cook of Apple.

Milei also met last month with Elon Musk, who has become one of the South
American president’s most prominent cheerleaders and repeatedly shared his
pro-deregulation, anti-social justice message on X (formerly Twitter). Peter
Thiel, the tech billionaire, has also twice visited Milei, flying to Buenos
Aires to speak with him in February and May of this year.

On a recent Friday night in San Jose, California, a small group of Spanish-
speaking renters sat in the clubhouse of their apartment complex wondering
whether the room was bugged. “Let them listen,” said a young man, with a
dismissive gesture.

They were meeting to strategize about forming a tenants’ association to
bargain collectively with their large corporate landlord. Along one wall of
the room hung large white posters with the names and unit numbers of residents
and their yes-or-no response to a survey about their willingness to
participate in a rent strike.

            <p>Service members are more likely than the general public to become problem
gamblers, but screening – and help – is lacking

Dave Yeager didn’t join the US army to become a pathological gambler. But
after re-enlisting as a food inspection specialist in the wake of 9/11, Yeager
arrived at his base hotel in Seoul, Korea, feeling overwhelmed and restless.
“I’m walking around and find a casino-style slot machine room,” says the
57-year-old former sergeant. “As soon as I sat down, the first thing I noticed
was that my shoulders started to relax. Then I won, and it was like a dopamine
hit. In that moment, all of the fear and anger and stress that I was feeling
just went away.”

Suddenly and without warning, a night of gambling here and there became a
seven-day-a-week addiction – one that had him phoning home for more money,
pawning personal effects and stealing from his unit. When a demotion in rank
failed to curb Yeager’s reckless behavior, his bosses threw up their hands.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
