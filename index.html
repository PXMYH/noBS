            <p>Ludovic Subran, chief investment officer at Allianz, discusses the retaliatory
tax item buried in President Donald Trump’s massive fiscal package. The item,
in legislation that passed the House as Section 899, would increase rates for
individuals and companies from countries whose tax policies the US deems
“discriminatory.” Wall Street analysts are warning the provision would create
another disincentive for foreign investors. Subran speaks on Bloomberg

  * Business live – latest updates

China has accused the US of “seriously violating” the fragile US-China detente
that has been in place for less than a month since the two countries agreed to
pause the trade war that risked upending the global economy.

China and the US agreed on 12 May to pause for 90 days the skyrocketing
“reciprocal” tariffs that both countries had placed on the others goods in a
frenzied trade war that started a few weeks earlier. Tariffs had reached 125%
on each side, which officials feared amounted to virtual embargo on trade
between the world’s two biggest economies.

Workers’ rights across every continent in the world are in a “freefall”,
according to the 2025 Global Rights Index released by the International Trade
Union Confederation, the largest trade union federation in the world.

The index noted workers’ rights and democracy around the world are often under
attack by “far-right politicians and their unelected billionaire backers.
Whether it’s Donald Trump and Elon Musk in the US or Javier Milei and Eduardo
Eurnekian in Argentina, we see the same playbook of unfairness and

Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the age of 94 from Berkshire
Hathaway. Donald Trump’s behavior, at the age of 78, continues to raise
concern, if not alarm.

When are people too old to do their jobs?

When millions of people across the Iberian peninsula were left without power
last month the political fallout ignited debate over Europe’s renewable energy
agenda, and fuelled the rising interest in nuclear power.

Europe’s largest power blackout in decades, still largely unexplained, has
raised questions about whether renewable energy can be relied on to provide a
stable source of clean energy. It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the
global nuclear power renaissance already under way.

Hospitality venues in France such as hotels, restaurants and campsites that do
not admit children could face prosecution under proposals for a crackdown that
emerged this week.

Laurence Rossignol, a socialist senator, plans to introduce a private member’s
bill to make it illegal to ban children from such establishments, the Times
reported, while the French high commissioner for childhood, Sarah El Haïry,
said government lawyers were looking into whether it would be possible to take
legal action against places that exclude families.

As the first Pride month under Donald Trump’s second presidency approaches,
LGBTQ+ businesses are stepping up, evolving quickly to meet the community’s
growing concerns.

Since day one, Trump has signed executive orders targeting the LGBTQ+
community, particularly the trans and gender non-conforming population. He
aims to eradicate “gender ideology” by enforcing a two-sex binary determined
at conception, reinstating and expanding the military ban on transgender
service members, and directing agencies to prevent gender-affirming care for
youth.

If you want a bellwether to measure the broad impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs
on the economy, look south, to Georgia. The political swing state has a $900bn
economy – somewhere between the GDPs of Taiwan and Switzerland.

The hospitality industry is facing an existential crisis. Wine merchants
wonder aloud if they will survive the year. But others, like those in
industrial manufacturing, will carefully argue that well-positioned businesses
will profit. Some say they’re insulated from international competition by the
nature of their industry. Others, like the movie industry, are simply confused
by the proposals that have been raised, and are looking for entirely different
answers. So far, it’s a mixed bag.

“Tariffs are easy,” Donald Trump claimed in March. For his administration, and
the world, they have proven anything but. Now an obscure New York court has
blocked his signature trade policy, setting up a battle that looks sure to end
up in the supreme court.

The plan was simple. For decades, Trump has made the case for tariffs. Now, in
his second term, he would dramatically hike them on the world; raise trillions
of dollars for the federal government; cut taxes for Americans; and lure
manufacturers to the country’s industrial heartlands, creating millions of
jobs.

Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel during a rally in Pennsylvania.

Surrounded by men in orange hardhats at a US Steel plant in West Mifflin,
Trump unveiled the new levies, declaring that the dramatic rate increase would
“even further secure the steel industry in the United States”.

says is direct result of Donald Trump’s campaign to eradicate diversity,

Google and Home Depot both announced their plans to abandon the festival in
the form of one-line emails, said Kojo Modeste, the executive director of the

            <p>After her former label sold her catalogue in 2019, Swift embarked on her
lucrative album rerecording project – but now owns the originals for the first
time

Taylor Swift has bought back the master recordings to her first six albums,
giving her control over her entire catalogue for the first time. “I almost
stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot
dangled and then yanked away,” she wrote in a letter to fans. “But that’s all
in the past now. All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”

She originally lost the rights in 2019 when her first record label, Big
Machine, sold them to music executive Scooter Braun. Swift described the sale
to Braun as her “worst case scenario”, and said she had not been given the
opportunity to buy her work outright, but to “earn” one album back for each
new album she recorded for the label. Her subsequent albums, from 2019’s Lover
onwards, were released on Republic, with Swift retaining the rights to the
master recordings.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Published time -->
            <p>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 11:00:12 CDT</p>
            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility
