            <p>In every issue of Markets Magazine, Bloomberg News journalists go in depth
with a key newsmaker, an industry up-and-comer or disruptor. This time, we
spoke to Max Levchin, Founder and CEO of Affirm. He doesn’t think you should
be buying a cup of coffee on a revolving credit line and have to pay it off
over the next decade. That&#39;s the elevator pitch for Affirm and other players
in the world of “Buy Now, Pay Later” finance. BNPL, as it’s often called,
promises to be an alternative to high interest credit cards and a lifetime of
debt. (Source: Bloomberg)

Meta has allowed its social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram, to become
marketplaces for child predators, the state of New Mexico alleges in a lawsuit
filed against the company and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.

The lawsuit claims that Meta “proactively served and directed [children] to
egregious, sexually explicit images through recommended users and posts – even
where the child has expressed no interest in this content”. It claims Meta
“enabled adults to find, message and groom minors, soliciting them to sell
pictures or participate in pornographic videos”. The company is also accused
of fostering unmoderated user groups devoted to facilitating and selling child
sexual exploitation content.

Profiteering has played a significant role in boosting inflation during 2022,
according to a report that calls for a global corporation tax to curb excess
profits.

Analysis of the financial accounts of many of the UK’s biggest businesses
found that profits far outpaced increases in costs, helping to push up
inflation last year to levels not seen since the early 1980s.

ExxonMobil: profits of £15bn increased to £53bn

Shell: £16bn up to £44bn

Glencore: £1.9 bn up to £14.8bn

Archer-Daniels-Midland: £1.4bn up to £3.16bn

Wall Street’s most powerful banking executives warned Congress that new

On the eve of an election year, with the threat of recession looming large,
the bosses of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and five other large
firms urged policymakers to “be thoughtful” about the impact of the rules.

  * Sellafield nuclear site hacked by groups linked to Russia and China
  * Sellafield workers claim ‘toxic culture’ could put safety at risk

Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation, has uncovered problems with
cyber hacking, radioactive leaks and toxic workplace culture at Sellafield,
the UK’s most hazardous nuclear site.

It has also revealed how a small corner of the UK has an outsized influence on
its special relationship with the US, with the countries bound by the shared
history of nuclear weapons development. Britain’s neighbours in Europe,
particularly Norway and Ireland, also keep a sharp eye on the site, from where
previous pollution incidents and radioactivity as a result of a fire have made
it to their shores.

AI and machine learning have been used by financial firms for at least a
decade, for example, to help detect fraud and money laundering. However, a
recent increase in technological advances and available data, as well as
falling costs of computing power, had fuelled “considerable interest” and more
widespread use across the sector, the Bank’s financial policy committee (FPC)
said.

            <p>Rating agency says Beijing may need to bail out local governments as property

the property sector would undermine efforts to revive its flagging economy.

Moody’s warned that Beijing would need to bail out local and regional
governments and state-owned enterprises that were struggling with rising
debts, hampering efforts to boost investment and growth.

behavior. It’s counterproductive for everyone involved

It’s lunchtime on a rainy Saturday at Westfield Garden State Plaza, New
Jersey’s oldest and second-largest **** shopping mall. The food court is
packed, with families in booths, clusters of teens at high-tops, and a long
line at Chick-fil-A where Gael, Odell and Katie, teenagers from over the
border in New York state, have just bought their food.

Their local mall hosts mostly small businesses, so when Katie had an eye
appointment nearby the rest were happy to tag along and check out all the
Garden state has to offer. “Aritzia, Pink, I really like the Body Shop,” Katie

figurines, from a favorite anime, Jujutsu Kaisen.

Taiwan’s Foxconn and Pegatron have halted production of Apple iPhones at their
factories near Chennai in southern India because of heavy rains, sources close
to the matter said on Monday.

In Tamil Nadu’s capital Chennai, the state’s largest city and a major
electronics and manufacturing hub, at least two people died and the runway of
one of the country’s busiest airports was submerged after torrential rain as
the city braced for a severe cyclone expected to hit in the next 24 hours. Two
others had died elsewhere. Cyclone Michaung was expected to make landfall on
the coast of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh around noon on
Tuesday, the country’s weather office said, with sustained winds of 90kph to
100kph (56mph to 62mph), gusting to 110kph.

            <p>Experts advise the city’s first AAPI female bookstore owner on a plan to
reopen Yu &amp; Me Books in its original location in Chinatown

For Lucy Yu, who runs what’s believed to be New York City’s first Asian

            <p>High-income Americans also almost as likely to defer healthcare over cost as
people with low or average incomes in other countries

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
