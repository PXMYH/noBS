            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Social media firms have faced scrutiny from Congress over their impact on
young users, but parents who have lost kids to online harm are now leading the
charge

The night of 23 June 2020 passed by like any other for 16-year-old Carson
Bride. The teen had just gotten a new job at a pizza restaurant, his mother,
Kristin Bride, said, and the family had been celebrating at home in Lake
Oswego, Oregon. He wrote his future work schedule on the kitchen calendar
after dinner, said goodnight, and went to his room for bed. But the next
morning, Kristin says, the family woke to “complete shock and horror”: Carson
had died by suicide.

Kristin soon discovered that in the days leading up to his death, her son had
received hundreds of harassing messages on Yolo – a third-party app that at
the time was integrated into Snapchat and allowed users to communicate
anonymously. Search history on Carson’s phone revealed some of his final hours
online were spent desperately researching how to find who was behind the
harassment and how to put an end to it.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>From the generic hipster cafe to the ‘Instagram wall’, the internet has pushed
us towards a kind of global ubiquity – and this phenomenon is only going to
intensify

For most of the 2010s, I was a religious user of Yelp, an app for finding and
reviewing restaurants and other local businesses. The red-and-white interface
became a trusted source of recommendations when at home in New York or abroad.
In Berlin, Kyoto and Reykjavík, I searched for coffee shops, and quickly
scrolled through Yelp’s list, which was sorted by the cafes’ star rating – a
reflection of how much the app’s other users had liked each spot.

I often typed “hipster coffee shop” into the search bar as a shorthand because
Yelp’s search algorithm always knew exactly what I meant by the phrase. It was
the kind of cafe that someone like me – a western, twentysomething (at the
time), internet-brained millennial acutely conscious of their own taste –
would want to go to. Inevitably, I could quickly identify a cafe among the
search results that had the requisite qualities: plentiful daylight through
large storefront windows; industrial-size wood tables for accessible seating;
a bright interior with walls painted white or covered in subway tiles; and
wifi available for writing or procrastinating. Of course, the actual coffee
mattered, too, and at these cafes you could be assured of getting a cappuccino
made from fashionably light-roast espresso, your choice of milk variety and
elaborate latte art. The most committed among the cafes would offer a flat
white (a cappuccino variant that originated in Australia and New Zealand) and
avocado toast, a simple dish, also with Australian origins, that over the
2010s became synonymous with millennial consumer preferences. (Infamous
headlines blamed millennials’ predilection for expensive avocado toast for
their inability to buy real estate in gentrifying cities.)

The root of the climate crisis is “not capitalism but the corruption of
capitalism”, according to the author of a new book on how people, policy and
technology are working to stop the planet from heating.

Akshat Rathi, a climate reporter with financial news outlet Bloomberg, argues
that smart policies can harness capitalism to cut carbon pollution without
killing markets or competition. “It is now cheaper to save the world than
destroy it,” he writes, adding that this holds true even when viewed through a
narrow capitalist lens.

Aviation is an abundant source of metaphors, but not always as self-generating
as the terrifying Alaska Airlines incident that has once again brought Boeing
low: a hole blown in the side of an ascending plane, a gap that was not
properly plugged, passengers staring into the void.

The safe landing of flight 1282 on 5 January after a boy literally lost the
shirt from his back as the air was sucked out at 14,000 feet, means Boeing can

Administration investigation and a further audit announced this week and a

Kazakhstan’s national airline has announced plans to float on the London stock
market, bringing a potential windfall to BAE Systems, which has been an
investor for more than two decades.

Air Astana, which is 49% owned by the British defence company, hopes to list
in London and Kazakhstan and raise $120m (£94m). The airline, which is
majority owned by the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund, did not say how much of
the company would be floated and is yet to confirm an expected valuation
range.

            <p>Maria Burns Oritz develops software for Indigenous communities – now she she
wants to democratize game development

Long before trumpeting the need to pair profit with progressive philosophies
became a cornerstone of corporate America, Maria Burns Oritz believed in
building the type of businesses that will do well and do good. Even before its
official inception in 2015, her Minneapolis-based gaming company 7 Generation
Games was a side hustle focused on developing software and gaming platforms
that served the needs of underrepresented populations.

“We want to help close the education gap,” says 41-year-old Burns Oritz, who
co-founded the company with her mother, tech veteran and judo champion
AnnMaria Waddell (Burns Ortiz’s sister is wrestler, Olympian and video game
aficionado Ronda Rousey). Many of the games from 7 Generation are made for
members of Native American tribes that live within the company’s surrounding
communities across the midwest. “We focus on more diverse voices and content
both because they are absent from so many curricula and because no one else on
the market was doing this,” says Burns Ortiz.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
