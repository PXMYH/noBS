            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Platform suspended the US president’s YouTube channel in 2021 after the
January 6 Capitol riot

YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5m to settle a suit brought by Donald Trump in
2021 that alleged the platform wrongly suspended his channel after the January
6 attack on the US Capitol. The Google subsidiary is the latest in a long
string of tech companies to make a multimillion-dollar payout to the president
over past decisions about his accounts.

Trump had filed the suit against YouTube and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai,
alleging that the platform had “accumulated an unprecedented concentration of
power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse”.
YouTube said it suspended Trump’s channel because it had violated the
website’s policies against inciting violence. Because of the settlement, the
case is now dismissed. Google did not immediately return a request for
comment.

Zink &amp; Sons has made bespoke suits on Sydney’s Oxford Street for 130 years.
For most of that time, the family-owned men’s tailoring business has resided
at number 56, halfway between Hyde Park and the street’s LGBTQI heart at
Taylor Square. Today its director, Daniel Jones, is looking for a new base
after a rent increase he says is unaffordable.

His shop is located in a development project that has been almost six years in
the making. Oxford and Foley, a commercial strip of renovated heritage
buildings, has been touted as key to revitalising the storied and colourful
street, bringing new retail, hospitality and creative spaces, upmarket tenants
and an injection of fresh energy. Three weeks ago, Golf Wang, the much-hyped

Donald Trump has a lot of questions about the official government statistics
these days. And while his skepticism of bad numbers may look cynical and
political, there are reasons to look at the numbers cautiously.

According to some reports, staffing shortages “have forced the US federal
government to scale back the price checks it uses to calculate the inflation
rate” with the labor department reportedly admitting that it had to “cut back”
on its price checking nationwide and even suspend its surveys in some cities
due to manpower shortages.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
