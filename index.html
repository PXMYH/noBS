BP has formally dismissed its chief executive Bernard Looney with immediate

“serious misconduct” relating to his past relationships with colleagues.

Looney stepped down from his post in September after admitting he had failed
to fully disclose a series of personal relationships with his colleagues to
the board.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The streaming platform has shared its most in-depth look at what their many
subscribers have been watching

In news that will excite anyone who spent a substantial chunk of their youth
poring over the purple “Life” section of USA Today for Nielsen ratings and box
office reports, Netflix has released a large chunk of its often-secret
viewership data. The streaming service has long displayed shifting top 10
lists on its homepage, showing what’s currently most watched among their film
and TV offerings. But this new data dump is an 18,000-row spreadsheet
cataloging data for just about any movie or TV show over the course of January
through June of this year.

So what, exactly, are the biggest shows and movies on Netflix? Many of the
most popular shows feature or are aimed at young women. Anyone with access to
social media or a Hot Topic will probably know that Wednesday, the service’s
Addams Family-as-YA reboot, is a huge success; less merchandised but similarly
high up the Netflix charts are Ginny &amp; Georgia (essentially Netflix’s in-house
Gilmore Girls), Outer Banks (a teen mystery series), Firefly Lane (a decades-
spanning drama of female friendship), and the Korean drama series Crash Course
in Romance. There’s also plenty of escapist action-adventure fare, like FUBAR
(a father-daughter action-comedy with Arnold Schwarzenegger that plays a bit
like a True Lies sequel) and the limited series Kaleidoscope (a time-scrambled
heist drama whose episodes can be watched in any order); plus more serious
action-intrigue like The Night Agent (the most-watched Netflix Thing for this
entire six-month period) and The Diplomat (with Keri Russell as a newly
appointed US ambassador).

Tesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted with its
Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new safeguards, after a
safety regulator said the system was open to “foreseeable misuse”.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been
investigating the electric automaker led by the billionaire Elon Musk for more
than two years over whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay
attention when using the driver assistance system.

Urgent action is needed to prevent record debt repayments by the world’s
poorest countries developing into a full-blown crisis, the World Bank has
warned.

The Washington-based multilateral body said the escalating cost of servicing
past borrowing caused by rising interest rates was siphoning money away from
spending on health, education and tackling the climate crisis.

            <p>More than 2 million clients used tooth-straightening service that advertised
itself as faster and cheaper than braces

Audrey Ganus was running late for her SmileDirectClub appointment on Monday,
so she called from the car to let a receptionist know that she might show up
five minutes past her appointment time. When she heard an automated voicemail
say that the company had shut down and was no longer offering services, she
assumed the phone number had changed – she’d received a confirmation email
just two days beforehand. But when she arrived at the office, she saw the
doors were locked, the lights were off, and items were “scattered everywhere”
inside, as if workers had left in a hurry.

Things got worse when Ganus, who is 22 and lives in Palm Harbor, Florida,
tried to log on to her patient portal. “I was supposed to have records of
everything: my retainers, 3D scans of my teeth, progress reports,” Ganus said.
“There’s nothing. Now I don’t even have any proof that I’ve ever had my smile
straightened. No other doctor is willing to help me without that proof, so the
only way I can get help is if I start all over again, and have my teeth
straightened for three, four or five thousand dollars. SmileDirectClub left me
with no options, and I’m freaking out a bit.”

Police and national security bodies in the EU will be banned from using real-

without having judicial authorisation, it has emerged.

The measure was part of a historic agreement reached between the European
parliament and EU member states on Friday after three days of negotiations.

Russia’s farmers are achieving record grain harvests – according to official
figures. But the numbers published by Vladimir Putin’s government appear to
conceal the contribution to this bumper crop made by another set of farmers:
those in occupied Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials and agriculture experts have claimed that favourable
conditions are not enough to explain the giant harvest. They say instead that
Ukrainian grain is being exported disguised as Russian produce.

            <p>Experts advise the city’s first AAPI female bookstore owner on a plan to
reopen Yu &amp; Me Books in its original location in Chinatown

For Lucy Yu, who runs what’s believed to be New York City’s first Asian
American woman-owned bookstore, losing her brick-and-mortar business was akin
to losing a child. But since 4 July of this year, when a blaze engulfed the
Chinatown building that housed Yu &amp; Me Books, the 29-year-old has had little
time to process her grief.

Within hours of the blaze, she shifted into rebuild mode: right after
firefighters brought the fire under control, Yu and a friend ran into the
store and hauled inventory into plastic bags and tarps. They salvaged a couple
thousand books from the wreckage, just under half of the collection. The
effort left Yu coughing and short of breath for the next two weeks.

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.
