been involved. The investigation also found the electric carmaker’s claims did
not match up with reality.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) disclosed on Friday
that during its three-year Autopilot safety investigation, which it launched
in August 2021, it identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving one or more

Google’s parent company has hit a stock market value of $2tn (£1.6tn) as
investors reacted to a declaration of its first ever dividend alongside strong
results on Thursday.

Shares in Alphabet rose 10% in early Wall Street trading on Friday to give the
tech group a stock market capitalisation – a measure of a corporation’s value

Ryanair has demanded that the EU reform its skies after the airline was forced
to cancel more than 300 flights across Europe scheduled for Thursday because
of a strike by French air traffic controllers.

The cancellations come in spite of the withdrawal of strike action by one of
the biggest unions, the SNCTA, which came too late to avoid disruption after
France’s civil aviation authority asked airlines to cut flights.

Fewer than 60 multinationals are responsible for more than half of the world’s
plastic pollution, with six responsible for a quarter of that, based on the
findings of a piece of research published on Wednesday.

The researchers concluded that for every percentage increase in plastic
produced, there was an equivalent increase in plastic pollution in the
environment.

When Marisa Fernández lost her husband to cancer a few years ago, her
employers at the Eroski hypermarket went, she says, “above and beyond to help
me through the dark days afterwards, rejigging my timetable and giving me time
off when I couldn’t face coming in.”

She had a chance to return the favour recently when the store, in Arrasate-
Mondragón in Spain’s Basque Country, was undergoing renovations. Fernández,
58, who started on the cashier desk 34 years ago, and now manages the store’s
non-food section, volunteered to work extra shifts over the weekend along with
her colleagues to ensure everything was ready for Monday morning. “It’s not
just me. Everyone is ready to go the extra mile,” she says.

Australia’s inflation rate slowed less than expected in the March quarter as
rents and education costs increased, dimming hopes the cost-of-living crunch
was easing and lessening chances of a 2024 cut in official interest rates.

The consumer price index for the first three months of 2024 was 3.6% higher
than a year earlier, slowing from the 4.1% annual pace in the December
quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had
tipped CPI growth would drop to 3.5%.

and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
