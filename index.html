  *  **European markets rise and euro gains against dollar amid ‘Trumpcession’ fears**
  * Global stock markets register heavy falls as White House tries to talk up Trump tariffs

 **Swiss bank UBS has warned there is an increased risk that the US economy
suffers a downturn, hitting stock markets.**

 **UBS** has updated its House View scenario, and now sees a 30% chance of a
“stagflationary or cyclical downturn” in the US, up from 25% at the end of
last month.

“In our base case, to which we attach a 50% probability, US economic growth is
likely to moderate compared with last year but remain positive.

While we treat the economic data and the words of the Trump administration

protracted slowdown in the US economy in hope of better growth or economic
dynamics in the medium to long term would require a shift from an approach
which has so far focused on achieving quick success.”

  * Business live – latest updates

and the threat of more levies against European trading partners, have
triggered fears of an American recession.

The US labor market continued to grow in February even as threats of mass
layoffs in the federal government and uncertainty around Donald Trump’s tariff
policies rattle the US economy.

In February, 151,000 jobs were added to the economy, up from an adjusted
125,000 jobs gained in January. The unemployment rate was 4.1%, little changed
from 4% in January. Economists had been expecting 170,000 new jobs to be added
over the month.

It is easy to believe that Elon Musk’s reach knows no limits. But while the

there is one market that Musk has yet to properly crack: India.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.
