            <p>Escalation of Israel-Hamas war into Middle East-wide conflict would disrupt
oil supplies and stoke food prices, says Bank

Oil prices could soar to a record high of more than $150 a barrel if the war
between Israel and Hamas leads to a repeat of the full-scale conflict in the
Middle East witnessed 50 years ago, the World Bank has warned.

In the first major assessment of the economic risks of an escalation of the
war beyond Gaza’s borders, the World Bank said there was a risk of the cost of
crude entering “uncharted waters”.

A “small disruption” scenario, in which the global oil supply would be reduced
by 500,000 to 2m barrels a day -roughly equivalent to the reduction seen
during the Libyan civil war in 2011. The oil price would rise to a range of
$93 to $102 a barrel.

A “medium disruption” scenario – roughly equivalent to the Iraq war in 2003 –
where the global oil supply would be reduced by 3m to 5m barrels a day. Oil
prices would rise by 21% to 35% initially, taking them to between $109 and
$121 a barrel.

A “large disruption” scenario-comparable to the action taken during the Yom
Kippur war of 1973 – in which the global oil supply would shrink by 6m to 8m
barrels a day, resulting in a 56% to 75% increase in prices to between $140
and $157 a barrel.

value increase from start of Israel-Hamas conflict

  * This article is co-published with Responsible Statecraft

The United Nations has warned that there was “clear evidence” that war crimes
may have been committed in “the explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza”.
Meanwhile, Wall Street is hoping for an explosion in profits.

During third-quarter earnings calls this month, analysts from Morgan Stanley
and TD Bank took note of this potential profit-making escalation in conflict
and asked unusually blunt questions about the financial benefit of the war
between Israel and Hamas.

Qantas has claimed it doesn’t sell customers tickets to any particular flight,
but rather a “bundle of rights” that includes alternative options in the event
of cancellations, as it responds to allegations it sold tickets to thousands
of already cancelled flights.

The embattled airline revealed its view as it filed its legal defence
responding to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC)
legal action alleging it had advertised and sold tickets for more than 8,000
flights that it had already cancelled in its internal system.

The recent rise in interest rates has been blamed for ending Britain’s wealth
boom and causing total household wealth to plunge by a quarter since the
Covid-19 pandemic.

A report by the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank, and Financial Fairness
Trust – an independent charity historically funded by Standard Life now known
as abrdn – said the fall was due to a drop in house prices and pension pots,
which account for about £4 out of every £5 of total wealth, and played a
leading role in rising wealth across the country over the 40 years leading up
to the pandemic.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) reached a tentative labor deal with Chrysler
owner Stellantis on Saturday, two sources said, moving closer to securing
record wage hikes and a new life for a Jeep factory shut down earlier this
year.

The tentative deal is a big step towards ending the first simultaneous strike
against the so-called “Detroit Three” automakers, and will follow a template
set just days ago by UAW and Ford, including a 25% wage hike over the
4.5-year-long contract.

In a scene that could have been pulled from a Hollywood courtroom thriller,
Donald Trump was called to the witness box last week and accused of
threatening a clerk of the court.

The former president had already been fined for attacking the judge’s clerk.
Now he had done it again and the usually jocular Judge Arthur Engoron angrily

A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies singles out which 100

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.
