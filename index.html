            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk held a warm, but glitch-delayed conversation on X
that saw the tech mogul pitch a role for himself should the Republican nominee
win a second White House term, but otherwise rehashed the notes that Trump
routinely strikes at his campaign rallies. The billionaire entrepreneur blamed
the delay on a cyber attack, without providing any evidence. As many as 1.3
million listeners tuned in, according to X, formerly known as Twitter.
Meanwhile, UK unemployment fell unexpectedly, falling 0.2 percentage points to
4.2% in the three months to June, according to Office for National Statistics.
Employment surged by 97,000, much stronger than the 3,000 increase that
forecasters had expected. Today&#39;s guests: Beata Manthey, Citigroup Global

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>US economy has staying power but China’s growth prospects have worsened and
too little attention is paid to war in Gaza

Back in the 1930s, the French government constructed what it thought was an
impregnable defence system to prevent a repeat of the German invasion at the
start of the first world war. The Maginot Line might have looked impressive
but proved to be a white elephant because when the attack came in 1940 it was
in a different place altogether.

In the past week the financial markets have displayed something of a Maginot
Line mentality. They are right to think there is a threat lurking out there
but they are wrong to think the biggest danger is a recession in the US. The
real threat comes from elsewhere.

            <p>There are signs the billionaire is becoming unpopular with the very

Black Americans strongly support initiatives that would increase the minimum
wage to $17, make affordable housing more accessible and create an equitable
tax system, according to Black to the Future Action Fund, a political advocacy
thinktank. On Thursday, the group released a 55-page economic agenda based on
its 2023 survey of 211,219 Black people across all 50 states. The organization
hopes that the report will serve as a roadmap for elected officials to address
policy holes, and for advocates to generate campaigns that hold politicians
accountable.

“We have to start imagining what it is that we want and not be so afraid to
break out of what is,” said Alicia Garza, founder and former principal of
Black to the Future Action Fund, at a Thursday symposium in Atlanta.

After years of flexibility that workers could have only dreamed of before the
pandemic, employers are now eager for staff to return to the office – for at
least part of the week.

Business groups and CBD cafe owners have reacted gleefully to bosses calling
their employees back in. But workers and unions are reluctant to give up
freedoms, suggesting some level of flexibility will remain the norm for most
office-based professionals for years to come.

JD Vance’s investments reveal potential contradictions between the political
persona he has sought to project, his history as a venture capitalist and
Peter Thiel acolyte, and his status as a hard-edged tribune of the so-called
“new right”.

Companies he has invested in include a firm that carries out medical testing
of therapies that may include stem cells in scientific research to tech firms
with records of harvesting data. Vance and some of the people behind the
various firms he is involved with also exhibit an obsession with references to
the mythology around The Lord of the Rings’ fantasy world.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The rise of artificial intelligence has sparked a panic about computers
gaining power over humankind. But the real threat comes from falling for the
hype

In Arthur C Clarke’s short story The Nine Billion Names of God, a sect of
monks in Tibet believes humanity has a divinely inspired purpose: inscribing
all the various names of God. Once the list was complete, they thought, he
would bring the universe to an end. Having worked at it by hand for centuries,
the monks decide to employ some modern technology. Two sceptical engineers
arrive in the Himalayas, powerful computers in tow. Instead of 15,000 years to
write out all the permutations of God’s name, the job gets done in three
months. As the engineers ride ponies down the mountainside, Clarke’s tale ends
with one of literature’s most economical final lines: “Overhead, without any
fuss, the stars were going out.”

It is an image of the computer as a shortcut to objectivity or ultimate
meaning – which also happens to be, at least part of, what now animates the
fascination with artificial intelligence. Though the technologies that
underpin AI have existed for some time, it’s only since late 2022, with the
emergence of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, that the technology that approached
intelligence appeared to be much closer. In a 2023 report by Microsoft Canada,
president Chris Barry proclaimed that “the era of AI is here, ushering in a
transformative wave with potential to touch every facet of our lives”, and
that “it is not just a technological advancement; it is a societal shift”.
That is among the more level-headed reactions. Artists and writers are
panicking that they will be made obsolete, governments are scrambling to catch
up and regulate, and academics are debating furiously.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In the 1980s, a company called Superfest pioneered extra strong glass – but it
disappeared with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Now it’s making a comeback

The glass is narrow at the bottom but bulges out a third of the way to the
top. As with the classic British “nonik” pint, the bulge makes the glass
easier to stack and gives your thumb and index finger somewhere to rest. The
name is spelled in fading letters near the rim and means “super tight” or
“super strong” in German, which one might assume to be a reference to the
drinker’s solid grip. In fact, it hails the glass’s extraordinary durability.

This is Superfest, East Germany’s “unbreakable” drinking glass. Invented in
the industry-rich but resource-poor socialist German Democratic Republic,
Superfest glasses were designed with the aim of making them last five times
longer than ordinary drinking glasses. They were soon found to be 10 times
more durable.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
