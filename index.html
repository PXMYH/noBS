            <p>Experts say top chief executives are treading a fine line to avoid any
backlash in the event of a Trump victory

After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, America’s business leaders came
out strongly in their criticism of Donald Trump. Now – as the Harris campaign
brands Trump a “fascist” and Trump threatens retribution against “the enemy
from within” – there appears to be a conspiracy of silence.

  * US elections 2024 – live updates

Most gamblers might want to sit out the US election. It’s too close to call
with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck, according to official
polls. But the former president’s campaign has latched on to signs he says
prove he’s actually “leading”.

In a close race, Trump and his allies claim some “gambling polls”, as he
described them last week, put him significantly ahead of Harris. “Like, 65 to
35, or something like that.”

The pace of US economic growth slowed over the summer but continued its two-
year expansion, according to data released on Wednesday, days before millions
of voters decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is best placed to lead
it forward.

US gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of economic health – rose by
2.8% in the third quarter, short of economists’ expectations of 3.1%, and down
from the previous quarter’s 3% reading. The increase was driven primarily by
consumer spending, exports and federal government spending.

  * US elections 2024 – live updates

If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out “the largest deportation operation
in American history”. After pushback on Joe Biden’s border policies, Kamala
Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on
asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US

US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic
rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country

trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure.

pay, raising the prospect of an extended battle with unions representing
120,000 German employees.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
