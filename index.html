They’re Ivy-League educated, brilliant academic minds and experienced in the
ways of markets, governments, data and statistics. Many have access to
information not readily available to the general public. They attend meetings,
forums and conferences with each other. They write books, review papers and
oversee research. They are our nation’s top economists. And they oftentimes
get it wrong. Very wrong.

Both the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and Fed chairman, Jerome Powell,
were wrong about inflation, having first called rising prices “transitory”
after Covid disrupted the entire world’s supply chain. Nobel winner Paul
Krugman publicly admitted his mistakes. They were not alone.

It has been an explosive weekend for Elon Musk. The American billionaire has
had to witness not only the public “rapid unscheduled disassembly” of another
of his rockets, but also watch while a group of well-known global companies,
including Apple, Disney and IBM, pulled advertising from X, his social media
platform.

The businesses, all of them household names, made the decision to stop
spending on the site, formerly known as Twitter, after the American
billionaire’s public support for an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Last
Wednesday, Musk replied to a conspiracy post which accused Jews of promoting
hatred of white people, noting that it was the “actual truth”. He has since
argued that his intended criticism was of specific campaign groups, such as
the campaign group the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and was not aimed at the
wider Jewish community.

hub in China’s global infrastructure project, the belt and road initiative.

With a financial centre, beach-front villas and an international yacht marina,
the city is aiming to be a rival to Dubai and Singapore. China has already
invested $1.4bn in the development, which is due to be completed by 2041.

            <p>Trial judge Arthur Engoron had imposed gag order last month after the former
president maligned a court clerk

A New York appeals court judge on Thursday paused a gag order that barred
Donald Trump from commenting on court staffers in his civil fraud trial. The
trial judge had imposed the gag order last month and later fined Trump $15,000
for violations after the former president made a disparaging social media post
about a court clerk.

In his decision, Judge David Friedman of the state’s intermediate appeals
court cited constitutional concerns about restricting Trump’s free speech. He
issued a stay of the gag order, allowing Trump to comment freely about court
staff while a longer appeals process plays out.

Meta called on US lawmakers on Wednesday to regulate Google and Apple’s app
stores to better protect children, the same day that the Senate began
investigating Meta’s failures to shield children using its platforms.

In a blogpost titled Parenting in a Digital World Is Hard. Congress Can Make
It Easier, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global head of safety, called for federal
legislation that would mandate app stores to notify parents whenever a child
between the age of 13 and 16 downloads an app, and would solicit the parents’
approval. Children under 13 are already prohibited from creating accounts and
downloading apps without a parent’s go-ahead.

If the US is “going to save the middle class” then Democrats and Republicans

told the Guardian this week ahead of a Senate hearing on the benefits of
unions.

Sanders is holding a Senate health, education, labor and pensions committee
hearing on Tuesday with US labor leaders on the state of the US labor movement
and efforts to rein in corporate greed in America.

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
