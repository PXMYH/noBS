            <p>Multiple indicators – from GDP growth to the unemployment rate (and even
inflation) – point to a robust US economic engine

The Republican primaries are under way and – not surprisingly – the candidates
have been ganging up on Bidenomics. Spoiler alert: they don’t like it. Fact
check: they are wrong.

To a man – and one woman – the Republican candidates all say that the US
economy is bad and that Americans are struggling financially. They’re warning
about sky-high deficits, over-the-top government spending and a potentially
catastrophic level of national debt. They point out that interest rates are at
a 20-year high and the costs of core things like food, gas and housing are
significantly more than they were just a few years ago. They point to a
downturn in manufacturing and falling small business confidence.

As a plumbing tycoon, Patrick Racz was used to enduring a deluge. But
circumstances led to a very different kind of drenching, sitting in his local
park in the rain contemplating the demise of his business during the dotcom
crash. “I lost everything. I had young children. I was embarrassed, upset that
I’d let my family down. I couldn’t look them in the face,” he recalls.

His nadir came just before the emergence of a patent battle with Apple that
would define his life. Nearly two decades on, he remains at loggerheads with
the company and the US courts.

• Read a short extract from Limitarianism by Ingrid Robeyns

Here’s a couple of good questions for an election year: while we may talk
about minimum wages, why don’t we ever discuss maximum wages? And, while our
politicians may argue about how little a family can survive on, why do they
never address the other end of the inequality scale: just how much accumulated
wealth might be too much?

This week in January is always a pertinent one for such questions. As the
world’s billionaires have private-jetted out to Davos to slap themselves on
the back once again for their outrageous fortune, Oxfam has produced its
annual report about the growing gap between that happy few and the other 8
billion from whom they profit and with whom they share the planet’s resources.
This year’s report, _Inequality Inc_ , again articulates a trend that we have
all witnessed for the past four decades and more. While most people, locally,
nationally, globally, try to survive on the same or less, the rich and the
very rich become phenomenally more wealthy year by year. Since 2020, the
report reveals, “60% of humanity has grown poorer, [while] billionaires are
now $3.3tn or 34% richer than they were at the beginning of this decade of
crisis.” The wealth of the world’s five richest men has more than doubled in
that period, adding an unprecedented $464bn to their fortunes.

Law enforcement agencies are on the hunt for a man accused of stealing
millions from property market investors as police warn Australians to be on
guard against “pig butchering” scams before Valentine’s Day.

A Victorian man is alleged to have fleeced wannabe property market investors
of $8.7m by claiming to be a developer who offers to help people demolish
their homes and build townhouses in their place.

            <p>Even as more job cuts await, some analysts see the beginnings of a bull market
in the coming season of earnings reports

Will 2024 be a boom or a bust for big tech? By one estimate, there have been
more than 7,500 layoffs in the sector since the start of the year – a
dispersal of pink slips that many hoped would have ceased after the deep job
cuts of 2023.

However, as the US’s big tech earnings season gets under way this week, some
analysts are predicting strong numbers. This batch of quarterly financial
results may show that the industry has cleared out its pandemic-era overhiring
and reorganised itself around cloud computing and AI - necessitating cuts in
sectors with less rosy prospects. Analysts keen on AI say we are at the start
of a tech bull market.

Early adopters remember that heady time. Introduction by _Merritt K_

Today it is trivially easy to play games on a computer, games console or phone
with your friends over the internet. But before the wide availability of high-
speed internet, things were more complicated.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, 3D graphics in video games were becoming more
and more complex, but the low network speeds of the period meant that these
games, unlike slower-paced and less graphically intensive strategy games, were
nearly unplayable over an internet connection. In this moment, in which
communications technology was being outpaced by graphical power, the Lan
(local area network) party was born.

            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Shoes are notoriously hard to recycle and the vast majority are sent to
landfill. Can a new design help reduce the environmental impact of our
footwear?

The shoes may not immediately strike you as the future of mainstream fashion.
Pale and porous, they resemble a cross between a beige Croc and the long-net
stinkhorn fungus found on forest floors. Their creators, however, hope this
will be the next huge breakthrough in sustainable footwear: the world’s first
3D printed, made-to-measure, compostable shoe, which can be broken down at the
end of its life, in an attempt to stem the flow of millions of shoes into
landfill each year.

Fashion is among the world’s top polluting industries. It is responsible for
about 10% of global carbon emissions and consumes huge amounts of water and
land for production. Modern shoes are among the hardest items to produce
sustainably because of their complexity, say industry experts, and there are
few reliable statistics about the number manufactured every year for the
world’s 8 billion humans. There is an almost total dearth of statistics about
their environmental impact.

The move follows a backlash after the Guardian reported the initial 28-man

Climate campaign group. “Climate change affects the whole world, not half of

Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of taking an irresponsible approach to

par with human levels of intelligence. The Facebook founder has also raised
the prospect of making it freely available to the public.

The Meta chief executive has said the company will attempt to build an
artificial general intelligence (AGI) system and make it open source, meaning
it will be accessible to developers outside the company. The system should be
made “as widely available as we responsibly can”, he added.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday grilled Coinbase and the US
securities regulator about their divergent views on whether and when digital
assets are securities, in a case closely watched by the cryptocurrency
industry.

Coinbase argued against classifying cryptocurrencies as securities by saying

at the loss-making plant in south Wales while it completed a four-year
transition plan to greener production.
