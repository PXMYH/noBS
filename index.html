            <p>Paris-based think tank upgrades UK’s growth forecast for this year

  * UK economy to grow faster than Japan, Italy and Germany this year, says OECD

 **Back to Rightmove’s rejection of the third takeover offer from Rupert
Murdoch’s REA Group, worth £6.1bn, as too low.**

 **Susannah Streeter** , head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown,
said:

Rightmove is playing hard to get and **Rupert Murdoch** ’s REA Group is going
to have to up its game again if it has a chance of winning over the board to
accept a takeover offer. The bids so far have been rejected out of hand, and
even the improved latest offer is considered to materially undervalue the
company and its future prospects.

With the UK government pledging to build 1.5m new homes, interest rate cuts
eyed and the property market springing into life again, Rightmove clearly sees
significant growth opportunities ahead.

It’s hard to see why 759p is a good enough offer to ignore that potential plus
the business’ growth prospects thereon out. On top of which, the structure of
the offer is overly complicated – with 55% of it in scrip, which we expect
many funds would choose to sell in the event of a deal, thereby complicating
the realisation of value by investors.

As a result, we continue to see a low likelihood that a successful deal can be
closed, in the absence of some creativity on REA’s part to increase its bid.

great columns of air across the room.

“Datacentres are the lungs of digital life,” says Amet Novillo, the managing

            <p>Ex-Alameda CEO and ex-girlfriend of fallen crypto mogul pleaded guilty, but
prosecutors requested lenient sentence

Caroline Ellison, the former crypto executive and romantic partner of the
disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 24 months in prison
**** in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. Ellison was a central figure in
the FTX bankruptcy saga and key witness for the prosecution in the $8bn fraud
trial that ended with Bankman-Fried’s conviction.

Ellison served as the chief executive of Alameda Research, which was the
trading arm of the now defunct FTX crypto exchange. The collapse of FTX, once
valued at $32bn, was directly linked to revelations that it was attempting to
financially prop up Alameda with fraudulent accounting. Subsequent
investigations and criminal charges found that FTX and the hedge fund had used
billions in customer funds for risky trades and lavish personal spending.

consumers a ‘virtual pot’ to support its suppliers

When she was a child growing up in Kenya, Margaret Nyamumbo learned about a

pot. Anyone who had contributed had the right to later retrieve funds in the
form of a small loan.

This so-called “table banking” system, which is a custom in Kenya, helped
women involved in the coffee trade support one another. Kenyan women, who

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
