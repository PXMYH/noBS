            <p>After her former label sold her catalogue in 2019, Swift embarked on her
lucrative album rerecording project – but now owns the originals for the first
time

Taylor Swift has bought back the master recordings to her first six albums,
giving her control over her entire catalogue for the first time. “I almost
stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot
dangled and then yanked away,” she wrote in a letter to fans. “But that’s all
in the past now. All of the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.”

She originally lost the rights in 2019 when her first record label, Big
Machine, sold them to music executive Scooter Braun. Swift described the sale
to Braun as her “worst case scenario”, and said she had not been given the
opportunity to buy her work outright, but to “earn” one album back for each
new album she recorded for the label. Her subsequent albums, from 2019’s Lover
onwards, were released on Republic, with Swift retaining the rights to the
master recordings.

gunfights have erupted in the Andean region of Pataz as the mines’ riches draw

Deep in the mountains of northern Peru, a bloody war is being fought over

stretch for miles inside the mountains of Pataz, a gold-rich Andean province
about 130 miles (200km) inland from Peru’s third city, Trujillo. In early May,

miner linked to the province’s largest mining company, Poderosa.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
