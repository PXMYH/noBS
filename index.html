 **UK trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds has also called for reforms of the
WTO, including changes to the much criticised dispute resolutions system which
can also take years to settle disputes between trading nations.**

 **Reynolds** told the **European** **Policy** **Centre** security conference
in Brussels:

“We do recognise that reforming and repositioning the WTO so that it can
respond more effectively to the challenges of today is the only way to
safeguard long term stability and growth tomorrow.

“Our eyes are fixed on greater flexibility in decision making, greater
openness in the east of plurilaterals and building a fully functioning dispute
settlement system,”

“the trees that survive the storms aren’t the tallest. They’re the ones whose
roots are intertwined with their lives.

“Just in the past two days, during the OECD trade ministerial [summit] the
message was clear and unequivocal – deep reform of the World Trade
Organisation is long overdue and urgently needed to match today’s realities.”

“We negotiate. We do not isolate. We do not leave the table… trade agreements
are more than transactions. They are upgrades that empower our partners,
helping them grow with us and creating a cycle of shared prosperity.”

            <p>Fortunate timing and government hesitation allowed the Switch 2 to come out on
time, but the headache isn’t over

Nintendo fans across the US are breathing a sigh of relief as they tear apart
the boxes housing their new Nintendo Switch 2 video game consoles. On-again,
off-again trade tariffs implemented by Donald Trump, which precipitated pre-
order delays from Nintendo, made the 5June release date of the highly coveted
hardware feel more like a hope than a certainty. A potential price hike up
from $450 loomed over launch day, but would-be buyers’ fears did not come to
fruition.

Nintendo’s maneuvering around Trump’s tariffs isn’t over, though – far from
it. The Japanese console maker managed to luckily launch its device squarely
within a 90-day tariff pause issued by the president. If tariffs on countries
like India and Japan return to the levels proposed during Trump’s “Liberation
Day” speech at the start of April, however, experts say Nintendo will have to
limber up for yet another delicate trade policy dance.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Facebook and Instagram parent’s deal follows other big tech companies signing
agreements with power companies

Meta on Tuesday said it had struck an agreement to keep one nuclear reactor of
a US utility company in Illinois operating for 20 years.

Meta’s deal with Constellation Energy is the social networking company’s first
with a nuclear power plant. Other large tech companies are looking to secure
electricity as US power demand rises significantly in part due to the needs of
artificial intelligence and datacenters. Google has reached agreements to
supply its datacenters with nuclear power via a half-dozen small reactors
built by a California utility company. Microsoft’s similar contract will
restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of the most serious
nuclear accident and radiation leak in US history.

            <p>Is artificial intelligence coming for everyone’s jobs? Not if this lot have
anything to do with it

The novelist Ewan Morrison was alarmed, though amused, to discover he had
written a book called Nine Inches Pleases a Lady. Intrigued by the limits of
generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had asked ChatGPT to give him the
names of the 12 novels he had written. “I’ve only written nine,” he says.
“Always eager to please, it decided to invent three.” The “nine inches” from
the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthy Robert Burns poem. “I
just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,” says Morrison. He is yet
to write Nine Inches – “or its sequel, Eighteen Inches”, he laughs. His actual
latest book, For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human
costs of technology.

Morrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and their
capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one
of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are
terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don’t
want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it’s a bit rubbish,
and more trouble than it’s worth; and those who simply prefer humans to
robots.

            <p>Morocco’s commercial centre has brought investment to the continent – but
critics say it masks domestic inequality

For centuries, Casablanca was a significant trading hub for merchants from
across the breadth of the Atlantic coast, given its geographical position
between Africa, the Middle East and Europe.

These days, Morocco’s economic capital is merging those historical roots with
a strong modern commercial identity. One such manifestation is the Casablanca
Finance City (CFC) district, whose high-rise buildings stand as a symbol of
the city’s dream of being a main gateway for international investment into
Africa.

The Fair Work Commission says a 3.5% above-inflation increase to the minimum
wage was necessary to avoid “entrenched” lower living standards among the
millions of Australia’s lowest-paid workers.

The president of the FWC, Justice Adam Hatcher, said the decision would help
claw back the loss of real incomes over the past few years, even as employer
groups warned many smaller businesses would struggle the afford the “generous”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
