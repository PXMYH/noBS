On a recent Friday night in San Jose, California, a small group of Spanish-
speaking renters sat in the clubhouse of their apartment complex wondering
whether the room was bugged. “Let them listen,” said a young man, with a
dismissive gesture.

They were meeting to strategize about forming a tenants’ association to
bargain collectively with their large corporate landlord. Along one wall of
the room hung large white posters with the names and unit numbers of residents
and their yes-or-no response to a survey about their willingness to
participate in a rent strike.

            <p>Service members are more likely than the general public to become problem

Dave Yeager didn’t join the US army to become a pathological gambler. But
after re-enlisting as a food inspection specialist in the wake of 9/11, Yeager
arrived at his base hotel in Seoul, Korea, feeling overwhelmed and restless.
“I’m walking around and find a casino-style slot machine room,” says the
57-year-old former sergeant. “As soon as I sat down, the first thing I noticed
was that my shoulders started to relax. Then I won, and it was like a dopamine
hit. In that moment, all of the fear and anger and stress that I was feeling
just went away.”

Suddenly and without warning, a night of gambling here and there became a
seven-day-a-week addiction – one that had him phoning home for more money,

            <p>**Exclusive:** Correspondence from pilots seen by Guardian Australia pleads
for changes to the roster system to address fatigue

Senior pilots at Virgin Australia have alleged fatigue is widespread in their
ranks and raised safety concerns about a roster system some claim is working
them “to the limits”.

Guardian Australia has obtained correspondence from senior pilots pleading for
action to address worker fatigue as Virgin Australia and the Transport Workers
Union (TWU) remain in a standoff over a proposal to strip pilots of six days’
annual leave during negotiations for a new enterprise agreement.

Multiple senior pilots say the rostering system used by Virgin is adding to
fatigue levels.

The system routinely schedules pilots to work maximum shift lengths – 11-12
hours and longer in the event of delays – on back-to-back days, while allowing
for just the legal minimum rest period of 12 hours.

Pilots have raised concerns with management about the roster software and
claim that the private equity owners of the airline, Bain Capital, have not
followed through on a promise to replace it.

Frustration at what they claim is management’s failure to recognise these
issues, or respond to staff warning of a resulting “clear, present and
increasing safety risk”.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in

He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
