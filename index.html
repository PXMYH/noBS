            <p>This year&#39;s stock rally, despite the persistent higher-for-longer interest
rate outlook, underscores the resilience of investor risk appetite. The S&amp;P
500 has continuously hit new highs even as Treasury yields and the dollar have
risen. This can be attributed to a robust U.S. economy, which is prompting
swaps markets to delay expectations for Fed easing, thereby driving yields and
the dollar up. This dynamic is favorable for equities. Meanwhile, the
Bloomberg Commodity Index has retreated from recent highs, but the volatility
in commodity prices carries long-term implications for economies and markets.

  * Do you know how US economy is actually doing? Try our interactive quiz

 _Less than six months before the US presidential election on 5 November_ _,
anxiety over the economy looms large. While official figures show a
significant recovery since the pandemic, many Americans aren’t buying it. As
election day approaches,_ _the Guardian is dispatching reporters to key swing
counties to gauge how they are feeling_ – _and how they might vote._

Rows of pecan and peach trees frame the scenery throughout Peach county,
Georgia, a rural area of central Georgia, about 100 miles south of Atlanta. A
field of yellow school buses pack a lot on the way into Fort Valley, the
county’s seat, where the buses used across the US are manufactured.

The United States is less than six months away from sending either Joe Biden
or Donald Trump back to the White House.

For many voters mulling this decision, the economy is front of mind. But how
it’s doing, and how it’s feeling, are not one and the same.

  * Do you know how US economy is actually doing? Try our interactive quiz

Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic
recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a
Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found
persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer.

The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy,
including:

55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a
recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product
(GDP), has been growing.

49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the
index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year.

49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment
rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low.

UK inflation fell to 2.3% in April – its lowest level for almost three years –

rate cut.

City analysts had forecast the annual increase in the cost of goods and

The clamour to secure tickets for Taylor Swift’s sold-out UK shows is expected
to fuel a summer fraud bonanza as figures showed a “staggering” £1.2bn was
stolen from unwitting consumers in 2023.

Swift’s Eras tour, which arrives in the UK in June, and the Olympic Games, are
contenders for biggest ticketing scam of the year. The warning, from industry
group UK Finance, came as its annual fraud report revealed that the number of
people succumbing to a “purchase scam” in 2023 soared.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
