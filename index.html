Starlink.

Musk has long been a critic of the Biden administration’s Broadband Equity,

sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions.

The rouble on Wednesday hit 110 against the dollar for the first time since 16
March 2022. Before launching its war on Ukraine in February 2022, the Russian
currency traded at around 75-80 against the US dollar.

Donald Trump set the business and political world alight late on Monday. The

Canada and hit China with more levies on day one of his term.

“This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular
Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” he wrote
on Truth Social.

Grocery prices have surged in recent years, rising by almost 27% since the
months before the pandemic. Workers inside grocery stores have been hit
particularly hard.

“We’re often the people down at the bottom of the food chain when it comes to
wages,” said Conor Watson, a meat cutter at a Kroger-owned Fred Meyer store in
Ellensburg, Washington. “And we’re very, very impacted with these rising
prices.”

Trumpism. Progressives need to accept this

As Democrats think about how to counter the Trump administration, they need to
accept a very simple lesson from the last eight years. Big tech and big
business are part of the political opposition working on behalf of Donald
Trump, not the Democrats’ allies working against Trump and Trumpism.

It shouldn’t seem necessary to point out what seems to be an obvious fact.
Nonetheless, there are some Democrats trying to stay close to big tech, or
downplaying the importance of anti-monopoly policy when it comes to
authoritarian risks. For example, a few days ago, Priorities USA, the largest
Democratic party Super Pac, held a big resistance strategy session hosted by
“our friends at Google”.

economy.

Trump announced on Monday that he will sign an executive order placing a 25%
tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, along with an additional 10%
tariff on imports from China, in purported retaliation for drugs and migrants
crossing US borders.

The US’s largest department store chain, which owns other brands such as

Some British retailers and wholesalers have been forced to switch to sourcing
oranges from South Africa and South America early after last month’s
catastrophic floods in eastern Spain left farmers struggling to harvest and
ship their crops.

Companies in the UK have moved to buying fruit from the southern hemisphere

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
