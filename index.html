            <p>Interviews and analysis of court documents show how the world’s most
prestigious consulting firm quietly helps fuel the climate crisis

Two giant, mirrored walls are set to rise out of the sands of the Arabian
desert. They will run parallel for more than 100 miles from the coast of the
Red Sea through arid valleys and craggy mountains. Between them, a futuristic
city which has no need for cars or roads will be powered completely by
renewable energy.

This engineering marvel, its creators say, will usher in “a revolution in
civilization”. It’s the jewel in the crown of a $500bn Saudi government
project known as Neom, turning a vast scrubland into a techno-utopia and
world-class tourist and sporting destination. Perhaps a harbinger for the end
of oil, it will supposedly put the powerful petrostate at the forefront of the
energy transition. For American consulting giant McKinsey &amp; Company, its
advising on this project appears to be making good on the firm’s green
promises.

In sports broadcasting’s equivalent of a team changing its colors from red to
blue in mid-season, the Diamond Sports Group, a bankrupt operator of 16
regional sports networks, last month rebranded its channels as the FanDuel
Sports Network.

The prior name was already linked to gambling – Bally’s held the branding
rights for three years. But FanDuel is a higher-profile new partner with a
much larger parent company. Flutter, headquartered in New York and originating
from the Irish-British merger of Paddy Power and Betfair, is the world’s
largest online betting business.

Oil and chemical companies who created a high-profile alliance to end plastic
pollution have produced 1,000 times more new plastic in five years than the
waste they diverted from the environment, according to new data obtained by
Greenpeace.

The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) was set up in 2019 by a group of
companies which include ExxonMobil, Dow, Shell, TotalEnergies and
ChevronPhillips, some of the world’s biggest producers of plastic. They
promised to divert 15m tonnes of plastic waste from the environment in five
years to the end of 2023, by improving collection and recycling, and creating
a circular economy.

US justice department officials plan to ask a judge to force Google to sell

Chinese online marketplace Temu has enjoyed explosive international growth off
the back of an eye-catching and often absurdly cheap range of products, but
those cut-price tactics have met increasing roadblocks as it seeks to conquer
new markets in south-east Asia.

Indonesia ordered Temu to be taken down from app stores in October, a move it

threatened to ban Temu and fellow Chinese-owned fast-fashion outlet Shein by
the end of the month, saying they had not been approved to do business in the
country.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
