            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Trump may soon name pick for open Fed board seat and Fed chair nominee, but
Bessent wants to stay in current role

Donald Trump said he would “shortly” announce his pick for an open seat on the
Federal Reserve’s board of governors and possibly his nominee for Fed chair as
well, but that he had removed the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, from
consideration since Bessent wants to remain in his current job.

In a CNBC interview, Trump called it a “pleasant surprise” that the Fed
governor Adriana Kugler had decided to leave her seat now instead of when her
term ends in January, a move that appears to have accelerated Trump’s decision
on who to appoint to an open seat on the Fed board with possible plans to
promote that person to the top policymaking role when the term of the Fed
chair, Jerome Powell, ends in May.

Donald Trump’s words and actions rarely align perfectly. If you watch
carefully, what he doesn’t say can be just as telling as what he does.

“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,
to bring down the prices of all goods,” he told the nation ahead of his re-
election. The US president declared that 2 April would “forever be remembered

the resignation of the chief executive, Debra Crew.

The FTSE 100 company, which owns brands including Guinness, Johnnie Walker
whisky, Gordon’s gin and Smirnoff vodka, reported a nearly 28% fall in
operating profit in the 12 months to the end of June compared with a year
earlier.

China is urging its electric vehicle industry to stop cutting prices and rein

growth.

In recent months Chinese officials have talked repeatedly of the need to
combat “involution” in sectors suffering from overcapacity, such as EVs,
referring to the phenomenon of investing more effort and money for diminishing
returns.

chief executive, Elon Musk, after a US court ruled against a previous pay deal
for the world’s richest person.

Musk will pay $2bn to buy 96m shares in the electric carmaker at the same
price per share as a 10-year pay package agreed in 2018, which is stuck in
legal limbo awaiting a court date for an appeal. The award was based on a
recommendation from a “special committee” of the board.

labor statistics chief amid slow job growth

Donald Trump administration officials fanned out on Sunday’s US political
shows to defend the president’s policies after a bruising week of poor
economic, trade and employment numbers that culminated with the firing of
labor statistics chief Erika McEntarfer.

The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said Trump had “real concerns”
about the jobs numbers that extend beyond Friday’s report that showed the
national economy added 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. Job growth
numbers were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well.

In March 2020, about the time the Covid pandemic started, Christina Chapman, a
woman who lived in Arizona and Minnesota, received a message on LinkedIn
asking her to “be the US face” of a company and help overseas IT workers gain
remote employment.

As working from home became the norm for many people, Chapman was able to find
jobs for the foreign workers at hundreds of US companies, including some in
the Fortune 500, such as Nike; “a premier Silicon Valley technology company”;
and one of the “most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the
world”.

I come from Trinidad and Tobago. As a country that was once colonized by the
British, I am wary of the ways that inequalities between the global north and
global south risk being perpetuated in the digital age.

When we consider the lack of inclusion of the global south in discussions
about artificial intelligence (AI), I think about how this translates to an
eventual lack of economic leverage and geopolitical engagement in this
technology that has captivated academics within the industrialised country I
reside, the United States.

Back in April after his “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, the talk was of
the president crashing the global economy. Then, after a Wall Street backlash,
the world learned the acronym “Taco”, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens
Out”. Now, things are heating up again.

According to Donald Trump’s White House, the US economy is booming, inflation
is dead and jobs are surging. A blizzard of economic reports has cast a pall
on such claims in recent days.

This week’s data on Trump’s early economic record was mixed – good, mad and
ugly – with jobs numbers so weak he reached for the catchphrase he once used
to build himself into a reality TV star: you’re fired.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
