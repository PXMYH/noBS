            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>From mountain-top wind turbines in Norway to rooftop solar panels in
Australia, renewable energy is flooding into power networks like never before.
Because the output from these new sources fluctuates with the changing winds
and the movement of the sun, they often deliver more electricity than grids
can absorb, leading to the curious phenomenon of “negative” power prices.

spending and some EU leaders are planning to meet on Monday in Paris to start
drawing up their response. The moves come as the US pushes for a quick end to
the war in Ukraine and after Vice President JD Vance attacked longstanding
European allies at a security conference Friday. The Opening Trade has

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>It’s “dangerous” for the US and Russia to discuss the war in Ukraine without
representatives from Kyiv, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy
said on The Pulse. Top US and Russian officials are due to hold talks on
Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, following last week’s phone call between presidents
Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on finding ways to resolve the war. Meanwhile
several European Union leaders said the decision to omit a majority of member
states from a hastily arranged summit in Paris risks sending the wrong signal
about the bloc’s unity. President Emmanuel Macron invited seven nations,
including the UK, to discuss defense spending Monday after the sharp US policy
shift under Donald Trump. Today&#39;s guests: Wei Li, BlackRock Global Chief

NLRB and EEOC

As a presidential candidate last fall, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to
battle for US workers, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has

will help Trump’s billionaire business friends, most notably Elon Musk and
Jeff Bezos.

In his first few weeks back in office, Trump fired the acting chair of the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog
without a quorum to enforce laws that protect workers’ right to unionize.

The government has rushed forward plans for a £2.5bn investment in the UK
steel industry after Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on all imports of
steel and aluminium into the US.

The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, will publish a green paper entitled
Plan for Steel on Sunday – several weeks before schedule – in a sign of how
Trump’s tariffs are sending shock waves through a UK government desperate to
kickstart economic growth.

Mexico’s. In its entirety the US economy is about eight times larger than both
the Canadian and Mexican economies … combined!

Trump is a bully sitting on top of the world’s biggest bully – the American
economy. Bullies tend to use their fists to overcome others. Sometimes they
can be outwitted. But we all know that strength and size means everything.

It was a Wednesday in November 2023. Earlier that day D’Alessandro’s husband

with unexpected weather.

From her 1975 “gay cowboys” T-shirt to pioneering catwalk collections that
challenged gender norms, the late Vivienne Westwood has long been heralded as
an LGBT+ icon.

But the fashion house she built over five decades faces serious questions
about whether the late designer’s values have endured, after allegations about
homophobic bullying by its chief executive, Carlo D’Amario, were upheld by an
independent investigation, the Guardian understands.

Last month Donald Trump signed a slew of executive orders overturning
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the federal government, in
a backlash against measures to help underrepresented groups.

Since then, many large US corporates have followed suit and announced they are
dropping or overhauling policies or schemes. Here we examine what has changed
and how far the rollback might go.

            <p>Super Bowl appearance continues the retailer’s vibe shift from slightly boring
staples into a raved-about brand

Almost a week on from the Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar’s half-time performance
is still being talked about. In particular, the pair of boot-cut jeans worn by
the American rapper as he commanded the stage. But while those came from the
luxury fashion brand Celine and cost £830, the scores of backup dancers
surrounding him wore a high street label – to be precise, £19.90 oversized
T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo.

It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily
grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For
a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless
casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift. It now infiltrates the wardrobes of
everyone from gen Z youngsters who love its cargo joggers and cult crossbody
bag, to their grandparents who rave about its Heattech thermals and affordable
cashmere jumpers.

Its co-owner Stephen Slaughter said that about 90% of its dishes depend on
eggs, ticking off a short list: “Our French toast, our pancake batters, our
hollandaise sauce, obviously eggs and omelets.” So when his vendors started
charging $8 for a dozen eggs, all six Green Egg Cafe locations felt the pinch.

record summer heat, panic buying and distribution problems.

The government will release up to 210,000 tonnes of rice, the agriculture

more than 50% in recent months.

Australia has rejected Chinese allegations an Australian airforce plane
“deliberately intruded into China’s airspace” and undermined its national
security, saying the actions of a Chinese navy fighter pilot who released
flares near the Australian aircraft were “wrong … and very very dangerous”.

unprofessional” incident by allegedly dropping flares dangerously close to an
Australian patrol flight on what it described as routine operations in the
South China Sea on Tuesday.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
