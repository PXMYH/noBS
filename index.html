overvalued.

            <p>New lawsuit aimed at Amazon questions the legitimacy of the word ‘buy’ when it
comes to owning a movie on your devices

A possible class-action lawsuit against Amazon Prime, one of the world’s
biggest platforms for streaming film and television, has raised an odd

The proposed lawsuit, which was filed last week in federal court and first
reported by the Hollywood Reporter, alleges that Prime’s practice of offering
users the chance to “buy” (as opposed to “rent”) content is inherently

– but that Amazon, like many other streaming services, is really just selling
its customers viewing licenses that can be revoked at any time, in keeping
with fine print that most customers do not read or understand.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
