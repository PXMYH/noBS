            <p>Despite rumors of ‘quiet quitting’ and ‘coffee badging’, people know work is
work and the perfect job doesn’t exist

If you read the media, you’ll walk away with this impression: American
employees are fed up. They’re doing the “bare minimum” on Mondays,
“cushioning” their careers with side gigs, “rage applying” to vent their
frustrations and “coffee badging” to protest return-to-office policies.

US workers are “ghost quitting” (checking out without actually leaving their
jobs) and pretending to work when actually practicing “productivity theater”.
They’re taking paid time off without authorization in the form of “hush trips”
and “quiet vacations”. They’re suffering from “Zoom doom” and paying an
“emotional labor tax”. According to the latest polls, things are so bad that
they’re “quietly cracking”.

            <p>Traffic is down at America’s busiest port complex – and anxious dock workers
are fearful of further economic harm

Southern California may be known for celebrities and glitz, but the true
action has long been about 40 miles away from Hollywood, in a place where
high-visibility coveralls and hardhats dominate.

For the past 25 years, the San Pedro Bay port complex – comprising the Port of
Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach – has been the celebrity of the
shipping world and an economic driver of California’s huge economy. The
busiest seaport in the western hemisphere and one of the busiest in the world,
approximately 15,000 longshore workers usually pull shifts around the clock,
moving billions of dollars’ worth of cargo in cars, agriculture, auto parts,
toys, clothes and furniture.

            <p>Tariff chaos hampers Trump’s pledge to ‘drill, baby, drill’, but analysis
still shows surge in planet-heating emissions

  * ‘A ruthless agenda’: charting 100 days of Trump’s onslaught on the environment

Donald Trump’s ambitions for the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more fossil
fuels have ironically been hampered by the economic chaos unleashed by his own
tariffs, but the US is still on track to increase oil and gas extraction,
causing a surge in planet-heating emissions, a new analysis shows.

The US was already the world’s leading oil and gas power, producing more of

            <p>Comments come a week after Trump claimed talks were already taking place

Beijing is “evaluating” an offer from the US to engage in trade negotiations,
the Chinese government has said, a week after Donald Trump claimed talks were
already under way.

China’s commerce ministry said on Friday: “The US has recently taken the
initiative on many occasions to convey information to China through relevant
parties, saying it hopes to talk with China.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
