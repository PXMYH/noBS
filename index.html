            <p>Politics of carmaker’s owner has soured sentiments in Grünheide, south-east of
Berlin, where the factory promised jobs and revitalisation

When Elon Musk advised Germans to vote for the far-right Alternative für
Deutschland (AfD) in elections last year, Manu Hoyer – who lives in the small
town where the billionaire had built Tesla’s European production hub – wrote
to the state premier to complain.

“How can you do business with someone who supports rightwing extremism?” she
asked Dietmar Woidke, the Social Democrat leader of the eastern state of
Brandenburg, who had backed the setting up of the Tesla Giga factory in
Grünheide.

  * Undocumented builders face exploitation amid Trump raids

Undocumented farm workers feel they’re being “hunted like animals”, they told
the Guardian, as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up its crackdown on
immigration.

Raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have caused workers to lose
hours and income, and forced them into hiding at home, according to
interviews.

            <p>The expanding group of emerging powers is building new rules, new tools and a
shared industrial future – with or without Donald Trump

The Brics summit in Brazil last week revealed a loose alliance of emerging
powers becoming more complex – and perhaps more consequential. For Brics, heft
matters. It now counts 11 member states – including Indonesia, which joined
this year – representing half the world’s population and 40% of the global
economy, outpacing the G7 by $20tn.

Yet its size hides its contradictions. The grouping’s call for more inclusive
global institutions sounds welcome, but there is a preponderance of
autocracies within its own ranks. Brics is right that international law should
be upheld in Middle Eastern conflicts. But it climbs down from its moral
pedestal by condemning Ukraine’s strikes on Russian infrastructure – while
staying silent on Moscow’s relentless attacks on civilians.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
