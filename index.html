            <p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news

  * Rising home and gas costs pushed US inflation higher than expected in March
  * Tesco says grocery inflation has lessened as it plans £500m efficiency savings
  * Ratings agency downgrades China debt outlook over economic uncertainty

Fitch’s downgrading of China’s credit outlook today highlights the dilemma
that policymakers are facing, as they try to stimulate growth and cut debt
levels, explains **Lynn Song,** chief economist for Greater China at **ING** :

On one hand, there is certainly a need to support economic growth in the near
term, and fiscal support in our view is important in order to avoid falling
into a so-called “Japanisation” trap, where the economy enters into a negative
feedback loop of weak confidence, falling asset prices, and slower economic
growth. This will cause government debt levels to rise in the near term.

On the other hand, long-term fiscal consolidation efforts remain important. In
China’s case, finding a viable alternative for land sales is an important step
to take in the medium term, but the obvious solutions to this – like
increasing other taxes – are unpalatable at the moment given the current state
of the economy. Nonetheless, the land sale driven model of government
financing will also need to change as China’s economy transitions.

“Fitch’s outlook revision reflects the more challenging situation in China’s
public finance regarding the double whammy of decelerating growth and more
debt.”

“With lagging private investment, state-backed funding has become even more
important in driving growth, either in terms of infrastructure spending or in
local government guidance funds for high tech industries.”

A credit rating agency (it does not matter which) has done something (it does
not matter what) to China’s rating outlook. Investors will already be aware of
the underlying economics behind this move.

The US’s top labor lawyer has said her agency will not “succumb” to Amazon,
Starbucks and SpaceX’s attempts to legally challenge the National Labor
Relations Board and its ability to enforce federal labor law.

Jennifer Abruzzo, the NLRB general counsel, accused some of the US’s largest
corporations of “jumping on the bandwagon” in mounting legal challenges to the

            <p>Stock has become actively shorted as traders are betting on company’s fall,

Donald Trump’s media and technology group, DJT, has lost about 36% of its
value since it began publicly trading on 22 March, dropping the former
president’s stake to about $2.8bn.

As of Monday afternoon, DJT stock was priced at about $36 – down from a high
of $66 seen on 27 March. But market analysts are saying it’s too soon to draw
any firm conclusions from the depreciation because the stock has become one of
the most actively shorted on the Nasdaq exchange – meaning traders have been
betting that it will fall.

Superhuman artificial intelligence that is smarter than anyone on Earth could
exist next year, Elon Musk has said, unless the sector’s power and computing
demands become unsustainable before then.

The prediction is a sharp tightening of an earlier claim from the
multibillionaire, that superintelligent AI would exist by 2029. Whereas
“superhuman” is generally defined as being smarter than any individual human
at any specific task, superintelligent is often defined instead as being
smarter than every human’s combined ability at any task.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
