            <p>Artificial intelligence can make companies more efficient and workers happier
– or cause mass misery. The choice is ours

As artificial intelligence spreads rapidly across America’s economy, there’s a
lively debate about how it will transform the future of work. What many people

surveillance apps track how much time workers spend in trips to the bathroom,
with some workers protesting that the time limits are too strict.

Some of the US’s most profitable corporations, including General Motors,
Citigroup and Netflix, have slashed their tax bills in the years since the
passage of the Trump tax cuts, with nearly a quarter paying rates in the
single digits and 23 paying nothing, a report has found.

The 2017 law cut the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. But the
new assessment of corporate tax avoidance, published on Thursday by the non-
profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep), found that during the

Investor excitement over artificial intelligence reached a new peak this week

The rally began on Thursday and continued into Friday, as Nvidia overtook

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who

than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
