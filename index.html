Texas officials have added NatWest Group to a growing list of financial firms

that could limit the UK bank’s business with the oil-rich US state.

The American coffee chain poached the boss of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Brian
Niccol, naming him as its new chief executive this week in a surprise
management shake-up, ousting Laxman Narasimhan from the job after just 17

Meta is struggling with moderating content related to the Israel-Palestine

documents have revealed.

Internal policy guidelines shared with the Guardian by a former Meta employee
who worked on content moderation outline a multilayered process for moderating
content related to the conflict. But the documents indicate Meta, which owns
the platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, does not have the same
processes in place to gauge the accuracy of moderation of Hebrew content and
Arabic content.

FBI-ordered raid over filesharing site

Kim Dotcom, who is facing criminal charges relating to the defunct filesharing
website Megaupload, is to be extradited to the US, the New Zealand justice
minister says, which could end more than a decade of legal wrangling.

German-born Dotcom has New Zealand residency and has been fighting extradition
to the US since 2012 after an FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion. The
high court in New Zealand first approved his extradition in 2017, with an
appeal court reaffirming the finding the year after. In 2020, the country’s
supreme court again affirmed the finding but opened the door for a fresh round
of judicial review.

            <p>Largest regional airline in North America also sued by flight attendant union
for alleged retaliatory firings

SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional airline in North America, is facing
legal action over an alleged “fake” company union that the airline operates
and the allegedly retaliatory firings of flight attendants who were engaged in
union organizing efforts.

A lawsuit was filed by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) in
October 2023. The US Department of Labor also filed a lawsuit last month
against the SkyWest Inflight Association over the “company union”, alleging
SkyWest Inflight Association (SIA) did not perform its legal duties as a
representative agency and barred two employees from running in an election for
leadership positions due to their support for an independent union at the
airline.

This story was amended on 14 August 2024 to correct that the US Department of
Labor filed a lawsuit against SkyWest Airlines Inflight Association, not
SkyWest Airlines itself. It also clarified that the Railway Labor Act, not the
National Labor Relations Act, governs airline employees.

This wasn’t a pop concert or a sports game. It was a marketing event for Walt
Disney, a company with a legion of fans so devoted that about 15,000 were
willing to buy a ticket and come to Anaheim, California, to see its newest
film and TV advertisements first.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their

certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
