China’s president, Xi Jinping, has told businesses to “show their talent” at a
meeting of Chinese industry leaders including the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, as
he attempts to halt an economic slump in the world’s second-largest economy.

Xi met Ma, who was at the centre of a crackdown on the tech industry in recent
years, as well as the bosses of the electric carmaker BYD, the battery
manufacturer CATL, Tencent, Xiaomi, and the founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei

            <p>Britain used to solicit money that the US would not touch – but with oligarchs
and fraudsters on the rise, it must now uphold the law

Five decades ago, the United States was in turmoil. A long and unpopular war
was ending in defeat; inflation was high; and American politicians were
accused of high-handed and illegal behaviour.

If all this sounds remarkably similar to the last few years, that’s because it
is. But the mid-1970s was different in one crucial respect: how the US
responded to it, and particularly how it responded to corruption. Major
corporations had been giving bribes to win contracts in South Korea, Italy and
Saudi Arabia; US politicians were appalled – and they acted to uphold values
other than money.

The American journalist McKay Coppins this weekend published a rare and wide-

            <p>President has begun slashing federal workforce while hobbling labor watchdogs
NLRB and EEOC

As a presidential candidate last fall, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to
battle for US workers, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has
taken a surprisingly large number of anti-worker actions, labor experts say.
Some of those moves, among them hobbling the National Labor Relations Board,
will help Trump’s billionaire business friends, most notably Elon Musk and
Jeff Bezos.

In his first few weeks back in office, Trump fired the acting chair of the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), leaving the US’s top labor watchdog
without a quorum to enforce laws that protect workers’ right to unionize.
Trump has designated Musk, a vehemently anti-union billionaire, to launch an
all-out war against the federal bureaucracy and workforce, and Trump and Musk
have essentially treated the country’s 2 million-plus federal employees as if
they were disposable.

steel and aluminium into the US.

The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, will publish a green paper entitled
Plan for Steel on Sunday – several weeks before schedule – in a sign of how
Trump’s tariffs are sending shock waves through a UK government desperate to
kickstart economic growth.

Why is Donald Trump so obsessed with tariffs? If you ask me, it’s because
America is so freaking huge. California’s economy is bigger than the entire
UK’s. Texas’s is larger than all of Canada’s. Florida’s is larger than all of
Mexico’s. In its entirety the US economy is about eight times larger than both
the Canadian and Mexican economies … combined!

Trump is a bully sitting on top of the world’s biggest bully – the American
economy. Bullies tend to use their fists to overcome others. Sometimes they
can be outwitted. But we all know that strength and size means everything.

When Lisa D’Alessandro and her husband had an offer accepted on a new home in
New Jersey, her excitement did not last long. Two days later, when lenders
requested bank details for their loan, she discovered their savings account
was empty. Her credit card was maxed out, too.

It was a Wednesday in November 2023. Earlier that day D’Alessandro’s husband
had said he needed to get something from his mother’s house. Preparing dinner
for their two young sons, she texted him to ask when he was coming home.

Extreme weather events are expected to lead to volatile food prices throughout

prices of a number of food commodities in the year to January that correlated
with unexpected weather.

            <p>Super Bowl appearance continues the retailer’s vibe shift from slightly boring
staples into a raved-about brand

Almost a week on from the Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar’s half-time performance
is still being talked about. In particular, the pair of boot-cut jeans worn by
the American rapper as he commanded the stage. But while those came from the
luxury fashion brand Celine and cost £830, the scores of backup dancers
surrounding him wore a high street label – to be precise, £19.90 oversized
T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo.

It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily
grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For
a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless
casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift. It now infiltrates the wardrobes of
everyone from gen Z youngsters who love its cargo joggers and cult crossbody
bag, to their grandparents who rave about its Heattech thermals and affordable
cashmere jumpers.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
