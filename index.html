            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>There’s little to trust about Venezuelan elections, which is why the vote on
July 28 has become an interesting one. Nicolás Maduro has had a firm grip on
the country’s presidency since 2013, when he succeeded his late mentor and
predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Of late, Maduro has purged his inner circle, somehow
managed to stabilize a shaky Venezuelan economy, and now seems willing to take
his chances with an open vote.

  * Explainer: How will new EU tariffs on Chinese EVs work?

The EU has notified Beijing that it intends to impose tariffs of up to 38% on
imports of Chinese electric vehicles, triggering duties of more than €2bn
(£1.7bn) a year and a likely trade war with China.

The tariffs will be applied provisionally from next month in line with World

evidence the EU provides to justify the levies on imported EVs.

All across China, from Beijing in the north, to Shenzhen in the south,
millions of newly built homes stand empty and unwanted. There were nearly 391m
sq metres of unsold residential property in China as of April, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics. That is the equivalent of Manchester and
Birmingham combined – and then some – sitting as vacant, unwanted property.

the world’s second largest economy and raised tensions over the purpose of
housebuilding in a nation where property investment had been viewed as a safe
bet.

An Italian lorry driver has described the UK’s new post-Brexit controls as a
“mess” after his lorry was held at a government-run border post for more than
two days.

Antonio Soprano, 62, who was stopped while bringing plants into the country

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
