is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric
vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in
order to restore the business.

International popstar Katy Perry has had a court win in her long-running
trademark battle with an Australian fashion designer over her Katie Perry
trademark loungewear.

Sydney designer Katie Jane Taylor, who sells clothes under her birth name
Katie Perry , sued the singer in October 2019 because the performer was
selling her own merchandise.

            <p>Billionaire CEO is well connected in the US and China, something that could
smooth the road ahead for the electric vehicle maker amid a looming tariff war

If it pays to have friends in high places, few among us can claim to be better
placed than Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and one of the only people to
have cosy relationships with both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. His commercial
and political connections to both may prove pivotal as the feud between the US
and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises
steep tariffs.

Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once supported Joe Biden. But
his relationship with the current US president soured over the past four years
as, among other insults, Musk felt that the White House gave Telsa, his car
and green energy company, “the cold shoulder”. Trump, meanwhile, has described
Tesla as “incredible” even while pledging to do away with subsidies for
electric vehicles. This year, Musk formally endorsed Trump as the presidential
candidate, campaigned for him online and off and donated more than $100m to
his re-election effort.

            <p>Interviews and analysis of court documents show how the world’s most

Two giant, mirrored walls are set to rise out of the sands of the Arabian
desert. They will run parallel for more than 100 miles from the coast of the
Red Sea through arid valleys and craggy mountains. Between them, a futuristic
city which has no need for cars or roads will be powered completely by
renewable energy.

This engineering marvel, its creators say, will usher in “a revolution in
civilization”. It’s the jewel in the crown of a $500bn Saudi government
project known as Neom, turning a vast scrubland into a techno-utopia and
world-class tourist and sporting destination. Perhaps a harbinger for the end
of oil, it will supposedly put the powerful petrostate at the forefront of the
energy transition. For American consulting giant McKinsey &amp; Company, its
advising on this project appears to be making good on the firm’s green
promises.

In sports broadcasting’s equivalent of a team changing its colors from red to
blue in mid-season, the Diamond Sports Group, a bankrupt operator of 16
regional sports networks, last month rebranded its channels as the FanDuel
Sports Network.

The prior name was already linked to gambling – Bally’s held the branding
rights for three years. But FanDuel is a higher-profile new partner with a
much larger parent company. Flutter, headquartered in New York and originating
from the Irish-British merger of Paddy Power and Betfair, is the world’s
largest online betting business.

            <p>Despite president-elect’s vow, energy companies focus on managing resources to
be profitable, not pumping more oil

At the Republican national convention in July, Donald Trump pledged to cut gas
prices by boosting domestic oil production. “We will drill, baby, drill,” he
declared.

Despite the president-elect’s promise, oil and gas companies probably have
other ideas. For the past few years, US energy producers have focused on
keeping costs down to stay profitable, balancing between producing enough oil
to satisfy global energy needs and paying shareholders big dividends,
according to energy experts. That’s unlikely to change soon.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
