A former flight attendant at Delta Air Lines has filed a lawsuit against the

China’s leaders seem to have invoked the definition of insanity, attributed,
perhaps wrongly, to Einstein: doing the same thing over and over again, and
expecting different results.

For the fourth time in 16 years, Beijing has been spooked by faltering growth
into adopting an array of economic stimulus measures designed to reset the
economy. It didn’t work for long in 2008, 2015 or 2021, and the “bazooka”
measures announced recently will also most likely come up short.

metal band Limp Bizkit.

Three decades after it rose to prominence, the band and its founder, Fred

after negotiations with opposition Socialists

Portugal will attempt to stem the country’s brain drain by offering young
people a decade of progressive tax breaks that would see them paying nothing
at all in their first year of work.

The centre-right minority government of Luís Montenegro is ditching a proposed
15% cap on income tax for 18- to 35-year-olds and replacing it with a
progressive scheme similar to one supported by the opposition Socialists after
some last-minute wrangling.

Inflation weakened to its slowest pace in more than three years last month, as
price growth continued to fall back from its highest levels in a generation.

With concerns over the heightened cost of living at the heart of the
presidential election campaign, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its

            <p>From football clubs to water companies, music catalogues to care homes,
private equity has infiltrated almost every facet of modern life in its
endless search to maximise profits

Whenever I ponder the enormity of the multitrillion-dollar industry known as
private equity, I picture the lavish parties thrown by Stephen Schwarzman –
and then I think of the root canals. Schwarzman is the billionaire impresario
of Blackstone, the world’s most colossal private equity firm. In August, he
hosted a 200-person housewarming party at his $27m (£21m) French neoclassical
mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. It was a modest affair compared to the grand
soiree he threw himself at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate for his 70th
birthday, in 2017. That black-tie bash was itself a sequel to his
multimillion-dollar 60th, in 2007, which became a symbol of the sort of Wall
Street excess that led to the global financial crisis. The Palm Beach party,
which some reports say cost more than $10m, featured Venetian gondolas,
Arabian camels, Mongolian acrobats and a giant cake in the shape of a Chinese
temple. “Brilliantly stimulating” was the billionaire industrialist David
Koch’s review. Gwen Stefani serenaded Schwarzman as Jared Kushner, Ivanka
Trump and several members of her father’s cabinet looked on. It was a world in
miniature, ruled over by a modern Croesus – the perfect symbol for a form of
money-making that has infiltrated almost every facet of modern life.

Preschools and funeral homes, car washes and copper mines, dermatologists and
datacentres – private equity is anywhere and everywhere that money changes
hands. If it can in any way be marketed or monetised, private equity firms
have bought it – from municipal water supplies to European football clubs to
the music catalogue of the rock group Queen. By some estimates, these firms
now control more than $13tn invested in more than 50,000 companies worldwide.
“We cannot overestimate the reach of private equity across the global
economy,” Sachin Khajuria, a former partner at Apollo Global Management, which
manages half a trillion dollars in assets, wrote in 2022.

The cost of living is the number one issue for US voters. After years of
outsized price rises, some economists say inflation is finally under control
and the US economy is heading for a so-called “soft-landing” with price
increases slowing and the jobs market remaining strong. Polls show many
Americans feel less confident.

How do you feel about the US economy? How is inflation still impacting you?

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
