Twin Cities Pride, the non-profit that organizes an annual Pride festival in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, announced that it had raised more than $50,000 after
publicly dropping Target as a corporate sponsor.

The group said it had removed Target as a sponsor of the festival after the
company dropped some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies on
24 January: Target said it would stop its anti-discrimination efforts,
including participation in external surveys, such as one run by the Human
Rights Campaign, which tracks LGBTQ+ inclusive corporate policies such as
spousal and domestic partner benefits and outreach to communities. The company
also said it would end a program that helped it carry more products from
Black- and minority-owned businesses, among other changes.

chatbot was reluctant to discuss sensitive questions about China and its

OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI models, but using fewer resources.

By Monday, DeepSeek’s AI assistant had rapidly overtaken ChatGPT as the most

New Zealand has relaxed its visitor visa rules to attract so-called “digital

Visitor visas will now allow people to work remotely for a foreign employer
while they are visiting New Zealand for up to 90 days. The visa can be

DEI efforts in the federal government

Within his first few days in office, Donald Trump reversed four years of work
to increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the federal
government.

Since taking office, he’s signed a flurry of executive orders, two of which
amount to crackdowns on DEI within the federal government. One overturns Joe
Biden’s efforts to increase DEI programs in the federal government, while a
second bans DEI measures from being taken by the federal government.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, exporters to the US are preparing for an era of disruption
if tariffs are imposed

Donald Trump, a self-declared “big believer” in tariffs on foreign goods, has
promised to use them to boost the US economy, revitalize America’s industrial
heartlands, and reward the tens of millions of voters who sent him back to the
White House.

“Come make your product in America,” the president told top executives
gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, promising low taxes
to those who take him up on the invitation. “But if you don’t make your
product in America – which is your prerogative – then, very simply, you will
have to pay a tariff.”

From a modern control room high above the canal expansion – overlooking the
Cocolí locks, then lakes, rainforest canopy and, eventually, the Atlantic
ocean – it barely registers that the era of gunboat diplomacy is returning to
the Panama canal.

But four days into Donald Trump’s second administration, here we are. Trump
has declared that he is “taking back” the Panama canal, sending TV crews from
Washington to Beijing scrambling here to cover a crisis that has led to
frenzied diplomatic efforts and elicited fears of a repeat of the 1989 US
military invasion.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
