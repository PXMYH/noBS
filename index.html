AstraZeneca is making a big push into the weight-loss drug market, striking an

diabetes pill that is in early stage development.

Britain’s biggest drugmaker said it had agreed a deal with Eccogene, based in
Shanghai, for an experimental drug named ECC5004 that would also treat
cardiometabolic conditions such as heart disease and stroke. Obesity and
diabetes affect more than 1 billion people globally. Eccogene will receive up
to $2bn (£1.6bn) under the terms of the deal.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>After four months, the Sag-Aftra film and television union has reached a
tentative deal, but we may be waiting a while for the art itself to triumph

It’s over. The stream of sweatshirted and placard-wielding Instagram no-
filter/no-makeup posts from stars is at an end. The Sag-Aftra film and
television actors’ strike in Hollywood is paused after four months, with a
tentative deal giving actors larger minimum-pay increases, a streaming bonus
and “consent and compensation” provisions against AI, although how exactly
this last is to be enforced remains to be seen. For those who had thought of
Hollywood as the very epitome of free-marketeerism, the spectacle of an actual
strike, which remained reasonably popular and un-demonised in the press, and
which produced a result, is quite startling. Especially as British Equity
doesn’t have this kind of power.  
  
In the movies themselves, from Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront to Sylvester
Stallone in FIST to Peter Sellers’ Hitler-moustached shop steward Fred Kite in
I’m All Right Jack, there is a long tradition of showing unions and union
activity as dramatically compromised. The closing scene of Sergei Eisenstein’s
Strike shows the workers being collectively shot, interspersed with images of
a cow being slaughtered. But today’s Hollywood cow is in pretty good shape,
despite rumours that studios have been using the strike as a cover to make
production cuts.  
  
But what does it mean for the moviegoing public? Well, not perhaps all that
much immediately, unlike the writers’ strike in the US where talkshows were
suspended and Drew Barrymore was criticised for breaking the strike by
attempting to restart her show. Production can reportedly recommence on titles
such as Deadpool 3, Gladiator 2 and Wicked which had been stymied, and a
release can be scheduled for delayed films including Dune: Part Two – but the
unblocking of all these sequels and adaptations does not on the face of it
seem like a reflowering of creativity or “storytelling” which industry honchos
solemnly declare to be their vocation.  
  
Striking Hollywood actors had been forbidden to make promotional appearances,
which had meant not appearing on talkshows. Perhaps British TV audiences for
The Graham Norton Show or The Jonathan Ross Show might not have noticed any
great difference, but we have seen a greater emphasis on non-film-promo
celebrity turns: Arnold Schwarzenegger has been around to boost his self-help
book and Dame Judi Dench her work on Shakespeare. And we have been spared that
most depressing of phenomena – the group appearance, whereby three or four
people from the same film sit grinningly on the sofa and hog all the limelight
and turn the programme into an advertorial for their film.  
  
But during the strike, Hollywood stars had been allowed to put their heads
over the parapet on the understanding that they were doing so as producers,
and film festival selectors had reportedly gone easier on movie stars’
“passion projects” on the understanding that they would be allowed to make a
red-carpet appearance as producers. This was surely the case with Chris Pine
and his wacky, sub-Lebowski film Poolman this year, in which he was director,
star, co-writer and co-producer – and which had people at the London film
festival groaning and checking the time on their phones. The strike had given
oxygen to Chris Pine and Poolman which should maybe have been withheld. The
end of the strike will mean business (almost) as usual: streamers and studios
will have drawn in their horns; performers will be encouraged to stay in their
lanes, but with the knowledge that this is still a really lucrative industry –
and actors have triumphantly restaked their claim in it.

dubs the “low-wage 100”. These companies paid their employees – including
workers outside the US and part-time workers – a median wage of $31,672 in

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility
