“I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a

said in a statement on Monday, adding: “Through a series of Tax Incentives and
Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen
FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!”

            <p>The board of the non-profit Code for Science &amp; Society blocked a statement
against genocide. The fallout tore the high-profile organization apart

Miliaku Nwabueze, a senior program manager at Code for Science &amp; Society, had
been concerned for some time about the role of technology in state violence.
Then, on 7 October of last year, Hamas entered Israel, killing and kidnapping
about 1,400 people. Less than a week later, as Israel ordered 1.1 million
Palestinians out of northern Gaza in the onset of its deadly retaliation,
Nwabueze decided to write a message to her colleagues on the US-based non-
profit organization’s Slack channel.

“Hey y’all … I have been watching multiple genocides around the world,” she
began, naming Palestine as well as Sudan, the Congo and Artsakh. “All of these
have heavy linkages to the tech industry.” The 30-year-old went on to assert
that CS&amp;S – whose stated mission is to “advance the power of data to improve
the social and economic lives of all people” – should say, at the minimum, “we
support demands for a ceasefire” in Gaza.

Tesla shareholders voting to reinstate it

A judge ruled on Monday that Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is still not
entitled to receive a $56bn compensation package even though shareholders of
the electric vehicle company had voted to reinstate it six months ago.

The ruling by the Delaware judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the court of
chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive
and rescinded it, surprising investors. The decision cast uncertainty over
Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker. Tesla’s board argued the
enormous payment scheme was necessary to keep Musk involved in the company, an
argument that the billionaire, already the world’s richest man, echoed.

23andMe is facing implosion. As the once-promising genetic testing company
flounders – losing 98% of its $6bn value, all its independent board members,
nearly half its staff – many of its 15 million customers are scrambling to
delete their DNA data from the company’s archives. I am one of them.

My reluctant path to 23andMe began in 2016, when I ordered a kit in the mail.
After letting the box sit on my desk for weeks, I finally spit in a tube and
sent it to the company for analysis. I am a technology journalist – I like to
think I am thoughtful about what data I share with corporations. When it comes
to genetic data, which unlike a password or credit card number cannot ever be
changed, I was particularly wary.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
