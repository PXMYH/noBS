            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Tesla’s board is dangling a gargantuan payout in front of its chief. Is it a
manipulative ploy or a desperate stunt?

Bribery is generally unethical and often illegal, but also quite effective.
When my four-year-old is acting up and ignoring my increasingly desperate
pleas for her to get dressed, leave the playground or do something else very
important, I have, on occasion, resorted to desperate promises of ice-cream.
Obviously, I know it’s counterproductive to respond to suboptimal behaviour
with sugar-based bribes. But sometimes you are exhausted and just need a
short-term win. The ice-cream always delivers.

It seems trying to motivate a four-year-old is not much different from trying
to keep a petulant 54-year-old tech mogul in line. On Friday, Tesla’s board of
directors rolled out a pay package proposal for CEO Elon Musk that could, if
he plays his cars right, turn the billionaire into the world’s first
trillionaire. In a section of Tesla’s latest stock market update that began:
“Yes, you read that correctly”, the board outlines everything Musk has to do
to get his hands on that performance-based trillion. Which, to be fair, is a
lot. Tesla needs to reach a market cap of $8.5tn, eight times its current
value, in 10 years to get Musk the payout. Many analysts believe Tesla is
already overvalued, so this is no small task.

Weleda, founded 104 years ago and known worldwide for its holistic remedies,
**** sourced large quantities of medicinal herbs during the Nazi era from an
agricultural plantation overseen by the SS in Dachau, southern Germany,
according to a major report by Anne Sudrow commissioned by the Dachau
Concentration Camp Memorial Site.

Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
