            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The ex-president is now majority owner of an unpopular website worth billions
– and the truth behind how that happened really isn’t all that impressive

A lot of people think investing in the stock market is rigged in favor of the
big investors, the large financial firms and the people in the know. Small-fry
individual investors have as much chance of success on Wall Street as they do
at the Bellagio. Donald Trump’s recent windfall isn’t going to win any
converts.

Trump merged his unprofitable and tiny Truth Social platform, which has
reportedly lost tens of millions of dollars, into a shell company that was
previously created and already had a value of billions. The shell company is
called a Spac, which is an entity created to take a private business public
without conducting an initial public offering (and therefore avoiding much of
the regulatory scrutiny).

When trade ministers gathered in the Moroccan city of Marrakech 30 years ago
this month to sign the agreement creating the World Trade Organization (WTO),
the mood was celebratory. The Berlin Wall had come down only recently,
communism had collapsed, and there was optimistic talk of how the body would
prise open new markets and act as the arbiter when disputes broke out between
countries.

The atmosphere today is much darker than it was in April 1994. Any enthusiasm
for groundbreaking trade liberalisation deals disappeared decades ago and has
been replaced by covert – and often overt – protectionism.

A jury in Manhattan found a Singapore-based former crypto CEO liable on civil
fraud charges on Friday, agreeing with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission that both he and his firm misled investors before the 2022 collapse
of the company’s namesake cryptocurrency wrecked cryptocurrency markets.

The jury delivered the verdict in federal court after a two-week trial after
hearing closing arguments earlier in the day. The Terraform Labs founder Do
Kwon did not attend the trial, as he has been detained in Montenegro since
March 2023. He was intercepted while on his way to Dubai on the lam from
authorities in multiple countries, traveling using forged Costa Rican travel
documents.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
