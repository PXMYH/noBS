            <p>Companies say Biden’s blocking of the proposed purchase over national security
concerns violates constitution

US Steel and Nippon Steel have filed a lawsuit against Joe Biden’s order that
blocked the $14.9bn buyout of the American steelmaker by the Japanese company,
they said on Monday.

The lawsuit asked the court to set aside the review process of the committee
on foreign investment in the US and Biden’s order, citing “violation of the
constitutional guarantee of due process and statutory procedural requirements,
as well as unlawful political influence”.

            <p>President-elect has threatened to levy tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico
and China, which can burden businesses

With Donald Trump threatening to impose steep tariffs upon his return to
office this month, US firms are bracing for impact. **** But an analysis of
Trump’s last presidency identified one way to boost their chances of avoiding
the levies: donating to the Republican party.

While the initial stage of the president-elect’s tariff agenda is designed to
hit America’s largest trading partners – Canada, Mexico and China **** – it is
US firms that pick up the bill, paying duties imposed on the goods they buy
from these markets. Such additional costs can prove devastating.

those of the terroirs of France, Spain and Italy.

At about €60 (£50) a bottle and produced in small quantities, it is far from a
commercial activity, but efforts over the last 10 years have produced what one
retailer described as an “arguably very fine” rosé.

            <p>In a new book, Dana Frank tells stories of the people who ‘made history

Historian Dana Frank treasures a photo from a 1937 edition of Life magazine.
It shows a group of seven African American women, clustered close, sitting on
chairs in a small space. Each wears a fashionable hat and is bundled in a coat
appropriate for the late Chicago winter. At first glance, the photo appears to
be a gathering of friends. All are smiling, and some appear to be laughing, as
they talk with each other.

The women were actually on strike, occupying the city hall office of the
president of the Chicago board of health. As wet nurses for a local hospital,
they were paid $0.04 for each ounce of breast milk they produced. The women
all knew that the white wet nurses at another hospital were getting paid $0.10
per ounce. “They shouldn’t make any difference between us,” Louise Clark, a
wet nurse on strike, told reporters at the time.

            <p>Performance improvement plans are often a precursor of dismissal but workers
can make themselves harder to fire

If there’s one thing I’ve learned about large, corporate customers is that
trying to get anything done with their employees between 15 December and 15
January is impossible. Nearly everyone’s on vacation. And, c’mon, let’s all
agree: the ones who aren’t on vacation aren’t working very hard.

You can’t blame them. They’re getting their paychecks. They’ve earned their
four weeks of time off. Most small businesses can’t do this. We have cashflow
challenges. We don’t have the luxury to sit back and collect our pay. We need
to get contracts signed, bills paid and products approved and that’s made
infinitely more difficult when our corporate counterparts are still drinking
eggnog and watching Hallmark movies instead of being at work. But if you work
for a big corporation, you better be careful. And don’t say you haven’t been
warned.

On Golba Hill on the Caribbean island of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG),
just below a cluster of colourfully decorated homes, there are rows and rows
of premium marijuana plants. Gleaming like green gold in the Caribbean sun,
they lead up to a crudely constructed hut where cannabis farmer Bobbis
Matthews spends most of his time nurturing and protecting his precious field.

As he did his routine inspection, removing male plants that could diminish the
potency of his crop, Matthews recalled a time, not too long ago, when the idea
of a cannabis farm in a residential area was unthinkable.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
