strategy will yield a new “golden age”. All the president needs to do now is

governor’s alleged fraud is ‘unusual’

The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency embraced a highly unusual
process to accuse Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor, of committing
mortgage fraud, former officials and experts have said. One former high-
ranking official called the director’s involvement in a criminal referral
“bizarre”.

William Pulte, a businessman and major GOP donor whom Donald Trump appointed
to head the powerful housing agency earlier this year, has accused Cook of
committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting her homes as a primary residence,
potentially securing more favorable mortgage rates. The justice department
formally opened a criminal investigation into whether Cook committed fraud and
has issued subpoenas related to the transaction. Cook’s lawyers have called
the discrepancies a “clerical error” and she has denied any wrongdoing.

“I deeply respect the right of partners to choose, through a fair and
democratic process, to be represented by a union,” Niccol wrote in a letter to
the union last September. “If our partners choose to be represented, I am
committed to making sure we engage constructively and in good faith with the
union and the partners it represents.”

voters with vow to scrap levy

It is the issue that has set the Norwegian general election alight: whether to

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
