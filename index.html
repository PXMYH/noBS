  * Business live – latest updates

More than $1tn (£760bn) has been wiped off the value of the cryptocurrency
market in the past six weeks amid fears of a tech bubble and fading
expectations for a US rate cut next month.

Tracking more than 18,500 coins, the value of the crypto market has fallen by
a quarter since a high in early October, according to the data company
CoinGecko.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race
over the economy is costing the US president

Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of
grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living,
propelled by the sharp burst of inflation that peaked at 9% a year in July
2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over
prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the
economy. The other theme was race.

The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing
relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban
America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’
economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came
back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is now trying to recover his
economic narrative. But it may be too late.

Gen Z is undisciplined, apparently; entitled, some critics claim; and

far as to suggest this entire generation was potentially “unemployable”.

As younger employees establishing themselves at work continue to face
relentless criticism from the higher rungs of corporate America, those old
enough to remember the arrival of the last generation could be forgiven for
experiencing a sense of deja vu.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>This story of emancipated young women escaping draconian social strictures
brims with enthusiasm and features a cameo from Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Based on a true story, Bill Guttentag’s rousing drama attests to the
resilience of women who dare to dream despite draconian social strictures. The
film follows Roya Mahboob (Nikohl Boosheri), a trailblazing coach and
businesswoman in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) who
assembles a robotics team of Afghan girls for international competitions. The
young dreamers hail from different walks of life but they all share the same
zest for engineering. They face the same dangers too; in a country where women
are not encouraged or even allowed to pursue higher levels of education, their
quest for medals sees opposition from their own families as well as public
scorn from conservatives.

Rule Breakers is at its most thrilling during the competition sequences, which
splice together real-life documentary footage of the events with fictional re-
enactments. (There’s even an appearance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge as a host.)
A breathless enthusiasm thrums through the film, as the camera swirls around
the young competitors, all energised by their love for science. These spaces
are portrayed as a haven that encourages camaraderie rather than
competitiveness, and in a world divided by military conflicts and war, they
offer a utopiian vision of international collaboration and solidarity.

The former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is making a claim of “conspiracy”
against the government of Jersey after the crown dependency launched a
criminal investigation into allegations of corruption and money laundering in
connection with the original source of the oligarch’s wealth.

The latest move threatens to throw open parts of a secretive legal battle on
the Channel island about the tycoon’s rise to become one of the world’s
richest people, which emerged in September after a Switzerland federal
criminal court ordered the release of a cache of Swiss banking records
requested by the Jersey attorney general.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
