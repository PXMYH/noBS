YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5m to settle a suit brought by Donald Trump in
2021 that alleged the platform wrongly suspended his channel after the January
6 attack on the US Capitol. The Google subsidiary is the latest in a long
string of tech companies to make a multimillion-dollar payout to the president
over past decisions about his accounts.

Trump had filed the suit against YouTube and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai,
alleging that the platform had “accumulated an unprecedented concentration of
power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse”.
YouTube said it suspended Trump’s channel because it had violated the
website’s policies against inciting violence. Because of the settlement, the
case is now dismissed. Google did not immediately return a request for
comment.

With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark

Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
