Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka, with 25% duties on products from Brunei
and Moldova and a 20% rate on goods from the Philippines. The levies were
largely in line with rates Trump had initially announced in April, though
Iraq’s duties are down from 39% and Sri Lanka’s reduced from 44%. Trump began
notifying trading partners of new rates on Monday ahead of a deadline this
week for countries to wrap up negotiations with his administration and posted
to social media that he planned to release “a minimum of 7” letters on
Wednesday morning, with additional rates to be posted in the afternoon. Brett

The US company will be asked to “upskill” tens of thousands of civil servants

Tesla’s market capitalisation fell from just over $1tn to about $921bn after
stock markets closed on Wall Street, with the value of Musk’s stake in the
company reduced by nearly $15bn, lowering it to below $120bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>We’ve been living in a great experiment: can finance provide basic human
rights such as housing? The answer is increasingly no

“The housing crisis is now as big a threat to the EU as Russia,” Jaume
Collboni, the mayor of Barcelona, recently declared. “We’re running the risk
of having the working and middle classes conclude that their democracies are
incapable of solving their biggest problem.”

It is not hard to see where Collboni is coming from. From Dublin to Milan,
residents routinely find half of their incomes swallowed up by rent, and home
ownership is unthinkable for most. Major cities are witnessing spiralling
house prices and some have jaw-dropping year-on-year median rent increases of
more than 10%. People are being pushed into ever more precarious and cramped
conditions and homelessness is rapidly rising.

Twenty years ago this weekend, the leaders of the world’s most powerful
countries, chaired by Tony Blair, gathered at the Scottish golf resort of
Gleneagles and made a series of historic promises on debt relief and overseas
aid.

It was the culmination of a long-running campaign involving charities,
churches and celebrities and benefited from the passionate commitment of
Gordon Brown, for whom international development is a lifelong cause.

Nearly 100 years ago, north-west Michigan cherry farmers and Traverse City
community leaders started a festival to promote the city and their region’s
tart cherry crop as a tourist destination.

Now known as the “cherry capital of the world”, Traverse City’s National
Cherry Festival draws 500,000 visitors over eight days to this picturesque
Lake Michigan beach town to enjoy carnival rides and airshows, and to eat
cherries. It also sparked a thriving agrotourism industry amid its rolling
hills that now boasts dozens of shops, wineries, U-pick orchards, and farm-to-
table restaurants helmed by James Beard-award-winning chefs.

            <p>Amy Hawkins visits one of the many bars popping up across Chinese cities
offering drinks, snacks and a vision of the future

In the age of self-help, self-improvement and self-obsession, there have never
been more places to look to for guidance. Where the anxious and the uncertain
might have once consulted a search engine for answers, now we can engage in a
seemingly meaningful discussion about our problems with ChatGPT. Or, if you’re
in China, DeepSeek.

To some, though, it feels as if our ancestors knew more about life than we do.
Or at least, they knew how to look for them. And so it is that scores of young
Chinese are turning to ancient forms of divination to find out what the future
holds. In the past couple of years, fortune-telling bars have been popping up
in China’s cities, offering drinks and snacks alongside _xuanxue_ _,_ or
spiritualism. The trend makes sense: China’s economy is struggling, and
although consumers are saving their pennies, going out for a drink is cheaper
than other forms of retail therapy or an actual therapist. With a deep-rooted
culture of mysticism that blends Daoist, Buddhist and folk practices, which
have defied decades of the government trying to stamp out superstitious
beliefs, for many Chinese people, turning to the unseen makes perfect sense.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
