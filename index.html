Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected 2,475. The firm also said it expected
to deliver 10,300 to 10,700 homes in fiscal 2026. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg on average were expecting 10,843. The results “demonstrate that our
luxury business is differentiated, as we serve a more affluent customer who is
less impacted by affordability pressures,” CEO Doug Yearley said. He also
acknowledged “soft demand across many markets.” Bloomberg Intelligence Senior
Homebuilding Analyst Drew Reading joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to

            <p>Mark Carney is considering lifting a tanker ban that has protected coastal
communities for 53 years

The distress call went out to the Canadian coast guard station after midnight
on an October night. The Nathan E Stewart, an American-flagged tugboat,
sailing through the light winds and rain of the central British Columbia

Entering Printemps in downtown New York City feels like an escape. A slight
smell of musk hangs in the air as shoppers weave carefully around racks of
coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a
small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.

The French luxury retail emporium opened its first New York outlet earlier
this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels
like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along

            <p>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal
emails later revealed company’s influence

The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology has formally retracted a
sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for
Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate
don’t cause cancer.  
  
Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a note
accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious
ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors
of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies
presented”.

The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide
Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that
Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no
cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of
endocrine systems in people or animals.

that his was not at all about currying favor with Donald Trump.

“I don’t think this is in any way a partisan activity,” Dell told the New York

  * Business live – latest updates

Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, has been fined €120m (£105m) after it
was found in breach of new EU digital laws, in a ruling likely to put the
European Commission on a collision course with the US billionaire and
potentially Donald Trump.

The breaches, under consideration for two years, included what the EU said was
a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of
transparency of the platform’s advertising.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
