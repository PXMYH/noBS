her pocket money.

Smith-Turpin, 48, would spray herself with dewberry perfume – the scent of

trading over Christmas and new year.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Zyn, a kind of modern-day snuff, has developed a bro-y fandom on social media.
It’s also opened up a predictable divide

Don Juan, the 1655 five-act comedy by Molière, begins with a rhapsody on the
benefits of snuff: the pulverized tobacco product popularized in the courts
and salons of 17th-century Europe. “It’s the passion of the virtuous man,”
Molière’s rakish hero waxes. “Not only does it purge the human brain, but it
also instructs the soul in virtue and one learns from it how to be a virtuous
man.”

Don Juan’s ode to smokeless tobacco was consistent with similar ecstasies of
the era. The distinguished English scholar and encyclopedist Robert Burton
claimed tobacco went “far beyond all other panaceas, potable gold, and
philosopher’s stones, a sovereign remedy to all diseases”. Mark Twain, the
eminent American wit, once proclaimed: “If smoking is not allowed in heaven, I
shall not go.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
