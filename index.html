            <p>Dr Pepper took the No 2 spot behind Coca-Cola last year. But the latest US
sales figures don’t tell the whole story

This month, the astonishing news broke that, after more than a century of
pitched battle – including ad skirmishes, frantic marketing, and taste tests
on both Earth and in space – the cola wars were officially over. Coca-Cola had
always been the winner, but its longtime rival, Pepsi, was no longer No 2.
Instead, a new challenger had climbed into second place: Dr Pepper.

The coup de grace was delivered by Beverage Digest, an Atlanta-based trade
publication that, in late May, released an updated ranking of the top 10 US
carbonated soft drink brands in 2023 based on sales volume. There, at the top,
was Coca-Cola Classic, with a 19.2% volume share of the market, followed by Dr
Pepper, which squeaked by Pepsi, 8.34% to 8.31%. What a comedown for Pepsi,
which had enjoyed a 15% share back in the glory days of 1995.

Families of the victims of two Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes in Ethiopia and
Indonesia have demanded that the plane maker be criminally prosecuted and
fined $25bn for “the deadliest corporate crime in US history”.

In a letter to the US justice department, Paul Cassell, an attorney for 15
victims’ families, said that the amount is “legally justified and clearly
appropriate”, but could be significantly reduced if Boeing improved safety
standards and agreed to an independent monitor.

            <p>Isabella Weber, who linked corporate profits to inflation, shares how to
prevent food shortages – and price gouging

  * Tell us: how has inflation changed the way you grocery shop?

Isabella Weber, the economist who ignited controversy with a bold proposal to
implement strategic price controls at the peak of inflation and identified
corporate profits as a driver of high prices, has proposed a new measure that
could prevent food shortages and price gouging in the wake of another
disruption of the global supply chains.

Weber’s new paper, published on Thursday, looks at how grain prices spiked in
2022 as Covid snagged supply chains and Russia invaded Ukraine. The price
hikes helped to drive record profits for corporations while pushing inflation
higher and increasing global hunger. In the paper, Weber and colleagues call
for the creation of buffer stocks of grain that could be released during
shortages or emergencies to ease price pressures.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
