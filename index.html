            <p>Wall Street kicked off a pivotal week with the dollar climbing the most since
May as a tariff deal between President Donald Trump and the European Union
bolstered hopes for an extension of a China trade truce. The start of a week
that will set the tone for the rest of the year in markets saw a dollar gauge
up almost 1%, extending its July rally. The euro slid the most in over two
months. In the run-up to the Aug. 1 US tariff deadline, traders will go
through a raft of key data from jobs to inflation and economic activity. The
big event comes Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates
unchanged. Then there’s a string of big-tech earnings, with four megacaps
worth a combined $11.3 trillion reporting results. Nancy Lazar, Chief
Economist for Piper Sandler tells Bloomberg Businessweek that consumers
spending is going through a soft patch going into the third quarter as
businesses try to anticipate tariff cost increases. (Source: Bloomberg)

The Make America Healthy Again (Maha) movement celebrated this month after the

upon the food industry to stop using artificial dyes, and many of the nation’s
largest food manufacturers, including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, have
already promised to comply. But the ice-cream pledge made Kennedy especially
happy because, he said, ice-cream is his favorite food.

(£1.13bn) “decline in operating result primarily due to high costs from
increased US import tariffs”.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
