TikTok finds and homemade gifts, trips to the mall and the endless search for
“dupes” – gen Z’s shopping habits are shaking up retail in the run-up to
Christmas. And with price tags climbing and brand loyalty slipping, retailers
this season must work harder to earn this generation’s dollar.

Gen Z’s spending power is expected to near $12tn by 2030. But this year those
aged 13 to 28 are expected to cut their holiday spending by a whopping 23% – a
sharper decline compared to other generations – according to a recent PwC
report.

            <p>Will the bubble ravage the economy when it bursts? What will it leave of value
once it pops?

The California Gold Rush left an outsized imprint on America. Some 300,000
people flocked there from 1848 to 1855, from as far away as the Ottoman
Empire. Prospectors massacred Indigenous people to take the gold from their
lands in the Sierra Nevada mountains. And they boosted the economies of nearby
states and faraway countries from whence they bought their supplies.

Gold provided the motivation for California – a former Mexican territory then
controlled by the US military – to become a state with laws of its own. And
yet, few “49ers” as prospectors were known, struck it rich. It was the
merchants selling prospectors food and shovels who made the money. One, a
Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss who sold denim overalls to the gold bugs
passing through San Francisco, may be the most remembered figure of his day.

leaders have warned.

On Small Business Saturday, firms have their fingers crossed that strong

While the White House has tried to reduce concern, floating tariff-funded

            <p>Exclusive: It follows calls from US senator Elizabeth Warren to investigate
bank executives including ex-Barclays boss Jes Staley

US regulators say they are taking allegations that top banks may have
facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity “very seriously”, as they
faced calls to investigate executives including the former Barclays boss Jes
Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) said they had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator
Elizabeth Warren, which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the
convicted child sex offender Epstein.

national TV network’s license be revoked – even though it doesn’t work that
way

Facing aggressive questioning from Mary Bruce, an ABC News White House
correspondent, about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the Jeffrey Epstein
scandal, Donald Trump last week suggested a form of punishment he thought
would be appropriate for her “crappy company”: the Federal Communications
Commission should revoke ABC’s license, the US president declared.

It wasn’t the first time he has done so. As he has sought redress for what he
has considered to be unfair reporting about him and his administration, Trump
has suggested at least 28 times over the last eight years that a television
network should lose its license, according to analysis by the Guardian.

            <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say
they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their
contacts

Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution
offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant,
ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most
Admired Companies by the magazine, describes its financial advisers as “expert
listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after
goal”.

It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes
it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that
could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file
into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month
internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in
beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent
graduates themselves.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
