The EU’s ambassador to China has urged Beijing to stop building coal-fired
power plants, saying that its rapid approval of new projects was increasingly
at odds with its green ambitions.

Speaking at an EU-hosted event in Beijing, Jorge Toledo said the war in
Ukraine had underlined the need for energy security, but that the EU had
managed to navigate the issue without reverting to fossil fuels.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The Trump administration’s tariffs have sparked tension with co-hosts Canada
and Mexico. That’s bad news for a tournament that is supposed to unite nations

The start of the run-up to a World Cup is traditionally an upbeat affair. New
stadium launches, inclusion-friendly marketing and merch campaigns, the
unveiling of a tournament song or quirky mascot: these are the traditional
signals by which host nations announce that the big show is approaching. This
time, pre-tournament preparations are taking shape a little differently.
Thanks to Donald Trump and his determination to pursue economic armageddon
against the US’s co-hosts, Canada and Mexico, the tone for the 2026 World Cup
is being set not by Shakira or an anthropomorphic keffiyeh but by reciprocal
tariffs, a flurry of cross-border insults, and crumbling diplomatic relations
between the host nations. On Tuesday, Trump confirmed that the US will begin
imposing levies on most imports from Canada and Mexico; Canada immediately
retaliated, and Mexico looks set to follow. Welcome to the Trade War World
Cup; please tip your host 25% of the entrance fee on your way in. If things
continue on their current course, the 2026 tournament will be the first
installment of the World Cup to be co-hosted by the antagonists of an active
international economic conflict.

Whether things do in fact continue as they are is, of course, difficult to
predict: Trump’s approach to policy is famously erratic, and the protectionism
that marked his first administration was leavened by various exemptions and
carve-outs to the tariffs imposed on trading partners, a cycle of aggression
and moderation that could be repeated this time round. With the first match
still 15 months away, there’s plenty of time for the deterioration in
diplomatic relations between the co-hosts to give way to reconciliation. But
as things stand today, with Trump and his cabinet lackeys apparently hellbent
on trashing the global economy and humiliating traditional allies, that hope
seems pretty remote. The US – which is due to host 75% of the matches during
the 2026 tournament, and every fixture from the quarter-finals onwards – looks
set to steam into the approaching World Cup with a spirit of hospitality
roughly equivalent to Roy Keane sizing up Alf-Inge Haaland’s knee.

goals.

Last year in its proxy voting and engagement policy the company said that it
expected companies in its index funds to have boards with at least 30% female
directors. State Street warned that it might vote against the nominating
committee or the board leader if a company failed to meet the expectation.

Jeffrey Epstein deployed a consultant to push for Jes Staley to become
Barclays’ chief executive in 2012, a court was told on Tuesday, with the
ultimately failed campaign – called “Project Jes” – having planned to target
high-profile figures including the then chancellor, George Osborne, and the
then Bank of England governor, Mervyn King.

The campaign’s efforts were detailed as part of a landmark legal case launched
by Staley against the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Staley is trying to overturn its 2023 decision to ban him from taking senior
roles in the UK’s financial sector for having allegedly misled the regulator
over the depth of his relationship with the convicted sex offender Epstein.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
