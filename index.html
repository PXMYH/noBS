            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Ever since Elon Musk took over Twitter, I and many others have been looking
for alternatives. Who wants to share a platform with the likes of Andrew Tate
and Tommy Robinson?

I considered leaving Twitter as soon as Elon Musk acquired it in 2022, just
not wanting to be part of a community that could be bought, least of all by a
man like him – the obnoxious “long hours at a high intensity” bullying of his
staff began immediately. But I’ve had some of the most interesting
conversations of my life on there, both randomly, ambling about, and
solicited, for stories: “Anyone got catastrophically lonely during Covid?”;
“Anyone hooked up with their secondary school boy/girlfriend?” We used to call
it the place where you told the truth to strangers (Facebook was where you
lied to your friends), and that wide-openness was reciprocal and gorgeous.

It got more unpleasant after the blue-tick fiasco: identity verification
became something you could buy, which destroyed the trust quotient. So I
joined the rival platform Mastodon, but fast realised that I would never get
70,000 followers on there like I had on Twitter. It wasn’t that I wanted the
attention _per se,_ just that my gang wasn’t varied or noisy enough. There’s
something eerie and a bit depressing about a social media feed that doesn’t
refresh often enough, like walking into a shopping mall where half the shops
have closed down and the rest are all selling the same thing.

The trial into the “dieselgate” emissions scandal, which plunged Volkswagen
into disrepute nine years ago, has opened with the German carmaker’s former
chief executive appearing in the dock for the first time.

Volkswagen, widely viewed as a symbol of German economic success and technical
prowess, was found to have falsified emissions tests that made its vehicles
appear considerably more climate-friendly than they really were.

The Baltimore houses are in rough shape. They might be missing roofs, or even

David Lidz, founder of the Waterbottle Co-op, which rehabilitates the
foreclosed homes, points out, the contents are hard to view dispassionately.

“When a family leaves, most of the time they leave a ton of stuff there,” he

As gambling companies target social media users, the four leading online
brands appear to be routinely breaching the industry’s self-imposed marketing
regulations, according to a new study.

Over one week this summer, academics at the University of Bristol found that
BetMGM, DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel published more than a thousand posts
– 75% of their non-sponsored content on Facebook, Instagram, X and TikTok –
that did not include problem gambling support messages or a helpline number.

Police in southern Spain have thwarted the theft of almost half a tonne of
olives as the country’s harvest season begins and the lucrative fruit becomes
a tempting target for opportunistic thieves and professional criminal gangs.

The _verdeo_ – or collecting of the green olives – takes place in the early
autumn and marks the beginning of the harvest season. As it got under way in
Seville province this week, officers from Spain’s Guardia Civil force
prevented 465kg (73st 2lbs) of olives from being stolen near the town of
Albaida del Aljarafe.

Members of Brazil’s supreme court have unanimously voted to uphold the ban on
X, after Elon Musk’s refusal to comply with local laws led to the social
network being blocked in one of its biggest markets.

On Monday, five of the court’s justices were asked to consider Friday’s
decision to temporarily banish X from Brazil, where the platform has more than
21 million users. By lunchtime all five had voted in favour of the ban.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise has confirmed it will push ahead with a high court

is seeking damages of up to $4bn (£3bn).

The US company said in a statement it would follow the legal proceedings
“through to their conclusion” despite Lynch’s death last month when his yacht

Children under the age of two should not be exposed to any screens whatsoever
and teenagers should have no more than three hours of screen time a day,
according to guidelines announced by health authorities in Sweden.

Parents and guardians should think about how they use screens with their
children and tell them what they are doing on their phones when they use them
in their presence, the advice says.

Labor Day has come around again, and workers’ rights are now center stage in

in a dispute with rail firms. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are courting
union members as they fight for the White House even as union leaders call the
Republican nominee a union-busting “scab”.

These political efforts to appease, control and pacify the working class and
labor movements span human history as a new book argues that it is the first
book on the labor movement in the Roman empire.

I’ve never had a pumpkin spice latte. It’s not because I have anything against
the seasonal bestseller from Starbucks, which has become an unofficial herald
of the fall, I just don’t need the extra calories. A “grande” (16 oz) hot
pumpkin spice latte made with 2% milk has 390 calories – even more than a
Starbucks chocolate croissant (300), pumpkin cream cheese muffin (350), or
cinnamon coffee cake (380). That’s a lot of calories … for a “coffee”.

Clearly, I am in the minority. Heat warnings are sweeping the US, and yet
Starbucks has announced that it is already offering its fall menu – which
includes its pumpkin spice latte among other sweet and savory … coffees. And
the move has raised some eyebrows, due to the timing. Halloween drinks before
Labor Day? Is this what the world’s coming to?

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
