            <p>Woo Jin Ho, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Technology Analyst, joins Paul
Sweeney and Kristine Aquino on Bloomberg Intelligence to discuss the 2026
outlook for the PC and computer hardware market, including Micron, Dell, HP,
and more. AI is top of mind for these companies as server demand continues to
accelerate. Dell in particular is expected to see a broadening customer base
that will support a high-single-digit compound annual growth rate through
fiscal 2030. Robust AI order activity and stable traditional server and
storage trends will help sustain momentum. Elsewhere, Micron&#39;s 2026 DRAM-
supply outlook offers little relief for HP and Dell&#39;s PC sales and margin.
Micron expects DRAM-supply tightness at least through 2026 and into 2027,
which forces personal-computer manufacturers to make tradeoffs between PC
units and sales, especially at the higher end. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>US consumer sentiment rose in December by less than expected, remaining
depressed amid lingering affordability concerns. The University of Michigan’s
final December sentiment index climbed 1.9 points to 52.9, according to a
report released Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists called for a reading of 53.5. “Despite some signs of improvement to
close out the year, sentiment remains nearly 30% below December 2024, as
pocketbook issues continue to dominate consumer views of the economy,” Joanne
Hsu, director of the survey, said in a statement. The current conditions gauge
slid to a record-low of 50.4, while a gauge of expectations climbed to a four-
month high. Consumers’ perception of current buying conditions for big-ticket
items deteriorated to the lowest on record. Will Auchincloss, Americas Retail
Sector Leader at EY-Parthenon, breaks down the state of the consumer. (Source:

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>The US and its allies are renewing their push to hold a conference on Gaza
reconstruction, people familiar with the matter said, as the Trump
administration looks to inject fresh momentum into a ceasefire between Israel
and Hamas after a string of setbacks. Washington has been discussed as a
potential venue for the conference that could happen as early as next month,
according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private
conversations. Egypt is among several other locations also being considered,
one of the people said. That person said the event would probably take place
only after officials fill out the Board of Peace that will oversee a
transitional government and whose creation was spelled out in the ceasefire
that ended the fighting between Israel and Hamas and was signed in October.

            <p>Tashkent Supermarket’s new West Village location offers staples like _plov_
and _samsas_ hot and fresh – a taste of Central Asia for everyone

When I first stepped into the Tashkent Supermarket in Brighton Beach, I could
barely get around. The store was bustling, packed with the familiar unsmiling
faces of post-Soviet people eager to get their hands on foods like _manty_ –
intricately shaped dumplings filled with minced beef, onion and, depending on
where you’re from, pumpkin for the subtle sweetness. Or _chak-chak_ , a
dessert made of small pieces of fried golden dough held together by honey
syrup. _Kompot,_ too, a drink made by simmering seasonal or dried fruits.

Growing up in Kazakhstan, these were staples in school cafeterias and at home.
_Manty_ was one of the first dishes my mom taught me to make – I thought she
was a magician, the way she rolled the stretchy dough out so wide and thin,
yet thick enough to hold the filling without tearing. I was rarely allowed to
have soda or sugary drinks, but homemade _kompot_ with fruits and berries from
our garden was an exception. And though I never mastered _chak-chak_ , the
store-bought version was always a treat. As I got older and traveled across
other former Soviet republics, I found comfort in knowing I would always find
_plov_ and _samsas_ at eateries in Moscow, Baku and Tbilisi.

            <p>Weiss ought to cut her losses, green-light the piece, and try to start acting
like an editor – not like a cog in the machine of authoritarian politics and
oligarchy

One tries to give people the benefit of the doubt. But now, when it comes to
Bari Weiss as the editor in chief of CBS News, there is no longer any doubt.  
  
A broadcast-news neophyte, Weiss has no business in that exalted role. She
proved that beyond any remaining doubt last weekend, pulling a powerful and

of powerful, rich and influential people.

  * Business live – latest updates

Ryanair has been fined €256m (£223m) by Italy’s competition authority for
abusing its dominant market position to limit sales of tickets by online
travel agents.

The authority said Europe’s largest airline had “implemented an abusive
strategy to hinder travel agencies” via an “elaborate strategy” of technical
obstacles for agents and passengers to make it difficult for online travel
agents to sell Ryanair tickets and instead force sales through its own
website.

A group of the world’s top economists – including the Nobel prize winner
Joseph Stiglitz – have called for Sri Lanka’s debt payments to be suspended as
it tackles the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.

More than 600 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed
across the island, in what Sri Lanka’s president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake,
called the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”.

            <p>As Congress cuts healthcare access to pay for tax cuts and poor Americans die
earlier, billionaires invest in anti-ageing

There’s a weird disconnect to the public debate about health in the United
States. In January, millions of Americans may drop their health insurance as
premiums skyrocket following the Trump administration’s decision to end
federal subsidies that helped some 20 million people afford insurance on the
Obamacare marketplaces.

Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress agreed to cut more than $850bn from
the 10-year budgets of Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income
people, and the Chip health insurance program for children, in order to pay
for some tax cuts. Given the US’s budgetary rules, that cut means an
additional $500bn in funding for Medicare is at risk.

after a brief spell as FBI deputy director

After several failed attempts at elected office, Dan Bongino finally found
national acclaim as a pugilistic, bare-knuckle conservative media personality,
appearing as a contributor on Fox News before hosting an eponymous radio show
and podcast.

The Dan Bongino Show, which was hosted by Westwood One, ended abruptly earlier
this year when Bongino was plucked out of the conservative media-sphere by
another veteran pro-Maga podcaster, Kash Patel, and picked to serve as his
second-in-command at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
