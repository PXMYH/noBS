            <p>Since a new war broke out between Israel and the militant Palestinian group
Hamas on Oct. 7, the Lebanese militia Hezbollah has expressed solidarity with
Hamas through military action. It has fired missiles, mortars, rockets and
explosive drones into northern Israel almost daily, prompting Israel to
respond with its own fire. In late August, the fighting escalated, risking an
all-out war. Yet both Israel and Hezbollah have reasons to avoid a full-blown
conflict.

            <p>Kwadjo Owusu-Ansah hasn’t even promoted his latest line of brightly colored
helmets, but ‘the most amazing people are finding them’

It was a zipper that propelled Kwadjo Owusu-Ansah’s project into motion.
“There was a flannel shirt I made with bleach,” the self-taught fashion
designer recalls, “and I hand-sewed the zipper on to the back of the shirt. I
think I fell in love, because almost everything I make has a zipper now.” That
device, and Owusu-Ansah’s fixation on it, were the seeds of Animated People,
his brand of innovative streetwear.

Owusu-Ansah – who goes by the name DamnKojo professionally and works full time
in marketing at a wine and spirits company – sees his fashion line as less of
an up-and-coming label than an ongoing art project. “I want you to tell your
own story,” Owusu-Ansah, 31, says. “Make your own meaning with my art. Dissect
it. Think about it. Why is a dude wearing a miniskirt today? [I want people]
to question the pieces when they see them. That’s what starts a conversation.”

 **Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has said the US government under Joe Biden put
pressure on the Facebook social network to “censor certain Covid-19 content”
during the coronavirus pandemic.**

Zuckerberg said that “senior officials” from the White House “repeatedly
pressured our teams for months to censor certain Covid-19 content, including
humour and satire”, in a letter to the US House of Representatives’ judiciary
committee. He wrote:

I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not
more outspoken about it. I also think we made some choices that, with the
benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn’t make today.

            <!-- Summary -->

along the Hudson valley is fertile for the next tech boom

The “quantum chandelier” that sits within a glass box in the chapel at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s campus in Troy, New York, is the symbolic
centerpiece of an ambitious effort to turn upstate New York into an advanced
technology center – what Silicon Valley is to social media or Cambridge,
Massachusetts, is to biotech.

The silver sci-fi object, named for interior gold lattices that suspend, cool
and isolate its processor, is the heart of a “quantum computing system” that
could herald a new age of computing. It’s the centerpiece of the dream Curtis
Priem, a co-founder of Nvidia, the $2.8tn artificial intelligence hardware and

computing hub and refashioning this area of upstate New York into a new
Silicon Valley.

The Wu-Tang Clan spent six years creating Once Upon a Time in Shaolin before
putting a single copy of the 31-track double album up for auction in 2015 on

group wanted it viewed as a piece of contemporary art.

Canada, following the lead of the United States, on Monday said it would

announced a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum from China.

The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ottawa was acting to counter what he

            <p>Forget Hollywood depictions of gun-toting robots running wild in the streets –
the reality of artificial intelligence is far more dangerous, warns the
historian and author in an exclusive extract from his new book

Throughout history many traditions have believed that some fatal flaw in human
nature tempts us to pursue powers we don’t know how to handle. The Greek myth
of Phaethon told of a boy who discovers that he is the son of Helios, the sun
god. Wishing to prove his divine origin, Phaethon demands the privilege of
driving the chariot of the sun. Helios warns Phaethon that no human can
control the celestial horses that pull the solar chariot. But Phaethon
insists, until the sun god relents. After rising proudly in the sky, Phaethon
indeed loses control of the chariot. The sun veers off course, scorching all
vegetation, killing numerous beings and threatening to burn the Earth itself.
Zeus intervenes and strikes Phaethon with a thunderbolt. The conceited human
drops from the sky like a falling star, himself on fire. The gods reassert
control of the sky and save the world.

Two thousand years later, when the Industrial Revolution was making its first
steps and machines began replacing humans in numerous tasks, Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe published a similar cautionary tale titled The Sorcerer’s
Apprentice. Goethe’s poem (later popularised as a Walt Disney animation
starring Mickey Mouse) tells of an old sorcerer who leaves a young apprentice
in charge of his workshop and gives him some chores to tend to while he is
gone, such as fetching water from the river. The apprentice decides to make
things easier for himself and, using one of the sorcerer’s spells, enchants a
broom to fetch the water for him. But the apprentice doesn’t know how to stop
the broom, which relentlessly fetches more and more water, threatening to
flood the workshop. In panic, the apprentice cuts the enchanted broom in two
with an axe, only to see each half become another broom. Now two enchanted
brooms are inundating the workshop with water. When the old sorcerer returns,
the apprentice pleads for help: “The spirits that I summoned, I now cannot rid
myself of again.” The sorcerer immediately breaks the spell and stops the
flood. The lesson to the apprentice – and to humanity – is clear: never summon
powers you cannot control.

Many Australian businesses are feeling the pinch as customers can no longer
afford the armchairs, gadgets, clothing brands and new bathrooms they could
before the cost of living shot up.

But spending patterns remain uneven, and at times counterintuitive, leading to
a mixed corporate earnings season marked by subdued but not collapsing demand.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
