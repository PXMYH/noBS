being followed’ after analysis of social media posts by leading firms

As gambling companies target social media users, the four leading online
brands appear to be routinely breaching the industry’s self-imposed marketing
regulations, according to a new study.

Over one week this summer, academics at the University of Bristol found that
BetMGM, DraftKings, ESPN Bet and FanDuel published more than a thousand posts

lucrative fruit a tempting target for criminals

Police in southern Spain have thwarted the theft of almost half a tonne of
olives as the country’s harvest season begins and the lucrative fruit becomes
a tempting target for opportunistic thieves and professional criminal gangs.

The _verdeo_ – or collecting of the green olives – takes place in the early
autumn and marks the beginning of the harvest season. As it got under way in
Seville province this week, officers from Spain’s Guardia Civil force
prevented 465kg (73st 2lbs) of olives from being stolen near the town of
Albaida del Aljarafe.

            <p>Guidelines also stipulate teenagers should have no more than three hours of
screen time a day

Children under the age of two should not be exposed to any screens whatsoever
and teenagers should have no more than three hours of screen time a day,
according to guidelines announced by health authorities in Sweden.

Parents and guardians should think about how they use screens with their
children and tell them what they are doing on their phones when they use them
in their presence, the advice says.

– much like labor organizing today

Labor Day has come around again, and workers’ rights are now center stage in
North America. Canadian railworkers nearly brought trade to a juddering halt
in a dispute with rail firms. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are courting
union members as they fight for the White House even as union leaders call the
Republican nominee a union-busting “scab”.

These political efforts to appease, control and pacify the working class and
labor movements span human history as a new book argues that it is the first
book on the labor movement in the Roman empire.

Thousands of US hotel workers went on strike on Sunday for improved pay and
conditions in a dispute likely to disrupt many Labor Day weekend holiday
travelers, amid union warnings that industrial action could escalate.

More than 10,000 workers walked off the job at hotels in Boston, Seattle,
Honolulu, Kauai and Greenwich, Connecticut, as well as the Californian cities
of San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose after contract talks with the
establishments’ owners collapsed.

I’ve never had a pumpkin spice latte. It’s not because I have anything against
the seasonal bestseller from Starbucks, which has become an unofficial herald
of the fall, I just don’t need the extra calories. A “grande” (16 oz) hot
pumpkin spice latte made with 2% milk has 390 calories – even more than a
Starbucks chocolate croissant (300), pumpkin cream cheese muffin (350), or
cinnamon coffee cake (380). That’s a lot of calories … for a “coffee”.

Clearly, I am in the minority. Heat warnings are sweeping the US, and yet
Starbucks has announced that it is already offering its fall menu – which
includes its pumpkin spice latte among other sweet and savory … coffees. And
the move has raised some eyebrows, due to the timing. Halloween drinks before
Labor Day? Is this what the world’s coming to?

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
