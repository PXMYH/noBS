            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>I spent entire nights in 2011 gabbing on Skype. As it shutters, I’m reminded
of a bygone era of online intimacy

I doubt many people are mourning the demise of Skype. The sky-blue platform
that revolutionized the video call, _the_ medium for long-distance
relationships in the early 2010s, had not been relevant for almost a decade
when Microsoft announced its impending death. My own relationship with Skype’s
clunky tangle of video, voice and chat peaked in 2011 – the same year
Microsoft purchased it for a headline-making $8.5bn, only to let it wither in
the shadow of professionalized, less-pixelated options. By 2014, it was
basically obsolete, as video calls shifted to more integrated apps like
FaceTime, and my college schedule did not allow for glitchy, hours-long
catchups. Snapchat was far more efficient.

Like most people, I barely touched Skype from the mid-2010s on; the news that
Microsoft will shutter it on 4 May and fold its data into the free version of
Teams prompted me to log back in for the first time in five years. All that
remained of my formerly thriving Skype life – once a log of video calls picked
up and put down, peppered with chats pleading to “pleaseeeeeeee call me back
bitchhhh (:” – were a handful of spam crypto chats and phishing links from
former favorites who had long quit the platform, as well.

When screenwriter David Scarpa visits the great Hollywood studios these days,
he is struck by what is missing. “It used to be you’d walk around those back

            <p>First penalties under landmark Digital Markets Act are fines of €500m to Apple
and €200m to Facebook owner

The European Commission has fined Apple €500m (£429m) and Meta €200m for
breaking rules on fair competition and user choice, in the first penalties
issued under one of the EU’s landmark internet laws.

The fines under the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is intended to ensure
fair business practices by tech companies, are likely to provide another
flashpoint with Donald Trump’s administration, which has fiercely attacked

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
