$500m for an upgrade. But Trump’s running mate calls shifting the US to

A hulking steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, is the city’s economic heartbeat as
well as a keystone origin story of JD Vance, the hometown senator now running
to be Donald Trump’s vice-president.

Its future, however, may hinge upon $500m in funding from landmark climate
legislation that Vance has called a “scam” and is a Trump target for
demolition.

cosmetics. Amid the aromatic resin sheathed under glass, there are various
anti-ageing serums, creams, perfumes and essences.

At one counter, a sales assistant is advising customers on how much essential
oil to add to a nebuliser to make guests feel relaxed “without overwhelming
them”. Another explains frankincense’s moisturising properties, including its
alleged ability to smooth out fine lines caused by smiling and squinting. In
terms of popularity, she says, it now far outstrips other botanicals.

Big tech has made some big claims about greenhouse gas emissions in recent

demands, it’s getting hard for the industry to hide the true costs of the data
centers powering the tech revolution.

According to a Guardian analysis, from 2020 to 2022 the real emissions from
the “in-house” or company-owned data centers of Google, Microsoft, Meta and
Apple are likely about 662% – or 7.62 times – higher than officially reported.

Analysts have included a reduction in the cost of borrowing by the US central

The menu at Maeve’s Place, a cozy coffee shop nestled in the Catskill
mountains, is far more extensive than that of your traditional java joint. On
offer are eggs any style you wish, a range of pastries and eight types of mac
and cheese. The kitchen isn’t the main point, though.

Iva Walsh, a single mother of four who immigrated to the US from the Czech
Republic in the late 1980s, opened the upstate New York establishment in 2018
to provide work opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Her roster of nine employees includes her 26-year-old daughter, after whom the
business is named. Walsh’s son, Daniel Hellmayer, a 41-year-old Culinary
Institute of America graduate, works at the cafe as a full-time chef.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
