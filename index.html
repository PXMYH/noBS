            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas and the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks

keep fighting until all the hostages seized by Hamas are free. President Joe
Biden said he’s sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel as part of
efforts end the war with Hamas. Meanwhile Biden has arrived in Germany on a
swan-song tour ahead of the US election, to strengthen the transatlantic
relationship and double down on assistance to war-torn Ukraine. Today&#39;s

environment’ amid strikes and safety concerns

Boeing is seeking to raise up to $25bn (£19bn) in an attempt to shore up its
finances as the planemaker struggles with production delays amid a strike by
33,000 workers and ongoing safety concerns.

A regulatory filing by the company on Tuesday said it intended to raise the
money through a stock and debt offering, which would provide flexibility for
Boeing to seek options to support its balance sheet over a three-year period.

Climate campaigners have asked the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission to investigate whether “fly carbon neutral” and other
sustainability claims by Qantas are misleading or deceptive.

The greenwashing complaint, filed by the Environmental Defenders Office on
behalf of research and advocacy organisation Climate Integrity, urged the
competition watchdog to investigate the airline’s marketing materials and the
credibility of the company’s transition to net zero.

  * Business live – latest updates

The EU’s plans to ban the manufacture of traditional combustion engines from
2035 will shrink the industry, BMW’s chief executive has warned as the German
car industry battles with increased competition from China in the electric
vehicle sector.

In a comment that will alarm Brussels, Oliver Zipse told the Paris motor show

Taiwan is expected to have access to low earth orbit satellite internet
service by the end of the month, a step the government says is crucial in case
a Chinese attack cripples the island’s communications.

The forthcoming service is via a contract between Taiwan’s main telecoms
company, Chunghwa, and a UK-European company, Eutelsat OneWeb, signed last

vulnerabilities, particularly its internet access, after attempts to get
access to Elon Musk’s Starlink service collapsed.

want their homes protected against flooding.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
