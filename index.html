The Wall Street firm said it spent $4.2bn (£3.2bn) on compensation and

  * Business live – latest updates

Burberry has warned again on profits and ousted its chief executive, as the
struggling British luxury fashion brand announced a change of direction to
“reconnect” with core customers.

In an unscheduled trading update on Monday, Burberry said Jonathan Akeroyd was
leaving the company with immediate effect and “by mutual agreement with the
board”. It comes less than three years after the former Versace boss was
appointed in 2021.

As Donald Trump prepares to make his economic pitch to the nation, economists
have warned that key parts of his policy platform – including steep tariffs
and sweeping tax cuts – would probably increase inflation and strain the US’s
finances.

The Trump campaign will set out plans to “make America wealthy again” as
Republicans gather in Milwaukee on Monday for the first day of the party’s
convention.

            <p>Running your own company is full of stress, frustration and headaches. But
most owners wouldn’t have it any other way

Some 91% of the 1,290 business owners recently surveyed by the employee
scheduling software maker Homebase said that they were happy with their jobs.
Who are these happy people? And why are they so darned happy?

It’s not the small business story we usually hear. The National Federation of
Independent Businesses says small business owners’ optimism has been below
average for 29 months and their uncertainty is the highest it’s been since
2020. Small businesses are “struggling” to make rent and “racking up” credit
card debt. Many are “facing recession”, some say they “can’t survive” and
others say they’re “feeling the pinch” or “stuck in an economic nightmare”.

OpenAI whistleblowers have urged the US financial watchdog to investigate non-
disclosure agreements at the startup after claiming the contracts included
restrictions such as requiring employees to seek permission before contacting
regulators.

Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) typically bar an employee from sharing
company information with outside parties but a group of whistleblowers are
arguing that OpenAI’s agreements could have led to workers being punished for
raising concerns about the company to federal authorities.

            <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics releases latest estimate of how much labor receives
of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
