            <p>US recession fears and unwinding yen ‘carry trade’ hits markets, wiping 12%
off Japan’s Nikkei

  * Fears of further market turmoil deepen after US economic data spooked investors
  * Asian stock markets tumble after US data fans recession fears

 **August is often a weak month for the markets; liquidity is often lower, as
investors in the northern hemisphere head off on holiday.**

This means the recent worrying US economic data could have a greater impact.

Markets were on edge before Friday but a weak payrolls has really escalated a
profound move across the globe.

However the reality is that although payrolls was disappointing it’s hard to
know how disappointing given the distortions from Hurricane Beryl.

For the last decade plus the FOMO driven “ _stocks have risen because they are
rising_ ” mindset has been the biggest momentum driver in markets – an upside
cattle-prod combining fervid speculation with the ongoing distortions of
mispriced money, artificially low interest rates, QE and expensive govt bonds,
the financialisation of businesses, in a market seduced by a stream of
fantabulous new, new things and greater than normal unbounded greed.

            <p>Cracks in labour market provide Trump with evidence for his message that Biden
has been disaster for the economy

  * Business live – latest updates

Donald Trump’s message to US voters has been consistent as he seeks to win a
second term in the White House: the economy under Joe Biden has been a
disaster.

Until recently the hard data has not supported Trump’s argument. The US has
been comfortably the fastest-growing of the G7 leading industrial nations
since the Covid pandemic. Unemployment has been low by historic standards.

Donald Trump proclaimed he was for “all the forgotten men and women”, in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention. His vice-presidential pick JD
Vance consistently portrays himself as a pro-worker populist. But an analysis
of the labor chapter of Project 2025 – an ambitious rightwing plan to guide
the next Republican presidency – found it has little to offer them.

Project 2025’s labor section proposes hardly anything to improve workers’
wages and working conditions. It is, however, chock full of recommendations

about 400m shares worth $84.2bn as of 30 June.

            <p>Sam Altman’s ChatGPT promises to transform the global economy. But it also
poses an enormous threat. Here, a scientist who appeared with Altman before
the US Senate on AI safety flags up the danger in AI – and in Altman himself

optimistic billionaire CEO, and I stood in front of the US Senate judiciary
subcommittee meeting on AI oversight. We were in Washington DC, and it was at
the height of AI mania. Altman, then 38, was the poster boy for it all.

Raised in St Louis, Missouri, Altman was the Stanford dropout who had become
the president of the massively successful Y Combinator startup incubator
before he was 30. A few months before the hearing, his company’s product
ChatGPT had taken the world by storm. All through the summer of 2023, Altman
was treated like a Beatle, stopping by DC as part of a world tour, meeting
prime ministers and presidents around the globe. US Senator Kyrsten Sinema
gushed: “I’ve never met anyone as smart as Sam… He’s an introvert and shy and
humble… But… very good at forming relationships with people on the Hill and…
can help folks in government understand AI.” Glowing portraits at the time
painted the youthful Altman as sincere, talented, rich and interested in
nothing more than fostering humanity. His frequent suggestions that AI could
transform the global economy had world leaders salivating.

After years of global growth, the luxury industry is facing a new foe:
“underconsumption”. On TikTok #underconsumptioncore emerges as a trending
topic, as the next generation of potential shoppers swap tips on how to look
good while buying and spending less. The entire sector is struggling as
consumers wince at luxury prices, and are left bemused by the rapid turnaround
of designers.

Last week, shares in Kering, owner of luxury labels including Gucci,
Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, hit a seven-year low
after reporting that operating income in the second half of the year would be
down 30% after a 42% drop in the first half.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come here because we are here. This is our island,”
Björklund, a co-owner of a restaurant and distillery on the archipelago, says
she told her friend. Sure enough, she was right.

In the back yard of the federal police headquarters in Roraima, the
northernmost state of Brazil, giant sacks lie strewn and overflowing with a
jet-black, gravel-like mineral: cassiterite. Although less high-profile than
other items seized during a crackdown on illegal mining in this Amazon state –
including a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter painted in the colours of the Brazilian
flag – cassiterite has become so sought-after that it is nicknamed “black
gold”.

Cassiterite is the chief ore of tin, a less heralded but critical mineral for
the energy transition. It is used in coatings for solar panels, lithium-ion
batteries and solder for electronics, including wind turbines, mobile phones,
computers and industrial alloys.

of national income, showing bleak decline

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

            <p>Exclusive: most renters surveyed by Harris Poll say the areas they live in
have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
