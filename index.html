            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Graphic sexual content, bullying, abuse and threats of violence are rife in
the metaverse – and the NSPCC says a huge proportion of online grooming
offences take place on Meta-owned products. Is it too late to change course?

Everybody knows that young women are not safe. They are not safe in the
street, where 86% of those aged 18 to 24 have experienced sexual harassment.
They are not safe at school, where 79% of young people told Ofsted that sexual
assault was common in their friendship groups and almost a third of 16- to
18-year-old girls report experiencing “unwanted sexual touching”. They are not
safe in swimming pools or parks, or at the beach. They are not even safe
online, with the children’s safety charity the NSPCC reporting that social
media sites are “failing to protect girls from harm at every stage”.

This will come as no surprise to any woman who has ever used social media. But
it is particularly relevant as Meta, the operator of some of the biggest
social platforms on the internet, is busily engaged in constructing a whole
new world. The company is pumping billions of dollars a year into building its
metaverse, a virtual world that it hopes will become the future not just of
socialising, but of education, business, shopping and live events. This raises
a simple question: if Meta has utterly failed to keep women and girls safe in
its existing online spaces, why should we trust it with the future?

it was “minimal”.

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
