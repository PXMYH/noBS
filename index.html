            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>In the past four decades, Uniqlo has refined the art of getting people to buy
clothes. Step into any store and you’ll find perfectly folded garments, color
palettes that shift from light to dark, pulling shoppers deeper into the
space, and sizes following a vertical logic, with smaller pieces within easy
reach and larger ones on higher shelves. That streamlined retail aesthetic,
along with a deep supply chain delivering quality shirts, pants and outerwear
at compelling prices, has allowed Tadashi Yanai, the CEO of Uniqlo parent
company Fast Retailing Co., to build an enormous business with $22.9 billion
in annual revenue from 26 markets. Only Inditex SA, the company behind Zara,
brings in more, but Yanai intends to eclipse his Spanish rival by tripling
sales in the coming years. Bloomberg News Senior Editor Reed Stevenson joins
Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. He speaks with Alexis Christoforous

More than 600 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed

called the “largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history”.

            <p>As Congress cuts healthcare access to pay for tax cuts and poor Americans die
earlier, billionaires invest in anti-ageing

There’s a weird disconnect to the public debate about health in the United
States. In January, millions of Americans may drop their health insurance as
premiums skyrocket following the Trump administration’s decision to end
federal subsidies that helped some 20 million people afford insurance on the
Obamacare marketplaces.

Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress agreed to cut more than $850bn from
the 10-year budgets of Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income
people, and the Chip health insurance program for children, in order to pay
for some tax cuts. Given the US’s budgetary rules, that cut means an
additional $500bn in funding for Medicare is at risk.

After several failed attempts at elected office, Dan Bongino finally found
national acclaim as a pugilistic, bare-knuckle conservative media personality,
appearing as a contributor on Fox News before hosting an eponymous radio show
and podcast.

The Dan Bongino Show, which was hosted by Westwood One, ended abruptly earlier
this year when Bongino was plucked out of the conservative media-sphere by
another veteran pro-Maga podcaster, Kash Patel, and picked to serve as his
second-in-command at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

  * The maps that show how China’s military is squeezing Taiwan

The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to
Taiwan valued at more than $10bn that includes medium-range missiles,
howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.

The state department announced the sales late on Wednesday during a nationally
televised address by president Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign
policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. US-Chinese
tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade
and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan,
which Beijing has said must unify with the People’s Republic of China.

A who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are
forcing through a proposal for a huge datacenter in rural Michigan as locals
from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one
calling it “uniquely evil”.

Residents of Saline Township, Michigan, fear the $7bn center would jack up
energy bills, pollute groundwater and destroy the area’s rural character. The
1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help
derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.

eight months amid a slowdown in food prices, clearing the way for the Bank of
England to cut interest rates on Thursday.

In a crunch week for the economy, the Office for National Statistics said the
rate as measured by the consumer prices index eased to 3.2% last month from a
reading of 3.6% in October. City economists had forecast a modest drop to
3.5%.

the tech giant’s armor.

            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
