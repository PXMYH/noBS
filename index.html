            <p>For 118 days, Hollywood actors were striking for a better deal and now there
is a tentative end in sight

The longest work stoppage for film and television actors is all but over, as
the Sag-Aftra union announced a tentative deal with studios to end a months-
long strike on Wednesday night. The deal, which will end the 118-day strike
that ground Hollywood to a halt and caused considerable financial pain for the
nearly 2 million Americans who work in jobs directly or indirectly related to
production, was hailed by union leadership as well as the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) as a historic breakthrough, with
notable agreements on minimum pay, streaming-based bonuses and consent and
compensation guarantees for the use of AI likenesses.

Overall, the actors union, like the writers union a month before it, secured
major concessions from studios – a “capitulation by Hollywood’s biggest
companies”, as the New York Times reported, and a stark reversal for studio
heads who assumed the unions would be “relatively compliant” in reaching a
deal.

AstraZeneca is making a big push into the weight-loss drug market, striking an

cardiometabolic conditions such as heart disease and stroke. Obesity and
diabetes affect more than 1 billion people globally. Eccogene will receive up
to $2bn (£1.6bn) under the terms of the deal.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>After four months, the Sag-Aftra film and television union has reached a
tentative deal, but we may be waiting a while for the art itself to triumph

It’s over. The stream of sweatshirted and placard-wielding Instagram no-
filter/no-makeup posts from stars is at an end. The Sag-Aftra film and
television actors’ strike in Hollywood is paused after four months, with a
tentative deal giving actors larger minimum-pay increases, a streaming bonus
and “consent and compensation” provisions against AI, although how exactly
this last is to be enforced remains to be seen. For those who had thought of
Hollywood as the very epitome of free-marketeerism, the spectacle of an actual
strike, which remained reasonably popular and un-demonised in the press, and
which produced a result, is quite startling. Especially as British Equity
doesn’t have this kind of power.  
  
In the movies themselves, from Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront to Sylvester
Stallone in FIST to Peter Sellers’ Hitler-moustached shop steward Fred Kite in
I’m All Right Jack, there is a long tradition of showing unions and union
activity as dramatically compromised. The closing scene of Sergei Eisenstein’s
Strike shows the workers being collectively shot, interspersed with images of
a cow being slaughtered. But today’s Hollywood cow is in pretty good shape,
despite rumours that studios have been using the strike as a cover to make
production cuts.  
  
But what does it mean for the moviegoing public? Well, not perhaps all that
much immediately, unlike the writers’ strike in the US where talkshows were
suspended and Drew Barrymore was criticised for breaking the strike by
attempting to restart her show. Production can reportedly recommence on titles
such as Deadpool 3, Gladiator 2 and Wicked which had been stymied, and a
release can be scheduled for delayed films including Dune: Part Two – but the
unblocking of all these sequels and adaptations does not on the face of it
seem like a reflowering of creativity or “storytelling” which industry honchos
solemnly declare to be their vocation.  
  
Striking Hollywood actors had been forbidden to make promotional appearances,
which had meant not appearing on talkshows. Perhaps British TV audiences for
The Graham Norton Show or The Jonathan Ross Show might not have noticed any
great difference, but we have seen a greater emphasis on non-film-promo
celebrity turns: Arnold Schwarzenegger has been around to boost his self-help
book and Dame Judi Dench her work on Shakespeare. And we have been spared that
most depressing of phenomena – the group appearance, whereby three or four
people from the same film sit grinningly on the sofa and hog all the limelight
and turn the programme into an advertorial for their film.  
  
But during the strike, Hollywood stars had been allowed to put their heads
over the parapet on the understanding that they were doing so as producers,
and film festival selectors had reportedly gone easier on movie stars’
“passion projects” on the understanding that they would be allowed to make a
red-carpet appearance as producers. This was surely the case with Chris Pine
and his wacky, sub-Lebowski film Poolman this year, in which he was director,
star, co-writer and co-producer – and which had people at the London film
festival groaning and checking the time on their phones. The strike had given
oxygen to Chris Pine and Poolman which should maybe have been withheld. The
end of the strike will mean business (almost) as usual: streamers and studios
will have drawn in their horns; performers will be encouraged to stay in their
lanes, but with the knowledge that this is still a really lucrative industry –
and actors have triumphantly restaked their claim in it.

In stark contrast to her father’s often angry performance on the stand just
two days earlier, Ivanka Trump was calm and amiable. Her brothers, Donald

“I don’t recall,” Ivanka Trump repeatedly told a New York court on Wednesday
as she took the witness stand at her father’s $250m fraud trial and was
quizzed about deals prosecutors claim prove the Trump Organization knowingly
misled lenders.

Trump’s eldest daughter gave an orderly, calm performance after the often
chaotic testimony of her father and brothers. She pointed out that she had not
worked for the family firm since 2017 and said she did not recall many
specific conversations but added: “I have no reason to doubt it.”

            <p>Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to
women, especially women of color

In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a
problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing
retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend
contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well
through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor
meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his
San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo
created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively
to women, particularly women of color.

“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo
said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for
a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that
surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to
experience that too.”

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
