for sugar-frosted Pop-Tarts. Starting in early November, pop-tart maker
Kellanova will offer a version of the sprinkle-strewn toaster pastries with
the kind of higher protein content reserved for what are typically considered
healthier foods. This follows PepsiCo Inc.’s plans for a higher-protein
version of Doritos. Elsewhere, protein is being added to popcorn, pasta,
bread, cookie dough, ice cream and macaroni and cheese. The trend shows how
packaged-food companies are betting that protein can lure back shoppers who
have moved away from highly processed products. Bloomberg News Food Industry

The swish seafront hotels and freshly planted palms on the gleaming promenade
might tempt any unwary holidaymaker to book in for Mallorca’s Calviá beach.
But step out the back door and the resort is still firmly, as it is better
known, Magaluf: boozed-up Britain in Spain, with cocktails by the pint.

Mallorca got most of the Balearics’ 3.5 million UK visitors last year: for
some residents, far too many. The island has become emblematic of the most

The government shutdown may have prevented the publication of September’s job
report, but we can be reasonably confident that when the numbers are known,
they will further underscore the Trump administration’s policy incoherence and
remind us of all of the damage he is prepared to inflict on the American
economy.

The president will most likely be apoplectic over data confirming that the
economy is generating very few new jobs (the payroll processor ADP estimated a
loss of 32,000 private sector jobs in September). Trump fired the head of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs numbers, after a
lackluster report published in August.

At the Purfeerst farm in southern Minnesota, the soybean harvest just wrapped
up for the season. The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of
soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece.

This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods
depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck
in the middle of a trade war between the US and China, the biggest purchaser
of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs.

The chance of the US stock market crashing is far greater than many financiers

Jamie Dimon, who is the chair and chief executive of the giant Wall Street
bank JPMorgan Chase, said he was “far more worried than others” about a
serious market correction, which he predicted could come in the next six
months to two years.

A small flotilla of gaily coloured fishing boats line the shingle beach at
Hastings, East Sussex. Behind them are the bulldozers that shunt them into the
waves and beyond, in neat rows, are black wooden fishermen’s huts and fish
stalls, where on a good day teenage daughters, wives and retired skippers sell
some of the day’s catch.

This is the Stade, a Saxon word for “landing place” from where wooden boats
have set off since before William the Conqueror arrived in 1066.

family-run firms in the line of fire as well

“It’s a real pity,” laments Antonio Rummo of Donald Trump’s latest target in
his ever-evolving tariff war: Italian pasta. Rummo is the sixth-generation
grandson of the founder of Pasta Rummo, who opened a wheat mill in Benevento
in southern Italy in 1846, using the family’s three horses to lug grain from
the surrounding Campania region and Puglia to produce fresh pasta.

“Demand for premium pasta in the US has been growing,” says Rummo. Appreciated
by consumers for a traditional processing method that guarantees it will cook
to _al dente_ perfection, sales of Pasta Rummo have been thriving.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that
could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus
fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw
material.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
