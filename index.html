Vasos who pocketed $183m between 2015 and 2021

Change to Win Federation, pointed out that the median salary for a Dollar
General employee in 2023 was $18,657 annually, or over $9 an hour, while
Dollar General’s CEO, Todd Vasos, received nearly $183m in compensation from

More than 10,500 of London’s black-cab drivers have launched a £250m legal
case against Uber, accusing it of breaking the capital’s taxi booking rules
and deliberately misleading authorities to secure a licence.

The case, which has been filed in the high court in London by the litigation
management firm RGL, resurrects a claim first raised five years ago, related
to the way the ride-hailing app operated in London between 2012 and 2018.

            <p>Experts say only ‘handful of plants’ operating with the dirtiest fuel will
likely survive, and only Trump and lawsuits could save them

New climate rules imposed by Joe Biden’s administration requiring huge cuts in
carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants will accelerate the decline of
an industry that until recently provided most of America’s power, experts say,
potentially even dealing a death blow to coal in the US.

Coal, once the backbone of the US economy and feted by Donald Trump as he rose
to the presidency, is being driven out of the power sector by cheaper
renewables and gas and now faces an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
regulation, finalized last week, that demands all coal plants not retiring by
2039 to slash their carbon emissions 90% within the coming decade.

The legal battle between Australia’s online safety regulator and Elon Musk’s X
is shaping up as the first true test of the power governments can wield over
tech platforms, not just within Australia but globally.

There have been skirmishes between Musk and the eSafety commissioner, Julie
Inman Grant, before. But tensions rose in the aftermath of the stabbing of
bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel on 15 April while he was giving a livestreamed
service at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church in the Sydney suburb
of Wakeley.

            <p>The British brand has entered the booming market in luxury ‘car-chitecture’,
opening a themed tower in Miami boasting ballroom, helipad and infinity pool –
all offering millionaires a perfect view of our choking, collapsing world

Move over, James Bond – a new Aston Martin has rolled into town, brimming with
more flashy features than Q could ever dream of. Parked ostentatiously on the
Miami waterfront, overlooking a private marina brimming with superyachts, its
streamlined flanks glisten in the Florida sunshine, housing an interior
trimmed with the finest leathers and exotic wood veneers. There’s no ejector
seat or rocket-launcher, but it is the biggest Aston Martin ever made –
housing Jacuzzi, bar, cinema, golf simulator, art gallery, ballroom and
infinity pool, all crowned with a 66th-storey helipad.

Unveiled in the week of the Miami Grand Prix, the latest exclusive model from
the timeless British automotive brand is not a high-performance sports car,
but an ultra-luxury apartment building – the tallest residential tower in the
US, south of New York. After Aston Martin’s years of financial woes, following
a disastrous stock market performance since the company’s 2018 listing, it
seems that the boutique car-  
maker is seeking salvation in property development.

As protests against Israel’s offensive in Gaza are spreading throughout

divestment from Israel.

Universities rely on endowments to fund things like research and scholarships,
and those endowments are typically invested in companies and alternative asset
classes, such as private equity and hedge funds.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
