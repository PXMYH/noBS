stretch for miles inside the mountains of Pataz, a gold-rich Andean province
about 130 miles (200km) inland from Peru’s third city, Trujillo. In early May,

Donald Trump said he will be negotiating his signature tax bill after Elon
Musk publicly criticised the president’s spending plan, saying it “undermines”
cost-cutting efforts that the world’s richest man once spearheaded.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged the bill “needs to get
a lot of support” in Congress, adding “we have to get a lot of votes”. The
president also said he was “not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m

Last spring, Carmelo Mendez was pruning peach trees in Colorado on a temporary

immigration policies change rapidly, farmers and workers alike are uncertain
about their future.

Americans’ views of the economy improved in May after five straight months of

As a Republican state lawmaker for 16 years, a Texas rancher and a staunch
supporter of Donald Trump, John Davis’s conservative credentials are
impeccable. But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an
increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US –
clean energy development.

Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling

opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is
one of the poorest counties in Texas.

Drastic cuts at a federal workplace safety research agency increase the risk
of illness and injury for workers across the US and undermine preparations for
public health emergencies, fired employees warn.

The Trump administration ordered widespread layoffs at the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, inside the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, when it issued a “reduction in force” notice to some 85% of the
agency’s 1,100 workers employees on 1 April.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
