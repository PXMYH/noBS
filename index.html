The Body Shop has filed for bankruptcy in the US and Canada and is struggling
to pay suppliers in Australia as the group’s most profitable overseas
businesses struggle with cash shortages after its UK parent’s collapse last
month.

The US arm of the ethical cosmetics group has ceased trading at its 50
outlets. On Saturday, it filed for Chapter 7 insolvency, under which assets
are sold off to clear debts, putting about 400 jobs at risk including those in

            <p>Trader Joe’s and SpaceX are among businesses challenging the constitutionality
of the National Labor Relations Board

Upset by the surge in union drives, several of the best-known corporations in
the US are seeking to cripple the country’s top labor watchdog, the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB), by having it declared unconstitutional. Some
labor experts warn that if those efforts succeed, US labor relations might
return to “the law of the jungle”.

In recent weeks, Elon Musk’s SpaceX as well as Amazon, Starbucks and Trader
Joe’s have filed legal papers that advance novel arguments aimed at hobbling
and perhaps shutting down the NLRB – the federal agency that enforces labor
rights and oversees unionization efforts. Those companies are eager to thwart
the NLRB after it accused Amazon, Starbucks and Trader Joe’s of breaking the
law in battling against unionization and accused SpaceX of illegally firing
eight workers for criticizing Musk.

The day after OpenAI launched in December 2015, its co-founder Sam Altman sat
down with Vanity Fair to discuss what the magazine described as “a non-profit
company to save the world from a dystopian future”. Altman talked up his
vision for keeping artificial intelligence safe and distributing it widely, as

Leftwing extremists have claimed responsibility for a dawn arson attack on an
electricity pylon at the Tesla car factory in Berlin, which bosses said would
halt production until the end of the week.

In a 2,500-word letter released on Tuesday, the Vulkan (volcano) activist
group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the factory, which
produces about 500,000 electric cars a year, consumed both natural resources
and labour and was neither ecological or sustainable.

There is a Soho House meme account on Instagram with 128,000 followers. Among
its recent posts are ones lampooning the exclusive private members’ club for
supposed frat boy behaviour and a video with the caption: “Love it when £200
leaves my bank account then I’m told to wait four hours for a table at 3pm.”

It has hit a nerve with some members and investors worldwide. “It’s like this
every time, every time I come,” says Zach, an “every house” member, which
means he can access all of the 42 houses across the world for £2,920 a year.
“You can never get a table, it takes ages to get served, and you’re paying a
lot for the privilege of being a member. I don’t really know what the point is
any more. It doesn’t feel special, I don’t feel special.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

amid conservative attacks on inclusivity initiatives

A coalition of business leaders sent letters to the CEOs of the Fortune 500
companies on Wednesday urging them to maintain a commitment to diversity,
equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as they come under conservative attack.

“Business decisions intended to capture the value from diversity initiatives
have been politicized by a vocal minority of ideologically motivated voices
who ignore both facts and the law,” the letter from groups including US Black
Chambers and the Global Black Economic Forum read. “We believe it is
imperative that CEOs and other company leaders are able to make strategic
decisions for their companies without threats of frivolous lawsuits and
political pressure.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
