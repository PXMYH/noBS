            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Jeffrey L Bowman’s Reframe consultancy is using artificial intelligence to
help with engaging employees with diversity programming or making a budget for
DEI work

With its focus on remedying historical and economic inequities, DEI has become
an unassailable component of American life. The ideological framework – more
formally known as diversity, equity and inclusion – is now a standard element
of how businesses are run and students are taught. (It’s also become a
weaponized term, as was the case when a New York Post column said that Kamala
Harris would be a “DEI president”.)

Nearly $350bn flowed into DEI and racial justice initiatives during the two
years following the 2020 murder George Floyd, according to a report by
McKinsey. The DEI industry – mostly consultants whose work focuses on helping
organizations review and revise their spending, recruiting and hiring
practices – is worth close to $10bn. But over the past few years, DEI programs
have been dramatically downsized. Universities such as Harvard and MIT are now
scrapping mandatory DEI statements and companies ranging from Nordstrom to
Salesforce are slashing related budgets and staffing targets.

Amazon UK Services, which employs more than half of the group’s UK workers,

            <p>Ex-Alameda CEO and ex-girlfriend of fallen crypto mogul pleaded guilty, but
prosecutors requested lenient sentence

Caroline Ellison, the former crypto executive and romantic partner of the
disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to 24 months in prison
**** in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. Ellison was a central figure in
the FTX bankruptcy saga and key witness for the prosecution in the $8bn fraud
trial that ended with Bankman-Fried’s conviction.

Ellison served as the chief executive of Alameda Research, which was the
trading arm of the now defunct FTX crypto exchange. The collapse of FTX, once
valued at $32bn, was directly linked to revelations that it was attempting to
financially prop up Alameda with fraudulent accounting. Subsequent
investigations and criminal charges found that FTX and the hedge fund had used
billions in customer funds for risky trades and lavish personal spending.

Adopting a suite of measures to reduce borrowing costs, the People’s Bank of
China cut interest rates on existing mortgages by 0.5 percentage points and

Less than 30 miles south of the Fiserv Forum, the Wisconsin convention center
where Republicans confirmed Donald Trump as their nominee for president for
the third time, lies the site of a project Trump predicted would become “the

A 113-year-old courthouse with a towering copper dome near the banks of the

  * Federal Reserve cuts US interest rates for the first time in four years

The Federal Reserve announced a half-percentage point interest-rate cut on
Wednesday, the first decrease in four years. It’s a moment that many
economists see as the end of an era, and the beginning of the end of the
central bank’s fight against inflation.

The Fed’s prime rate – used to set the rates on everything from mortgages to
car loans – has sat at a 20-year high for the last year, making it more
expensive to borrow money.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
