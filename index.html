Donald Trump’s threatened 30% tariffs on European goods would eliminate
transatlantic trade, the EU’s chief negotiator with the US has said, while
voicing hope that a deal remained possible.

Maroš Šefčovič, the EU trade commissioner, said a tariff of 30% or more would
have a huge impact, making it “almost impossible to continue” current
transatlantic trade, which is worth €4.4bn (£3.8bn) a day.

town where the billionaire had built Tesla’s European production hub – wrote
to the state premier to complain.

“How can you do business with someone who supports rightwing extremism?” she
asked Dietmar Woidke, the Social Democrat leader of the eastern state of
Brandenburg, who had backed the setting up of the Tesla Giga factory in
Grünheide.

Undocumented farm workers feel they’re being “hunted like animals”, they told
the Guardian, as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up its crackdown on
immigration.

Raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have caused workers to lose
hours and income, and forced them into hiding at home, according to
interviews.

            <p>The expanding group of emerging powers is building new rules, new tools and a
shared industrial future – with or without Donald Trump

The Brics summit in Brazil last week revealed a loose alliance of emerging
powers becoming more complex – and perhaps more consequential. For Brics, heft
matters. It now counts 11 member states – including Indonesia, which joined
this year – representing half the world’s population and 40% of the global
economy, outpacing the G7 by $20tn.

Yet its size hides its contradictions. The grouping’s call for more inclusive
global institutions sounds welcome, but there is a preponderance of
autocracies within its own ranks. Brics is right that international law should
be upheld in Middle Eastern conflicts. But it climbs down from its moral
pedestal by condemning Ukraine’s strikes on Russian infrastructure – while
staying silent on Moscow’s relentless attacks on civilians.

            <p>Experts suspect ‘front loading’ of activity may mask deeper impact of tariffs
on the US economy

“There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change,” Donald
Trump said on his Truth Social platform this week. “All money will be due and
payable starting AUGUST 1, 2025 – no extensions will be granted.”

There had, in fact, been a change. The 90-day “pause” on the highest tariffs
threatened by Trump on his so-called “liberation day” in April elapsed on
Wednesday. But with just three trade agreements in place, instead of the 300
once promised, the White House had switched one deadline for another.

A Guardian analysis has raised fresh questions over the way regulators and

emitting dangerous levels of pollution.

Between 2014 and 2024, air pollution permit applications in Michigan –
designed to gauge if proposed industrial projects would cause regions to
violate federal pollution limits – did not meet data collection rules or best
practices over 90% of the time. Some measurements were taken more than a
hundred miles away from sites.

WK Kellogg on Thursday agreed to be bought by the owner of Ferrero Rocher in a
deal worth about $3.1bn, as the cereal maker has been struggling with
weakening consumer demand due to persistently high inflation.

Deal making in the snacking space has picked up pace as food brands battle
muted sales in the wake of price hikes owing to higher input costs and a shift
in consumer preference for healthier options.

            <p>Ex-NBC executive was tasked with building an ‘everything app’, but billionaire
owner was biggest obstacle in her path

In May 2023, when Linda Yaccarino, an NBC advertising executive, joined what
was then still known as Twitter, she was given a tall order: repair the
company’s relationship with advertisers after a chaotic year of being owned by
Elon Musk. But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted an antisemitic
tweet that drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal,
Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the
platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference –
which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to
advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger: “Go fuck yourselves.”
Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.

“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail
me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said.
“Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”

“T-shirts, basic t-shirts, underwear, the basic necessities – the prices are

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Social housing makes up almost half of the city’s 1m homes. The system isn’t
perfect, but it gets a lot of things right

When it comes to best-practice examples in the housing debate, Vienna is a
common reference. Indeed, the Austrian capital features prominently in
narratives about successful housing policies. An article in the Observer
concluded that Vienna shows “decent homes for all” is not an impossible dream.
And the New York Times even declared it “a renters’ utopia”.

A considerable part of the attraction of Vienna relates to its large social-
housing stock. It accounts for some 43% of the roughly 1m housing units in the
city. About half of it is municipally owned council housing. The other half is
provided and administered by limited-profit housing associations – an Austrian
version of social housing providers that are permitted to make a small profit
to finance their operations. Social housing is not just for those on low
incomes, but also caters to middle- and even some upper-middle-class
households.

            <p>The British Beer and Pub Association calls for help to cut pub costs with 378
pubs in England, Scotland and Wales likely to call time this year

British pubs will close down at the rate of one a day this year, the
industry’s trade body has warned, blaming high business taxes. At the same
time, the hospitality sector has called on ministers to tackle “eye-watering”
costs.

The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents more than 20,000
pubs in the UK, said it expects 378 to close this year in England, Scotland
and Wales, at a cost of 5,600 jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
