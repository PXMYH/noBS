            <p>New documentary looks for a woman who was synonymous with typing in the 80s
and 90s, with surprising results

Before bashing out emails and text messages by thumb became an accepted form
of communication, typing was a fully manual skill. In the 80s, “the office”
was an exclusive preserve for freaks who could type 40 words per minute _at
least_. Those too modest or miserly to sign up for brick-and-mortar classes
could pick up a software program called Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing for $50.
At my Catholic high school, the application _was_ **** the typing class. The
priests just switched on the computers.

Launched in late 1987, Mavis Beacon quickly assumed pride of place on home PC
desks amid floppy disks for SimCity and After Dark. Among other features,
Mavis gamified typing drills and tracked typing progress in explicit detail.
Its defining feature was the elegant Black woman with a cream suit and
slicked-back bob marching proudly off to her high-rise job on the cover of the
software package. But it would take a few more decades for the bigger lesson
in the pitfalls of relinquishing control over your image and likeness to
corporate interests.

            <p>Nvidia co-founder Curtis Priem has a vision for a quantum computing future and
believes the area along the Hudson valley is fertile for the next tech boom

The “quantum chandelier” that sits within a glass box in the chapel at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s campus in Troy, New York, is the symbolic
centerpiece of an ambitious effort to turn upstate New York into an advanced
technology center – what Silicon Valley is to social media or Cambridge,
Massachusetts, is to biotech.

The silver sci-fi object, named for interior gold lattices that suspend, cool
and isolate its processor, is the heart of a “quantum computing system” that
could herald a new age of computing. It’s the centerpiece of the dream Curtis
Priem, a co-founder of Nvidia, the $2.8tn artificial intelligence hardware and
software company, has of turning Rensselaer, or RPI, into an advanced
computing hub and refashioning this area of upstate New York into a new
Silicon Valley.

            <p>Kwadjo Owusu-Ansah hasn’t even promoted his latest line of brightly colored
helmets, but ‘the most amazing people are finding them’

It was a zipper that propelled Kwadjo Owusu-Ansah’s project into motion.
“There was a flannel shirt I made with bleach,” the self-taught fashion
designer recalls, “and I hand-sewed the zipper on to the back of the shirt. I
think I fell in love, because almost everything I make has a zipper now.” That
device, and Owusu-Ansah’s fixation on it, were the seeds of Animated People,
his brand of innovative streetwear.

Owusu-Ansah – who goes by the name DamnKojo professionally and works full time
in marketing at a wine and spirits company – sees his fashion line as less of
an up-and-coming label than an ongoing art project. “I want you to tell your
own story,” Owusu-Ansah, 31, says. “Make your own meaning with my art. Dissect
it. Think about it. Why is a dude wearing a miniskirt today? [I want people]
to question the pieces when they see them. That’s what starts a conversation.”

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
