industry says it would drive companies away

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, on Sunday vetoed a hotly contested
artificial intelligence safety bill after the tech industry raised objections.
Newsom said that requiring companies to stress-test large AI models before
releasing them could drive AI businesses from the state and hinder innovation.

“California is home to 32 of the world’s 50 leading AI companies,” the
governor said in a statement accompanying the veto. “The bill applies
stringent standards to even the most basic functions – so long as a large
system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting
the public from real threats posed by the technology.”

Mark Zuckerberg is revamping his public image with new threads. With a trio of
bold shirts worn in recent appearances, he’s communicating that he came, he
saw, he conquered and he will win again at any cost. The fits might be sick,
but we would do well to beware.

During a live, packed-auditorium podcast interview last week, the CEO of Meta
wore a drop-shouldered black shirt reading “pathei mathos”, Greek for
“learning through suffering”. At his 40th birthday party in May, he donned a
black tee with the motto “Carthago delenda est,” which translates from Latin
to “Carthage must be destroyed.” He wore a black shirt with black text that
read “Aut Zuck aut nihil” during Meta’s Connect product demonstration on
Wednesday.

            <p>The future of US Steel hangs in the balance amid a proposed sale to Japan’s
Nippon, which both candidates have vowed to block

The Monongahela River winds through the tight Mon Valley south of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, creating a main artery in the nation’s industrial heart, where
the steel and coal industries have driven the region’s economy and shaped
political landscapes since the late 19th century.

In the weeks preceding the election, the region is once again playing an
outsize role in determining the nation’s political future. A controversial
Biden-Harris administration plan to kill Pittsburgh-based US Steel’s proposed
sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel is viewed in part as an election-year strategy to
shore up critical union support in a must-win swing state.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Jeffrey L Bowman’s Reframe consultancy is using artificial intelligence to
help with engaging employees with diversity programming or making a budget for
DEI work

With its focus on remedying historical and economic inequities, DEI has become
an unassailable component of American life. The ideological framework – more
formally known as diversity, equity and inclusion – is now a standard element
of how businesses are run and students are taught. (It’s also become a
weaponized term, as was the case when a New York Post column said that Kamala
Harris would be a “DEI president”.)

Nearly $350bn flowed into DEI and racial justice initiatives during the two
years following the 2020 murder George Floyd, according to a report by
McKinsey. The DEI industry – mostly consultants whose work focuses on helping
organizations review and revise their spending, recruiting and hiring
practices – is worth close to $10bn. But over the past few years, DEI programs
have been dramatically downsized. Universities such as Harvard and MIT are now
scrapping mandatory DEI statements and companies ranging from Nordstrom to
Salesforce are slashing related budgets and staffing targets.

Ten of the busiest ports in North America are at risk of shutdown next week,

if industry operators fail to make key concessions.

The International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) has accused the United

terminal operators, of making “insulting offers” to staff demanding higher pay
and commitments on automation.

In a nondescript building in an industrial park in central Mexico, cavernous

computations and cooled by thousands of little fans and large vents blasting
great columns of air across the room.

Workers have manned a picket line outside Boeing’s airplane factory in Renton,
Washington, around the clock since tens of thousands walked off the job
earlier this month. Almost two weeks into the strike, the largest now under
way in the US, nobody knows when it will end.

Orlando, a quality inspector at the aerospace giant, arrived at 3.45am on
Saturday, long before dawn. On the outskirts of a city as expensive as
Seattle, the cost of living is “always going up”, he said. “And I guess the
biggest part is making sure our wages reflect that.”

The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has said he expects
interest rates to fall gradually but warned consumers not to expect a return
to near-zero levels.

Bailey said he was “very encouraged” by the downwards path of inflation and
“therefore I do think the path for interest rates will be downwards,
gradually”. Last week, the Bank kept borrowing costs on hold at 5%.

before making loans.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
