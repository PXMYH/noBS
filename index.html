The number of jobs added surpassed expectations, as economists largely
anticipated a drop in openings. Instead, **3** ,000 more jobs were added in

Statistics (BLS). The unemployment rate actually decreased to 4.1%, down from
4.2% in May.

Last November, Donald Trump made a solemn vow to all Americans: “Every
citizen, I will fight for you, your family and your future every single day.”
Eight months later, Trump is vigorously backing many policies that will mean
pain for millions.

Trump has pushed to enact the Republican budget bill, which would make
significant cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance, and would do the
greatest damage to those Americans struggling hardest to make ends meet – the
30% of the US population that lives in households earning under $50,000 a
year.

The UK competition watchdog has written to Ticketmaster threatening legal
action over the way it sold more than 900,000 tickets for Oasis’s reunion
tour, days before the start of what is expected to be the most popular, and
profitable, run of gigs in British history.

In March, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) published concerns that
Ticketmaster may have misled fans, some of whom paid more than £350 for
tickets with a face value of £150, in the way it priced tickets for the band’s
comeback gigs when they went on sale last August.

Tesla posted another big drop in quarterly deliveries on Wednesday, putting it
on course for its second straight annual sales decline as demand falters due
to backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s political stance and an ageing vehicle
lineup.

Tesla said it delivered 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter, down 13.5%
from 443,956 units a year ago. Analysts had expected it to report deliveries
of about 394,378 vehicles, according to an average of 23 estimates from the
financial research firm Visible Alpha, though projections went to as low as
360,080 units based on estimates from 10 analysts over the past month.
Analysts use the number of vehicles delivered to customers as a metric of
success to evaluate both automotive sales and production.

            <p>Paramount agreed to pay $16m to Trump’s future library or other cause, but not
to him, but made no apology

Donald Trump has reached a $16m settlement with Paramount, the parent of CBS
News, over what he claimed was false editing of a pre-election interview with
the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, in what is likely to be
seen as a further example of capitulation by media companies hoping to smooth
the waters with Trump.

Trump had filed a $10bn lawsuit against the company in October, one of a
string of legal actions against US media conglomerates over what the US
president maintains was biased, incorrect or “fake” news reporting.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Research says Google’s carbon emissions went up by 65% between 2019-2024, not
51% as the tech giant had claimed

In 2021, Google set a lofty goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by
2030. Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite
direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its
latest sustainability report, Google said its carbon emissions had increased
51% between 2019 and 2024.

New research aims to debunk even that enormous figure and provide context to
Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored
by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and
2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between
2010, the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions,
and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos
found. The largest year-over-year jump in that window was also the most
recent, 2023 to 2024, when Google saw a 26% increase in emissions just between
2023 and 2024, according to the report.

As chief executive of AMG Lithium, the EU’s first factory to make the lithium

Trump has repeatedly urged Powell to reduce borrowing costs in the US economy.

four rare earths on a commercial scale – a group of minerals key to the energy
transition at the centre of the trade dispute between China and the US.

Until now, China has dominated the separation of rare earths, and accounts for
90% of the manufacture of rare-earth magnets, or super magnets, which are made
with these elements and used in electric cars, wind turbines and military
equipment such as jets.

            <p>From vintage finds to Spotify and savings goals, four gen Zers share what
budgeting looks like in their real lives

From no-buy-years to second-hand shopping, gen Z seems to have its own unique
spending habits. A global rise in the cost of living combined with a highly
competitive job market means that 69% of gen Z use some sort of budget to
manage their finances.

Their priorities, and what they choose to save for, are different from their
boomer counterparts. Gen Z is more likely to spend money on subscriptions,
from meal kits to Spotify. There’s also the trend of “doom spending”, which is
purchasing non-essential items to cope with either personal or wider political
issues.

When Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old self-described socialist, won New York’s
mayoral Democratic nomination last week over a seasoned but scandal-scarred
veteran, the city’s financial elite had a meltdown.

This was the start of “hot commie summer” in the city, New York hedgevfund

grocery chain Gristedes and friend of Donald Trump, warned on Fox Business:

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
