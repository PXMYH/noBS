decade.

            <p>Shares in French manufacturer tumble as second problem comes to light after
weekend of flight disruption

Airbus has fixed most of its jets affected by a software glitch after a
technical problem grounded thousands of its planes, but its shares tumbled on
Monday after it discovered a separate issue with its fuselage panels.

Airlines around the world cancelled and delayed flights over the weekend after
the French plane manufacturer ordered immediate repairs to 6,000 of its A320
family of jets, more than half of its global fleet.

to settle for ‘dupes’ over the real thing

TikTok finds and homemade gifts, trips to the mall and the endless search for
“dupes” – gen Z’s shopping habits are shaking up retail in the run-up to
Christmas. And with price tags climbing and brand loyalty slipping, retailers
this season must work harder to earn this generation’s dollar.

Gen Z’s spending power is expected to near $12tn by 2030. But this year those
aged 13 to 28 are expected to cut their holiday spending by a whopping 23% – a
sharper decline compared to other generations – according to a recent PwC
report.

            <p>Will the bubble ravage the economy when it bursts? What will it leave of value
once it pops?

The California Gold Rush left an outsized imprint on America. Some 300,000
people flocked there from 1848 to 1855, from as far away as the Ottoman
Empire. Prospectors massacred Indigenous people to take the gold from their
lands in the Sierra Nevada mountains. And they boosted the economies of nearby
states and faraway countries from whence they bought their supplies.

Gold provided the motivation for California – a former Mexican territory then
controlled by the US military – to become a state with laws of its own. And
yet, few “49ers” as prospectors were known, struck it rich. It was the
merchants selling prospectors food and shovels who made the money. One, a
Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss who sold denim overalls to the gold bugs
passing through San Francisco, may be the most remembered figure of his day.

“reinventors”, as the consultancy tries to position itself as a leader in
artificial intelligence.

The consultancy’s chief executive, Julie Sweet, has already started referring

used more widely.

Will retailers and merchants have a strong holiday season? That depends. This
year, more than most, the 2025 holiday season will actually be two holiday
seasons.

If your business caters to higher-income individuals or if you’re located in a
wealthier part of the country, you’ll probably have a decent holiday season.
True, even the wealthy are cutting back. But according to the HR firm ADP
average salaries have risen between 4.5% and 6.7% depending on whether workers
stayed or switched jobs. The stock markets, though increasingly volatile, are
up over 13% since the beginning of the year. And in some parts of the country,
notably New York, Boston, DC and San Francisco, the average household income
is over $125,000 - almost $41,000 higher than the national average. People in
this demographic may be a little more cautious but they’ll spend.

            <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say
they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their
contacts

Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution
offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant,
ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most
Admired Companies by the magazine, describes its financial advisers as “expert
listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after
goal”.

It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes
it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that
could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file
into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month
internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in
beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent
graduates themselves.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But
this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million
people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the
population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down
to zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4
million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less
than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable
success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European
peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of
work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that
much further ahead.

Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
