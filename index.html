            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>There is both hope and hype for what artificial intelligence can do for growth
– if politicians can tame its destructive potential

Since returning from this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos,
I have been asked repeatedly for my biggest takeaways. Among the most widely
discussed issues this year was artificial intelligence – especially generative
AI (“GenAI”). With the recent adoption of large language models (like the one
powering ChatGPT), there is much hope – and hype – about what AI could do for
productivity and economic growth in the future.

To address this question, we must bear in mind that our world is dominated far
more by human stupidity than by AI. The proliferation of megathreats – each an
element in the broader “polycrisis” – confirms that our politics are too
dysfunctional, and our policies too misguided, to address even the most
serious and obvious risks to our future. These include climate change, which
will have huge economic costs; failed states, which will make waves of climate
refugees even larger; and recurrent, virulent pandemics that could be even
more economically damaging than Covid-19.

The WEF zeitgeist is, in my experience, a counter-indicator of where the world
is really heading. Policymakers and business leaders are there to flog their
books and spew platitudes. They represent the conventional wisdom, which is
often based on a rear-window view of global and macroeconomic developments.

Central banks should be certain they have beaten inflation before cutting

Development (OECD) said despite revisions to its outlook that showed inflation
was falling at a faster rate than previously expected.

            <p>The hacker whose involvement with anti-piracy software ended in a jail
sentence has emerged from prison struggling to make rent as he starts paying
his fine. ‘It could be worse,’ he says

In April 2023, a 54-year-old programmer named Gary Bowser was released from
prison having served 14 months of a 40-month sentence. Good behaviour reduced
his time behind bars, but now his options are limited. For a while he was
crashing on a friend’s couch in Toronto. The weekly physical therapy sessions,
which he needs to ease chronic pain, were costing hundreds of dollars every
week, and he didn’t have a job. And soon, he would need to start sending
cheques to Nintendo. Bowser owes the makers of Super Mario $14.5m (£11.5m),
and he’s probably going to spend the rest of his life paying it back.

Since he was a child, Bowser’s life has revolved around tinkering with
electronics. His dad was a mechanical engineer, and he learned from him how to
wire up model trains and mod calculators. As a teenager he already had a
computer business: his mother died when he was 15, his father had retired and
Bowser supported him.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
