51% as the tech giant had claimed

In 2021, Google set a lofty goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by
2030. Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite
direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its
latest sustainability report, Google said its carbon emissions had increased
51% between 2019 and 2024.

New research aims to debunk even that enormous figure and provide context to
Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored
by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and
2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between
2010, the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions,
and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos
found. The largest year-over-year jump in that window was also the most
recent, 2023 to 2024, when Google saw a 26% increase in emissions just between
2023 and 2024, according to the report.

everything from electric vehicles to smartphones and wind turbines, a leading
German industrialist has said.

As chief executive of AMG Lithium, the EU’s first factory to make the lithium

            <p>Trump officials hail U-turn as Mark Carney says decision to rescind digital
services tax means revival of trade talks

The United States has said that Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, “caved”
to demands from the White House after his government abruptly scrapped their
digital services tax on US technology companies, which was set to go into
effect on Monday.

“It’s very simple. Prime Minister Carney and Canada caved to President

The US dollar has had its worst first half-year in more than 50 years, as the
financial markets over the last six months were dominated by geopolitical
crises and Donald Trump’s trade war.

The dollar has fallen by 10.8% against a basket of currencies since the start
of 2025. That is its worst performance over the first six months of any year
since 1973, and the worst half-year since the second half of 1991.

budgeting looks like in their real lives

From no-buy-years to second-hand shopping, gen Z seems to have its own unique
spending habits. A global rise in the cost of living combined with a highly
competitive job market means that 69% of gen Z use some sort of budget to
manage their finances.

Their priorities, and what they choose to save for, are different from their
boomer counterparts. Gen Z is more likely to spend money on subscriptions,
from meal kits to Spotify. There’s also the trend of “doom spending”, which is
purchasing non-essential items to cope with either personal or wider political
issues.

Disabled corporate workers at Amazon have accused the company of engaging in
“systemic discrimination”, aggressively quashing their attempts to organize,
and using artificial intelligence systems that they allege do not comply with
US disability laws.

At the center of the Amazon workers’ complaints are allegations that the
company has denied requests for accommodations for disabled staff in an
“automated” or “semi-automated” way and have allegedly repeatedly removed
messages and a petition from an employee Slack channel.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
