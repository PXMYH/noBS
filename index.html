As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, McKinsey accepted
responsibility for its role in the crisis and accepted wrongdoing outlined in

around the US, will begin an unfair labor practice strike.

Amazon workers at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, made history

            <p>As co-chair of Trump’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’, the world’s
richest man is likely to get richer

The Federal Advisory Committee Act says in plain language that an advisory
committee – as Elon Musk proposes the “Department of Government Efficiency” to
be – must ensure that its recommendations are not biased by any special
interest.

Yet, Musk, the richest man on Earth, has a wider and deeper range of potential
conflicts of interest with the federal government than perhaps any person has

            <p>Chevron spent billions trying to destroy him after he won the largest
pollution case in history. It’s time for Biden to end this nightmare

It’s a tale as old as time: an underdog fighting for what’s right, and a
powerful giant doing everything it can to stop him. Yet in today’s America,
the giants don’t lose – they rig the system to crush anyone who dares to
challenge them.

That’s exactly what happened to Steven Donziger, a well-known human rights
lawyer who stood up to oil giant Chevron. After helping Indigenous and farming
communities in Ecuador secure a historic $9.5bn judgment against the company
for decades of environmental destruction, Chevron retaliated with a vicious
legal campaign designed not just to discredit him, but to ruin his life.

Estimates from Greenly, a carbon accounting consultancy based in Paris, place
TikTok’s 2023 emissions in the US, UK and France at about 7.6m metric tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) – higher than those associated with
Twitter/X and Snapchat in the same region.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

            <p>CEOs spending more on stock buybacks than capital investments and employee
retirement plan contributions

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
