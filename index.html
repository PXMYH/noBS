                <p><strong>Published on:</strong> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 04:00:32 CDT</p>
                <p>&lt;p&gt;As author of The Big Short and Moneyball, Michael Lewis is perhaps the most celebrated journalist of his generation. Now he delivers an astonishing portrait of the fallen crypto billionaire. But did he get too close?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right around the time the gales of the financial crisis were tearing up Wall Street in 2009, Meredith Whitney started her own financial research firm. Whitney, a stock market analyst, had predicted the crash of the previous year, and among the journalists who had sought her out had been Michael Lewis. When her new Manhattan office opened and she threw “a party for all the muckety-mucks”, she invited Lewis. He had just published a magazine article calling &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2015/12/11/michael-lewis-big-short-conde-nast-portfolio.html&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;Wall Street’s titans greedy and stupid&lt;/a&gt;, so thrusting him into a gathering of those selfsame titans was like taking a Broadway heckler into the play’s dressing rooms. “But all these former heads of investment banks, all these current bankers – they ran, not walked, to the office, just to meet him,” Whitney said. “One hedge fund manager walked in with 15 copies of Lewis’s books. Michael signed them all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis enjoys a rare kind of celebrity among the moneyed men and women of the US. They believe he &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;them, that he is the Hemingway of their bullring. He used to be one of them, after all: a Salomon Brothers bond salesman in the late 1980s, and therefore part of the extravagant avarice that defined Wall Street in that decade. Then he quit to write a memoir about it, Liar’s Poker. It was the first in a series of blockbusters about the thin top slice of American society: the one in which Whitney and her muckety-mucks reside, alongside other mavens, savants and powerbrokers. They drive its commerce and politics, its sports and culture – and Lewis is their bard. He’s the kind of writer Vanity Fair will call upon to interview Barack Obama one day, Arnold Schwarzenegger the next. When a rumour surfaced that Vanity Fair used to pay Lewis $10 a word – while most journalists otherwise languish in the 50-cent range – it almost didn’t matter if it was true. (It was, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nymag.com/news/features/michael-lewis-2011-10/index3.html&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;it turned out&lt;/a&gt;.) The rumour merely confirmed what everyone knew: Lewis is the most prestigious narrator of American life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/03/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-crypto-going-infinite&#34;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>

                <p>&lt;p&gt;Wayne Borromeo’s Wondery outdoor apparel brand is dedicated exclusively to women, especially women of color&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Wayne Borromeo, an avid climber and adventure guide, noticed a problem in the outdoor sportswear market: nearly all of the major clothing retailers targeted male consumers. Borromeo, then 25, saw that the trend contributed to the country’s yawning “nature gap”, which he understood well through leading hiking, backpacking and rock climbing expeditions to outdoor meccas like the Yosemite and Zion national parks. So in a broom closet in his San Fernando valley home, along with his friend Kimberley Esliza, Borromeo created Wondery, one of the only outdoor apparel brands dedicated exclusively to women, particularly women of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of my core memories and emotions stem from the outdoors,” Borromeo said, noting that one of his fondest experiences was taking his dog, Luca, for a swim in the Kern River. He recalled the vast, serene mountainscapes that surrounded them and rendered him motionless. “I want other people to experience that too.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/11/wondery-women-bipoc-outdoor-apparel&#34;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</p>
