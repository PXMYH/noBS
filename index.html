serve as the central bank’s chair among President Donald Trump’s advisers as
they look for a replacement for Jerome Powell, according to people familiar
with the matter. Trump advisers are impressed with Waller’s willingness to
move on policy based on forecasting, rather than current data, and his deep
knowledge of the Fed system as a whole, the people said. Waller has met with
the president’s team about the role, but has yet to meet with Trump himself,
the people said on the condition of anonymity to discuss private
deliberations. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official, and Kevin Hassett,
currently Trump’s National Economic Council director, also remain in
contention for the job, the people said, which will open up when Powell’s
tenure as chair expires in May 2026. A representative for the Fed declined to
comment. Bloomberg&#39;s Mike McKee reports. (Source: Bloomberg)

            <p>Trump may soon name pick for open Fed board seat and Fed chair nominee, but
Bessent wants to stay in current role

Donald Trump said he would “shortly” announce his pick for an open seat on the
Federal Reserve’s board of governors and possibly his nominee for Fed chair as
well, but that he had removed the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, from
consideration since Bessent wants to remain in his current job.

In a CNBC interview, Trump called it a “pleasant surprise” that the Fed
governor Adriana Kugler had decided to leave her seat now instead of when her
term ends in January, a move that appears to have accelerated Trump’s decision
on who to appoint to an open seat on the Fed board with possible plans to
promote that person to the top policymaking role when the term of the Fed
chair, Jerome Powell, ends in May.

            <p>The president has an awful lot to say about tariffs – but what about what he
_doesn’t_ say?

Donald Trump’s words and actions rarely align perfectly. If you watch
carefully, what he doesn’t say can be just as telling as what he does.

“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,
to bring down the prices of all goods,” he told the nation ahead of his re-
election. The US president declared that 2 April would “forever be remembered
as the day American industry was reborn”, only to pause tariffs a week later.

The world’s biggest spirits company, Diageo, has revealed a slump in annual

the resignation of the chief executive, Debra Crew.

The FTSE 100 company, which owns brands including Guinness, Johnnie Walker
whisky, Gordon’s gin and Smirnoff vodka, reported a nearly 28% fall in
operating profit in the 12 months to the end of June compared with a year
earlier.

growth.

In recent months Chinese officials have talked repeatedly of the need to
combat “involution” in sectors suffering from overcapacity, such as EVs,
referring to the phenomenon of investing more effort and money for diminishing
returns.

The former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioners and non-partisan

commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report data revealed jobs
growth stalled this summer.

Trump, without any evidence to back his claims, alleged McEntarfer “faked”
employment numbers in the run-up to the 2024 election to boost Kamala Harris’s
chances and said that the recent data was “rigged” to make Trump and
Republicans look bad.

In March 2020, about the time the Covid pandemic started, Christina Chapman, a
woman who lived in Arizona and Minnesota, received a message on LinkedIn
asking her to “be the US face” of a company and help overseas IT workers gain
remote employment.

As working from home became the norm for many people, Chapman was able to find
jobs for the foreign workers at hundreds of US companies, including some in
the Fortune 500, such as Nike; “a premier Silicon Valley technology company”;

The US’s largest companies have spent 2025 locked in a competition to spend
more money than one another, lavishing $155bn on the development of artificial
intelligence, more than the US government has spent on education, training,
employment and social services in the 2025 fiscal year so far.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
