            <p>Andrew Ross Sorkin’s new book 1929 takes readers back to the crash that
changed the US and looks at what we can learn from it today

Andrew Ross Sorkin’s first book, Too Big to Fail, was a bestseller about the
financial crisis of 2008, published the following year. His second, 1929, out
this week, takes readers “Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History –
and How it Shattered a Nation”.

It’s been 16 years between books, but Sorkin hasn’t been idle. A columnist for
the New York Times, he founded its DealBook newsletter and summit; he’s a
Squawk Box co-anchor for CNBC; and after Too Big to Fail was filmed by HBO, he

among the president’s Maga base

Donald Trump is not making America feel great again.

Nine months into the second Trump administration, Americans are feeling pretty
crummy. More than half – 53% – believe the economy is worsening, according to
the latest survey conducted by Harris for the Guardian. That’s just slightly
better than the 58% who thought it was going downhill in late April, when
financial markets were still reeling from the president’s “liberation day”
tariffs. About 60% think the cost of living has gotten worse since the start
of the year; 47% say the job market is worse.

Shein has reported a 20% rise in global revenues to $37bn (£27.7bn) but
profits have fallen as the fast-fashion retailer faced increased costs, even
before it felt the impact of recent changes to US tax laws.

The Singaporean parent company of the rapidly growing retailer said pre-tax
profits had fallen by 13% to $1.3bn last year from $1.5bn in 2023 after an
increase in selling and marketing costs, according to new accounts.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker
last year, according to a report on the growing gap between top executives and
their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
