            <p>In a 2-1 ruling, judges found grant program run by Black-woman owned venture
capitalist firm ‘likely to violate’ Civil Rights Act

A US federal court of appeals panel has suspended Fearless Fund, an Atlanta-
based, Black woman-owned venture capitalist firm, from continuing the firm’s
Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, a grant program for Black female business
owners.

In the 2-1 ruling, the panel of three judges, two appointed by Donald Trump
and one appointed by Barack Obama, ruled that the grant program “is
substantially likely to violate” section 1981 of the federal Civil Rights Act
of 1866, which prohibits the use of race in making contracts. The act aimed to
fully integrate formerly enslaved Black Americans as citizens, give them the
full rights of American citizenship and to make it illegal to deprive any
Americans of rights “on the basis of race, color, or prior condition of
slavery or involuntary servitude”.

            <p>Democrats try to connect the dots as some in Saginaw wonder if Trump is ‘just
a better fit with the economy’

 _Less than six months before the US presidential election on 5 November,
anxiety over the economy looms large. While official figures show a
significant recovery since the pandemic, many Americans aren’t buying it. As
election day approaches, the Guardian is dispatching reporters to key swing
counties to gauge how they are feeling – and how they might vote._

Joe Biden should be worried about Janel Turner, owner of Kreole Qweenz, a
gumbo shop in downtown Saginaw, Michigan.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
