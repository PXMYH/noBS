  *  **Business live – latest updates**

The company behind Tokyo’s renowned metro system has won a deal to take over

owned operator MTR.

Tokyo Metro Company (TMC) has promised to bring Japanese reliability and

            <p>Amid the normalization of gambling, betting companies are resembling
broadcasters and vice versa – and coverage is rapidly becoming a tangled web
of vested interests

In sports broadcasting’s equivalent of a team changing its colors from red to
blue in mid-season, the Diamond Sports Group, a bankrupt operator of 16
regional sports networks, last month rebranded its channels as the FanDuel
Sports Network.

The prior name was already linked to gambling – Bally’s held the branding
rights for three years. But FanDuel is a higher-profile new partner with a
much larger parent company. Flutter, headquartered in New York and originating
from the Irish-British merger of Paddy Power and Betfair, is the world’s
largest online betting business.

  * Bali recycling scheme swamped with garbage

Oil and chemical companies who created a high-profile alliance to end plastic
pollution have produced 1,000 times more new plastic in five years than the
waste they diverted from the environment, according to new data obtained by
Greenpeace.

The Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW) was set up in 2019 by a group of
companies which include ExxonMobil, Dow, Shell, TotalEnergies and
ChevronPhillips, some of the world’s biggest producers of plastic. They
promised to divert 15m tonnes of plastic waste from the environment in five
years to the end of 2023, by improving collection and recycling, and creating
a circular economy.

The pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai has said he never tried to influence
foreign policy or ask foreign officials to take concrete action on Hong Kong,
on his first day giving evidence at his national security trial.

However, he “hoped against hope” that Donald Trump would stop Beijing imposing
its national security law on the city, and so sought to have Apple Daily’s
coverage of the then president be less critical.

            <p>The Rue Dix marketplace and restaurant in Crown Heights offers Senegalese
fashion and flavor

Nilea Alexander and her husband, Lamine Diagne, started out with a
neighborhood coffee shop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Over the past decade,
though, their modest enterprise has evolved into what they call “an
experience”. Next door to Café Rue Dix, which serves Senegalese cuisine,
pastries and lattes, is Marché Rue Dix, their marketplace-boutique stocked
with goods sourced directly from Senegal, Diagne’s birthplace. The couple’s
goal is to create a one-stop destination where customers leave with both a
story and a piece of Senegal.

Rue Dix, or “10th Street” in French, is a nod to Diagne’s roots in Pikine, a
city to the east of the Senegalese capital of Dakar. “Markets are very big in
Senegal,” he said. Visitors to the cafe can order its signature dish, thiebou
jen – a savory blend of jollof rice, vegetables and red snapper stew. And then
they can head to the boutique, which offers everything from traditional Ataya
tea and an asymmetric crochet skirt to a gilded brass arm cuff and a bucket
bag made from rope and plastic.

The CEOs of some of the largest employers with the lowest-paid workers in the
US are more “focused on their own personal short-term windfall” – spending
significantly more money on stock buybacks than capital investments and
contributions to employee retirement plans, according to a new report released
by the Institute for Policy Studies.

Between 2019 to 2023, the 100 largest low-wage employers in the US, the 100
corporations in the S&amp;P 500 with the lowest median worker pay, spent $522bn on
stock buybacks. Lowe’s and Home Depot spent the most on stock buybacks, with
Lowe’s spending $42.6bn during this period and Home Depot spending $37.2bn.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.
