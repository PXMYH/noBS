            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>For years, the company has focused on costs at the expense of its engineering
heritage. Now the numbers look bad too

Aviation jargon can hide all kinds of horrors. This month Boeing introduced a
new phrase to a wider audience – _Quality escape_ _(n.)_ : part of a 737 Max
plane falling off at 14,000ft, producing a deafening roar as the air rushes
past passengers fast enough to rip phones from hands and clothing from bodies.

It appears that someone in the factory failed to properly fit bolts securing

            <p>Thousands of hotel workers in southern California have gone on strike over 100
times since last July, with some still fighting for new union contracts

Last year was a big year for the US labor movement with historic wins and
gains for workers at UPS, automakers, and for writers and actors in Hollywood.
But for thousands of hotel workers, the majority of whom are Latina women from
immigrant communities, their fight has continued into 2024 without garnering
the same amount of public attention.

California’s hotel workers have led one of the biggest strike waves to ever
hit the US hotel industry to secure wage increases they say they need to
afford to live in the areas where they work. Their actions coincided with the
“hot labor summer” that saw ultimately successful union campaigns from
Hollywood writers, actors and others.

expected.

            <p>Biggest reduction since December 2021 will allow 1tn more yuan to be released
in form of new loans

China’s central bank has announced a surprise cut to the amount of cash that
banks must hold in reserve, hoping to boost the lending available to
households and businesses as policymakers try to steer the economy through a
fragile recovery.

Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), said on
Wednesday that the reserve requirement ratio would be cut by 0.5% from 5
February, the deepest cut to the rate since December 2021. The move will allow
about 1tn yuan (£110.8bn) to be released in the form of new loans.

Chinese markets have lifted following a report suggesting that Beijing

enterprises to reverse a recent share rout.

The benchmark CSI 300 index, which replicates the top 300 stocks traded on the
Shanghai and the Shenzhen bourses, had fallen to a five-year low, while the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks traded in Hong
Kong, had dropped to its lowest in nearly two decades.

            <p>Following her bestselling debut Such a Fun Age, Reid has turned to campus life
for her new book Come and Get It. She talks class, money and why becoming a
mother has made her a better writer

‘I knew I wanted to write about young people and money,” says Kiley Reid,
recalling the moment in spring 2019 when the idea for her next book came into
view. She had finished editing her debut, the much-loved Such a Fun Age, __
and was completing her masters degree in fiction at the University of Iowa.
She began interviewing undergraduates about their relationship to money,
paying them $15 for 40 minutes of their time. She asked them about their
interpretation of “load-bearing” words, like “classy”, and “trashy”. One
student mentioned her dad’s habit of paying her “practice paychecks” from his
office’s payroll, though she did not work for him. It seemed Reid had stumbled
upon a creative way to practise corporate fraud; she also had the beginnings
of a new novel.

We are speaking over tea in a central London hotel, at a bar with deep red
walls, gilded furnishings and a tea menu that is several pages long. It seems
particularly appropriate for a conversation about money, class and cultural
capital. Reid, 36, has just flown over from Michigan, where she lives and
works as a writing professor. Wearing a summery dress that appears optimistic
against today’s stormy sky, she is warm and relaxed, unfazed by both the
travel and the weather.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>New research found that poorest fifth pay a tax rate 60% higher, on average,
than the top 1% of households

A total of 44 of the 50 US states worsen inequality by making the wealthy pay
a lesser share of their income in taxes than lower income people, a new
analysis has found.

State and local tax regimes are “upside-down”, the new research finds, with
weak or non-existent personal income taxes in many states allowing richer
Americans to avoid tax. A reliance on sales and excise taxes, considered
regressive because they disproportionately impact the poor, has helped fuel
this inequality, according to the report.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
