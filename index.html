  * Business live – latest updates

Oil prices have risen sharply after Iran rejected calls to end support for
attacks by Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea and sent a warship to the
key trading route.

In the first trading session of the new year, Brent crude rose $1.73, or more
than 2%, to $78.77 a barrel on Tuesday, while US West Texas Intermediate crude
was at $73.36 a barrel, up $1.71, or 2.4%.

            <p>The index grabbed attention from the start, but shows its age as 21st-century
tech stocks go elsewhere

Here is a poor prediction from 40 years ago, 1984, when the FTSE 100 index was
born. There is “no question of the FT 30 index disappearing,” opined the
deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, arguing that the new-fangled
creation would sit happily alongside the paper’s own FT 30, the pre-eminent
barometer of the UK stock market since 1935.

It did not work out that way. The FTSE 100 grabbed attention from the off,
just as its designers intended. It was created by the London Stock Exchange
and the early players in the futures and options market for the then emerging
era of electronic trading and derivative products. A catchy shorthand – the
Footsie – helped.

            <p>Brazilian-born Nemuel DePaula wants his Lenita flower truck business to
blossom in its brick-and-mortar location

Nemuel DePaula has never been afraid of big pivots. The Brazil native
immigrated to Boston at age 10, started his own graphic design business,
Grita, while still in high school, and moved himself and the business across
the country to Los Angeles in 2013. Four years later, DePaula took a gamble
again with Lenita, the part-time mobile flower shop he launched and named
after his mother.

DePaula, 35, has been captivated by flowers since childhood. “The first thing
I ever stole was a rose,” he said with a laugh as he recalled the perfect
bloom he snipped from his neighbor’s garden and slipped to his mom as a small
child. Over the years, his aesthetic sensibilities evolved from purloined
roses to less conventional species. His latest love is the “graffiti
anthurium”, a tropical flower with a natural paint-splattered effect that
resembles a bloodied orchid – but in a cool way.

habits. This can include where they shop, how long they stay on websites and
personal information, such as email addresses and mobile phone numbers.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Strikes by autoworkers, actors and writers brought wins in 2023, but analysts
worry labor laws could undo progress

Labor experts see more wins ahead in 2024 for US unions after a year of
attention-grabbing strikes and surging public support but worry gains may be
stymied by the US’s “broken” labor laws.

Strikes by autoworkers, writers, actors and nurses and a threatened strike by
UPS workers all led to significant wins in 2023. “The big challenge for labor
in 2024 will be to take that momentum and turn it into new organizing and
getting first contracts where workers have organized,” said Ken Jacobs, the
co-director of the UC Berkeley Labor Center. “That’s going to be a real
challenge because labor law in the US is broken.”

The gifting is done. Some were successful, others less so – the wrong color,
size, redundant, too impulsive, not suitable for re-gifting. US consumers
return about 20% of all online purchases and the post-holiday period is when
the massive, but often unseen, returns logistics industry _–_ the reverse
supply chain _–_ goes into overdrive.

According to the National Retail Federation, US consumers returned more than
$816bn worth of retail merchandise in 2022, up 7% from a record $761bn a year
earlier, and more than the US defense budget.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Stung by 2008’s oil price spike, Uruguay now produces up to 98% of its
electricity from renewables. Can other countries follow suit?

It was the 2000s, and fossil fuel prices were rising worldwide. After a period
of volatility in the 1980s, the crude oil price per barrel had reached one of
its lowest points – $20 – at the end of 2001 but then, over the course of six
years, it tripled before a new oil shock saw prices surpass those of the
1970s, reaching a record $145 a barrel on 3 July 2008.

Uruguay imports its oil, so it had a problem. Demand for energy in the country
had grown by 8.4% the previous year and household energy bills were increasing
at a similar rate. The 3.4 million-strong population was becoming restless.
Lacking alternatives, President Tabaré Vázquez was forced to buy energy from
neighbouring states at higher prices, even though Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay had a mutual aid agreement in case of emergency conditions.

            <p>High-income Americans also almost as likely to defer healthcare over cost as
people with low or average incomes in other countries

High-income Americans are almost as likely to defer healthcare because of cost
as people with low or average incomes in eight other developed countries, a
new survey brief by the Commonwealth Fund finds.

The survey findings also show that nearly half of American adults (46%) faced
a problem with a medical bill in the last year, and almost half with low or
average incomes (46%) skipped or delayed needed care because of price – the
highest rate in any of nine countries analyzed.

            <p>The supreme court’s decision to strike down diversity policies in higher
education raises concerns over future of DEI in employment

Now that the supreme court has declared affirmative action policies in college
and university admissions unconstitutional, questions are arising over whether
the court’s decision will affect diversity efforts in the workplace.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have long been taken on by
companies trying to diversify their employees and leaders, and after the
racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, many
more businesses promised to prioritize diversity initiatives in hiring and
retention. Even Chick-fil-A, a company long thought of as conservative for its
stance on LGBTQ issues, voiced a commitment to diversity and created a new
vice-president role for DEI.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
