            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Employees express growing anxiety over their pay – and the future of their
jobs – amid the US government shutdown

With no end of the federal government shutdown in sight, an estimated 750,000
workers remain furloughed. Hundreds of thousands more are working without pay.
They are being “held hostage by a political dispute”, according to union
leaders, as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked.

In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested that furloughed
employees would not necessarily receive back pay – despite a legal guarantee –
prompting further unease throughout the federal workforce. “There are some
people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in
a different way,” the US president said.

  * Britons travelling to EU to undergo new biometric checks at border from Sunday

Many travellers to Europe will see changes in border security from Sunday with
the launch of the EU’s new digital entry and exit system (EES) after many
delays.

The system means most non-EU citizens will have to register their biometric
information at the border. Travellers’ faces will have to be photographed and
fingerprints scanned before they are allowed into Europe’s Schengen area. The
system will eventually replace passports being stamped by border officials.

The White House announced layoffs of federal workers on Friday, making good on

appears set to stretch into a third week.

Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and

government’s reduction-in-force procedure to let employees go.

But step out the back door and the resort is still firmly, as it is better
known, Magaluf: boozed-up Britain in Spain, with cocktails by the pint.

Mallorca got most of the Balearics’ 3.5 million UK visitors last year: for
some residents, far too many. The island has become emblematic of the most
heated debate in travel: overtourism – and how to tackle it.

            <p>Deportations are likely to cause employers to let go of US workers, and reduce
the labor force

The government shutdown may have prevented the publication of September’s job
report, but we can be reasonably confident that when the numbers are known,
they will further underscore the Trump administration’s policy incoherence and
remind us of all of the damage he is prepared to inflict on the American
economy.

The president will most likely be apoplectic over data confirming that the
economy is generating very few new jobs (the payroll processor ADP estimated a
loss of 32,000 private sector jobs in September). Trump fired the head of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs numbers, after a
lackluster report published in August.

The New Norm, a sustainable textile startup

If you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come
across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are
beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very
difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.

But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an
opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,
during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that

fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw

Starbucks’ CEO, Brian Niccol, made 6,666 times more than his average worker

their workers.

The inequality gap between CEOs’ pay and that of their median workers rose in
2024 to 285 to 1 from 268 to 1 in 2023, according to a report released this
week by the largest federation of labor unions in the US, the AFL-CIO.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
