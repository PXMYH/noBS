            <!-- Published time -->
            <p>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 17:27:05 CST</p>
            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. reached a deal with retailers to reduce some of
their fees and give merchants more leeway to reject customers who use certain
credit cards, including the premium ones that have been surging in popularity.
The proposed settlement -- which is meant to bring more than 20 years of
litigation to an end -- could ultimately save merchants more than $200
billion, according to Joseph Stiglitz and Keith Leffler, who served as expert
economists in the case on behalf of the retailers. That would make it one of
the largest-ever class-action settlements of a US antitrust case. Bloomberg&#39;s

Magical thinking is indispensable to understanding Team Trump’s economic
policymaking. The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can
work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.

A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar

want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.

Drax power plant has continued to burn 250-year-old trees sourced from some of
Canada’s oldest forests despite growing scrutiny of its sustainability claims,
forestry experts say.

A new report suggests it is “highly likely” that Britain’s biggest power plant
sourced some wood from ecologically valuable forests as recently as this
summer. Drax, Britain’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, has
received billions of pounds in subsidies from burning biomass derived largely
from wood.

Small, medium and large American companies have asked the US Department of

facing extra tariffs because of their steel content, which hit items such as
Ikea tables with metal nuts and bolts and German combine harvesters.

Joy Reid hosted the 7pm hour on MSNBC for nearly five years, providing a daily
dose of progressive energy and verve that led into the network’s primetime
programming. Then, in late February, Reid was suddenly forced out, and her
show, The ReidOut, was cancelled as part of a broader programming shakeup at
the network. Reid has since launched her own streaming show, The Joy Reid
Show, and has a few things to say about the mainstream media she was once part
of.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
