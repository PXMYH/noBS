The Air India tragedy in Ahmedabad is the first time a Boeing 787 Dreamliner
has crashed since the plane’s introduction in 2011.

While airlines using the Boeing plane have had widespread problems with
engines on the 787 – resulting in many having to ground planes and reduce
flights – the 787’s safety record in service has so far been good.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>UK economy shrank by 0.3% in April, biggest fall since October 2023, as trade
with the US slumped.. but FTSE 100 ends at new record close

  * Full story: **UK economy shrinks by 0.3% as as exports hit by Trump trade war**

 **Nicholas Hyett,** Investment Manager at **Wealth Club** , blames “a
cocktail of headwinds to growth” for the 0.3% fall in UK GDP in April.

Hyett says:

In the very short term the change to Stamp Duty rules have put the legal and
property services on ice - with legal activities down 10.2% month-on-month.

New barriers to trade with the US and changes to employment costs, from a
higher living wage and increased national insurance contributions, are a
longer term challenge.

“The 0.3% m/m fall in real GDP in April supports our view that the strength in
Q1 was unsustainable. This won’t prompt the Bank of England to cut interest
rates next Thursday. But it is one more piece of news pointing to another cut
in August.”

We still expect the Bank Rate to be maintained at 4.25% in the June meeting,
to allow still troubling earnings growth to continue to ease. We anticipate
the next rate cuts to occur in the August and November meetings to 3.75%,
prompted by mounting economic hardships.”

While there is little chance of any change at next week’s meeting, we see a
strong possibility that the MPC ditches its hawkish bias, which could pave the
way for an August cut.”

787 Dreamliner operated by Air India that was bound for London, according to

in the worst accident involving the US planemaker’s most advanced twin-aisle
aircraft. Officials didn’t immediately say how many of those people were
passengers, crew or area residents. Flight AI171 was carrying 242 passengers
and crew. Video footage shared on social media showed a giant plume of smoke
engulfing the crash site. “We have found 204 bodies, we are looking for more
bodies,” Police Commissioner G.S. Malik told Bloomberg. “There is a chance
that there may be survivors. 41 injured are being treated. These include
people who were staying in the residential area.” (Source: Bloomberg)

The EU executive has called for lowering the price cap on Russian oil as it
seeks to tighten energy and financial sanctions against the Kremlin’s ability
to wage war.

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed that
western countries reduce the price at which Russian oil can be sold to $45

Chinese authorities have banned domestic banks from luring customers with
gifts including the hugely popular Labubu dolls, amid fierce competition among
lenders as interest rates and profit margins decline.

The Zhejiang branch of China’s financial regulator, the National Financial
Regulatory Administration, has asked local banks to refrain from offering non-
compliant perks to attract deposits, Bloomberg News reported.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Graphic sexual content, bullying, abuse and threats of violence are rife in
the metaverse – and the NSPCC says a huge proportion of online grooming
offences take place on Meta-owned products. Is it too late to change course?

Everybody knows that young women are not safe. They are not safe in the
street, where 86% of those aged 18 to 24 have experienced sexual harassment.
They are not safe at school, where 79% of young people told Ofsted that sexual
assault was common in their friendship groups and almost a third of 16- to
18-year-old girls report experiencing “unwanted sexual touching”. They are not
safe in swimming pools or parks, or at the beach. They are not even safe
online, with the children’s safety charity the NSPCC reporting that social
media sites are “failing to protect girls from harm at every stage”.

This will come as no surprise to any woman who has ever used social media. But
it is particularly relevant as Meta, the operator of some of the biggest
social platforms on the internet, is busily engaged in constructing a whole
new world. The company is pumping billions of dollars a year into building its
metaverse, a virtual world that it hopes will become the future not just of
socialising, but of education, business, shopping and live events. This raises
a simple question: if Meta has utterly failed to keep women and girls safe in
its existing online spaces, why should we trust it with the future?

            <p>Across the world, societies are reverting to oligarchies. How to resist? Fight
for democracy with all we’ve got

Seldom in recent history has class war been waged so blatantly. Generally,
billionaires and hectomillionaires employ concierges to attack the poor on
their behalf. But now, freed from shame and embarrassment, they no longer hide
their involvement. In the US, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, will lead
the federal assault on the middle and working classes: seeking to slash public
spending and the public protections defending people from predatory capital.

He shares responsibility for the Department of Government Efficiency with
another billionaire, Vivek Ramaswamy. They have been recruiting further
billionaires to oversee cuts across government. These plutocrats will not be
paid. They will wage their class war pro bono, out of the goodness of their
hearts.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business
through diversity programs found in supermarkets and chains like Kroger or
Target. Some Mena businesspeople say they feel the lack of recognition.

            <p>Professionals from poorer families earn almost £7,000 less per year than those
from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
