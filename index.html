            <p>Texas has long been under threat from the launches and explosions of SpaceX
rockets. Now Hawaii is emerging as another possible victim

The north-west Hawaiian island of Mokumanamana is said to be touched by the
gods. Bisected by the Tropic of Cancer latitude line, it is deep in the
Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs
give way to indigo blue waters dotted with monk seals and stony coral. No
humans have lived on Mokumanamana, but it has the world’s highest density of
ancient Hawaiian religious sites.

“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the
darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of
Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes,
their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up
to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re
met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can
pass into _pō_ and be with their ancestors, who inhabit the Pacific waters
west of Mokumanamana.

Europe’s largest missiles maker, MBDA, is selling key components for bombs
that have been shipped in their thousands to Israel and used in multiple
airstrikes where research indicates Palestinian children and other civilians
were killed.

With concerns mounting about the extent to which European companies may be
profiting from the devastation of Gaza, a Guardian investigation with the
independent newsrooms Disclose and Follow the Money has examined the supply
chain behind the GBU-39 bomb, and the ways in which it has been deployed
during the conflict.

with the same period last year, with a sharp decline emerging in May – one

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the
US – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that

Since the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their
businesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier
Development Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA). Until
last July, one group of business owners was noticeably absent from the sea of
certification options – those of Mena (Middle East and north Africa) heritage.

Recognition as a minority business has its advantages. In the consumer goods
sector, certified businesses let customers know who is making their simmer
sauces or importing their coffee beans. But more crucially, especially for
scrappy emerging brands, certifications can reduce the cost of doing business

            <p>When partners consider finances, when is it ‘my’ money, and when it is ‘our’
money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
