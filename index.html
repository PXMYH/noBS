your phones – how we pay for things has changed forever. But while our options
have changed, and are still changing, some small business owners seem
determined to either keep us counting bills or jump feet first into their idea
of the future.

Case in point from my home town: the owner of the restaurant in South
Philadelphia who “doesn’t accept credit cards” and instead forces their
customers to use an ATM machine which – conveniently – charges a $4.50 fee to

Each man enters the room, one by one, escaping the dark night outside. Before
long some two dozen are sitting in a horseshoe. They hail from different
worlds and different generations, but have been united by the same problem.

For decades, Gamblers Anonymous (GA) has offered compulsive gamblers a place
to share their stories, and listen to others, in the hope of turning their
lives around. Veterans of the 12-step program say it is now experiencing a
sharp rise in interest from troubled young addicts.

A major shift in how Americans buy homes could come this summer after a

rule that dictates how real estate agents are compensated.

If the settlement is approved by a judge, the rule change will start in mid-
July, leaving the real estate industry scrambling over what the future of
buying or selling a home will look like.

The Dutch airline KLM has misled customers with vague environmental claims and

misleading advertising in 15 of the 19 environmental statements it assessed.
They include claims that the airline is moving towards a “more sustainable”
future and statements on its website about the benefits of offsetting a
flight.

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Organized labor across the country is now setting its sights on housing costs
as rents and mortgages continue to soar

As housing has become a top issue in strikes and protests in recent months, US
unions are pushing for change and backing innovative solutions for the housing
affordability crisis.

With US house prices and rents rising in recent years, and high interest rates
and inflation taking their toll, housing affordability has become a major
issue at the bargaining table for US labor unions. Many workers are facing
60-, 90-, even 120-minute commutes to work because they cannott afford to live
near their jobs.

            <!-- Summary -->
            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

from wealthier ones, despite businesses claiming to act on social mobility  

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

money? Guardian readers shared their experiences

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
