water, we don’t have a water level on the soda machine, the ice machine is
broken, so we have to buy water. The last few weeks it’s been extremely hot.

Spending on artificial intelligence could hit a staggering $1tn, according to
analysts concerned about whether there will be a return on such a spree. Mark
Zuckerberg’s answer this week to such jitters was to release his latest AI
system for free.

Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B is its most powerful yet, it says, and one of the most
capable in the world. While the tech company didn’t disclose how much it cost
to train, Zuckerberg, its co-founder and chief executive, has previously
disclosed a $10.5bn (£8.9bn) investment in just the chips required to power

            <p>The world’s biggest basketball league had steady but unspectacular ratings
last season but its blockbuster deal could predict the future of sports
broadcasting

If there were ever any doubts that the future of television is streaming, the
NBA just put them to rest. After months of protracted negotiations over the
11-year media rights deal set to begin in 2025, the NBA announced last night
it has signed deals with incumbent Disney’s ESPN, which was already a rights
holders, and new partners, NBCUniversal and Amazon. What’s even more
remarkable than the eye-watering $76bn price tag, is just what the deal
tacitly predicts for the future of sports coverage.

When Jesse Motte began working at a Starbucks inside a Target store in
Columbia, South Carolina, more than two years ago, $15 an hour sounded great.
He was excited to start because it was the most he had ever made after working
for years in the service industry.

The excitement has dissipated due to his inconsistent and erratic work
schedule, the rising costs of necessities and the minuscule raises he and his
co-workers receive annually. His most recent annual wage increase was $0.37 an
hour.

have become so unaffordable they are ‘barely livable’

The American dream of owning your own home is dead, according to the majority
of renters surveyed in a new poll shared exclusively with the Guardian, and
the areas they live in have become so unaffordable they are “barely livable”.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice,
asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along
with other demographic information. Those polled were asked their opinion on
home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook
is bleak.

            <p>Clio Goodman’s bakery is making a splash in Brooklyn, and now she wants to
take it to the next level with packaged cake mix

The baked goods corner of social media is rife with images of gooey and salt-
and sprinkle-flecked treats. But working diligently from a spacious facility
in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn – with a focus on creating memorable,
if occasionally messy, cakes – Clio Goodman has managed to secure an enviably
robust following.

Describing bakers as “artists” has become an industry cliche, but in Goodman’s
case, the cakes she sells at ByClio are very much works of art – both despite
and because of their imperfections. She’s less interested in scoring likes
than making pieces that beguile, and her petal-strewn cakes call to mind
edible flower crowns. “People often say the way I frost my cakes has a
painterly quality to it,” Goodman says.

It’s no surprise that social class can affect your life chances, but recently
the education secretary highlighted the problem with a stark statistic.

Children who show signs of low academic ability at the age of five, but who
come from high-income families, are 35% more likely to become high earners
than those who show signs of high ability but come from poorer families, said
Justine Greening.

  * Private lives: ‘I want to end my marriage but I’m financially dependent’  

A survey of about 1,000 Americans found that one in 10 would describe their
partner as a financial bully. Our readers, however, insist that that might be
a label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially
responsible.

When we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had
similar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions
described as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that
keeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being
financially responsible.
