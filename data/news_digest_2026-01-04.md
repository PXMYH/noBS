    "summary": "The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily administer Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies set to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. While Venezuela’s Supreme Court has granted temporary presidential powers to Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, the U.S. has effectively taken control, prompting airspace closures over the Caribbean and disruptions to global oil shipments. Meanwhile, North Korea escalated tensions by launching ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, underscoring regional instability. In diplomatic news, China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, while Japan faces economic retaliation from Beijing over its stance on Taiwan, including a ban on Japanese scallops. The oil market remains largely unaffected by the Venezuela crisis, with analysts suggesting global supplies can absorb any short-term disruptions.",

    "summary": "Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism, as the S&P 500 inched higher amid mixed signals. Semiconductor stocks led gains, buoyed by anticipation for the CES tech conference, while concerns over stretched valuations and inflation lingered. The Federal Reserve faces a divided path forward, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson suggesting modest rate cuts later in the year, though minutes from December’s meeting revealed deep splits among officials over whether inflation or unemployment poses the greater risk. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Saks Global replaced its CEO as bankruptcy rumors swirled, while private equity firm Oakley Capital explored a £500 million sale of London estate agency Dexters. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply from record highs and oil fluctuating amid supply surplus concerns. Ethiopia also reached a deal-in-principle with bondholders to restructure $1 billion in defaulted debt, offering a rare bright spot in emerging markets.",
