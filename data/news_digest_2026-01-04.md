    "summary": "The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily administer Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies set to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. While Venezuela’s Supreme Court has granted temporary presidential powers to Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, the U.S. has effectively taken control, prompting airspace closures over the Caribbean and disruptions to global oil shipments. Meanwhile, North Korea escalated tensions by launching ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, underscoring regional instability. In diplomatic news, China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, while Japan faces economic retaliation from Beijing over its stance on Taiwan, including a ban on Japanese scallops. The oil market remains largely unaffected by the Venezuela crisis, with analysts suggesting global supplies can absorb any short-term disruptions.",
