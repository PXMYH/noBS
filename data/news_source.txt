In 1990, 943 million\npeople there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the\npopulation, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down\nto zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4\nmillion Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less\nthan $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.\n\nThe data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable\nsuccess. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European\npeers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of\nwork. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that\nmuch further ahead.\n\nContinue reading...\n\n"
