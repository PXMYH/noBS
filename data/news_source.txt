It’s not a push he needs.\n\nAndrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger\ncompanies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes\nwas far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s\nbeen swimming naked.)\n\nIn our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction,\ncarrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.\n\nParticipants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone\nseeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also\nwhom they are sleeping with.\n\nFrom this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for\nambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives\nbooks: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that\nare required.\n\nWhen downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors\ncarrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.\n\nNaturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s\npromised to attend _my_ 100th.\n\nShe sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After\nretiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other\nBerkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)\n\nThe candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to\nwork for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.\n\n(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the\nportfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term\n‘thinking outside the box’.)\n\nContinue reading...\n\n"

    "summary": "Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the\nUS – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that\n\nSince the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their\nbusinesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier\nDevelopment Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA).
