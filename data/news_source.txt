In 1990, 943 million\npeople there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the\npopulation, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down\nto zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4\nmillion Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less\nthan $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.\n\nThe data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable\nsuccess.

Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are\nbeloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very\ndifficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.\n\nBut Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an\nopportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019,\nduring her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that\ncould spin plastic waste into textile filaments.
