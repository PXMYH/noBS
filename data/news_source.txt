    "summary": "Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, with gold and\ndefence company shares also higher today\n\n  * **What role could the US play in Venezuela’s ‘bust’ oil industry?**\n\n**The oil price remains in the red this morning, with Brent crude now down 1%\nat $60.15 per barrel.**\n\nAnalysts are in broad agreement that while the Venezuela attack is unlikely to\nboost demand for oil, it also won’t lead to a rapid surge in supply.\n\nThe question is, will traders focus on the potential for future Venezuelan oil\nflooding the market, which could tank the oil price, or will they focus on how\nmuch investment will be needed to get Venezuela to pump more oil? Right now,\nVenezuela pumps less than 1 million barrels per day, at its peak in 1998,\nbefore socialist dictators took control, it was pumping out nearly 3.5 million\nbarrels per day. To get back to this level will take hundreds of billions of\ndollars in investment, which President Trump has said will partly come from US\noil companies.\n\nHowever, the type of investments needed including upgrading old and decaying\ninfrastructure, drilling new oil wells and building more refineries to process\nVenezuela’s heavy crude oil. Optimizing resource-rich Venezuela to generate\nthe income needed to turn the country around could take until 2030 and beyond,\naccording to some oil analysts. Thus, any decline in the price of oil at the\nstart of this week could be short lived.\n\n“The reported capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro might be a\ngeopolitical shock, but for markets it’s not an oil-price earthquake.\nVenezuela accounts for roughly 1% of global supply, and even in a best-case\npolitical outcome, restoring production would take years. Most of the\ndisruption risk is already priced in, meaning this is a slow-moving structural\nstory rather than a trigger for sustained oil price moves.\n\n“For investors, the earliest impact is likely to appear in US refining, where\nheavy Venezuelan crude fits existing infrastructure. Refiners with exposure to\ncomplex facilities may see improved economics at the margin, while Canadian\noil sands producers face increased competition over time.\n\nContinue reading...\n\n"

Our readers, however, insist that that might be\na label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially\nresponsible.\n\nWhen we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had\nsimilar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions\ndescribed as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that\nkeeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being\nfinancially responsible.\n\nContinue reading...\n\n"
