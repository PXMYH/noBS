In 1990, 943 million\npeople there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the\npopulation, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the number was brought down\nto zero. Unfortunately, the United States was not as successful. More than 4\nmillion Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less\nthan $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.\n\nThe data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable\nsuccess.
