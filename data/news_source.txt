But during that period, the biggest single-day\ngross posted by any release wasn’t really a gross – or a movie. It was the\nseries finale of the Netflix TV show Stranger Things.\n\nNetflix made a deal to put the feature-length episode in theaters\nsimultaneously with its streaming debut, and estimates put the numbers for the\n24 hours’ worth of shows, beginning at 8pm on New Year’s Eve and continuing\nthroughout New Year’s Day, around $25m. That’s bigger than any single day of\nAvatar: Fire and Ash after its opening weekend. In fact, if the Stranger\nThings release banked over $30m, as some estimated, that would make it the\nsecond-biggest 24 hours for any release in December, beaten only by Avatar 3’s\nopening day.\n\nContinue reading...\n\n"
