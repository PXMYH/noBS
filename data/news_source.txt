    "summary": "Middle Eastern and north African business owners couldn’t get certified in the\nUS – but a new wave of entrepreneurs is changing that\n\nSince the 1970s, many minority business owners have been able to certify their\nbusinesses through organizations like the National Minority Supplier\nDevelopment Council (NMSDC) or the Small Business Administration (SBA).
