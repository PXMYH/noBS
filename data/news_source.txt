Our readers, however, insist that that might be\na label easily assigned to a partner who is simply being financially\nresponsible.\n\nWhen we put out a call to out readers last week to see if any of them had\nsimilar experiences, we found that many of you wouldn’t define the actions\ndescribed as financial bullying. Instead, quite a number of you insisted that\nkeeping track of your partner’s expenses was simply budgeting and being\nfinancially responsible.\n\nContinue reading...\n\n"
