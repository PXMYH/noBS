## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate this week's headlines, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign sees 69 high-ranking officials punished, reinforcing President Xi Jinping's ongoing crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential economic shifts with plans to suspend food sales taxes—a move tied to her election campaign. The U.S. remains a focal point as the Trump administration halts immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting controversial claims over Venezuela's oil reserves, though energy giants show reluctance to engage.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures as 2026 begins. President Donald Trump’s threats to sue JPMorgan over alleged debanking and his push for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates are rattling financial institutions, with banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo reporting weak earnings amid regulatory uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces scrutiny after transcripts revealed Chair Jerome Powell’s past policy missteps, while a DOJ investigation into Powell’s actions adds to the tension. Central bank independence remains a flashpoint, with Fed officials warning that political interference could reignite inflation. Overseas, the Bank of Japan’s upcoming meeting has yen traders on edge amid election uncertainty, while the EU threatens to halt a U.S. trade deal over Trump’s tariff threats. Corporate highlights include Novo Nordisk’s 8% stock surge on strong Wegovy sales, Saudi Arabia’s aggressive tourism push under Vision 2030, and the collapse of Saks Global into bankruptcy after its risky Neiman Marcus acquisition. Tech and energy sectors are also in focus, with Coinbase flexing its political muscle in Washington and Goldman Sachs exploring prediction markets as a new frontier.
