## 🌍 World & Politics

Global energy markets and geopolitical tensions dominate this week’s headlines, with Russia’s oil and gas revenues plummeting to a five-year low in 2025, dealing a significant blow to its war chest for the Ukraine conflict. The decline, driven by falling crude prices and reduced gas exports, underscores the economic strain on Moscow amid prolonged sanctions. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, who view domestic production as a more stable alternative. Trump’s controversial stance—including his self-declared role as Venezuela’s acting president—raises concerns about potential economic fallout for the U.S., with critics arguing his approach risks destabilizing markets rather than securing long-term gains. In a separate move, the Trump administration suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Iran, Russia, and Brazil, citing welfare concerns in a sweeping expansion of its restrictive immigration policies. On the diplomatic front, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair frayed Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S. economic ties with key partners grow increasingly uncertain. The visit signals Ottawa’s pivot toward diversifying its markets amid rising global tensions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets and corporate America are grappling with a mix of policy shifts, earnings pressures, and strategic pivots as 2026 unfolds. Major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup, report mixed earnings, with wealth management and trading revenues providing bright spots amid concerns over President Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates—a move that has banks scrambling to protect their lucrative card businesses. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs stands out with strong profits in equities and asset management, even as it explores new ventures like prediction markets and a $12 billion bond sale. The retail sector faces turmoil as Saks Global, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, files for bankruptcy after a debt-fueled acquisition backfires, while Amazon threatens legal action to protect its $475 million stake in the failed deal. On the energy front, U.S. refiners stand to gain from Trump’s tightening control over Venezuelan oil, though silver prices retreat after the administration holds off on critical mineral tariffs. Central bank independence remains a flashpoint, with Fed Governor Goolsbee warning that undermining it could reignite inflation, even as China’s record $1.19 trillion trade surplus underscores global economic imbalances.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape is dominated by major policy shifts and market reactions this week. President Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X, citing national security concerns, sends shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the blow. The move coincides with a broader push to expand U.S. chip manufacturing, as a potential trade deal with Taiwan could see TSMC build more plants in America. Meanwhile, markets rebound on strong tech earnings, with AI-driven growth reigniting investor optimism, though earlier volatility tied to China’s DeepSeek AI advancements highlights lingering tensions in the sector. Beyond tech, Boeing outperforms Airbus in deliveries for the first time since 2018, while JPMorgan faces pressure amid declining profits and leadership succession questions. Regulatory battles also take center stage, with Mastercard, Visa, and Revolut losing a UK lawsuit over card fee caps, and labor unions accusing the Trump administration of echoing divisive rhetoric. The UK economy shows unexpected resilience with 0.3% growth in November, buoyed by recovery in sectors like automotive, while the obesity drug market braces for a transformative year with new oral GLP-1 treatments from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly on the horizon.
