## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with geopolitical and domestic developments shaping international relations. In the U.S., President Trump's aggressive trade stance continues to unsettle markets, as he threatens a new trade war even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority. His speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he renounced liberal democratic principles, signals a further retreat from global leadership, leaving a vacuum China is quick to fill. Meanwhile, domestic unrest grows, with Minnesota residents staging a widespread strike to protest ICE operations, demanding the agency's removal from the state amid allegations of constitutional violations. The Pentagon's attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*—criticized as 'woke'—sparks pushback from lawmakers and the outlet's leadership, highlighting ongoing struggles over institutional independence. Economically, wheat prices surge on fears of crop damage from freezing weather in the U.S. and Russia, compounding concerns over food security amid broader geopolitical instability. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to Tether's USDT stablecoin as a hedge against economic and political turmoil, underscoring the growing reliance on cryptocurrencies in unstable regimes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing a shift in sentiment as investors rotate away from US assets, with Brazil's equity benchmark hitting record highs and emerging markets drawing increased foreign investment. Meanwhile, US consumer sentiment surged to a five-month high, buoying stocks despite a volatile week that saw the S&P 500 extend its decline. The dollar weakened amid policy uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting, while oil prices rose on a weaker dollar and geopolitical tensions. Corporate activity remains brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's preparations for a potential $800 billion IPO. However, concerns linger over private credit risks and the Fed's independence, as Trump's lawsuit against JPMorgan and political pressures add to market unease.

The IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with young workers facing the brunt of the impact, while Big Tech ramps up debt issuance to fund AI ambitions, hitting a record $108.7 billion in Q4 bonds. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang plans a strategic visit to China amid stalling AI chip sales, underscoring the high stakes in the global AI race. Meanwhile, TikTok’s corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about app changes for its 200 million American users, as a consortium with ties to Trump finalizes the deal. Regulatory tensions also flare, with the FCC cracking down on late-night TV political appearances and European regulators potentially blocking Warner Bros.
