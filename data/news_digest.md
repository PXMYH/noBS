## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week, with Venezuela at the center of a high-stakes power struggle. President Trump’s aggressive push to secure Venezuelan oil—including a $100 billion investment plan and claims to 50 million barrels—faces skepticism from major oil executives wary of political instability. The ouster of Nicolás Maduro has eased border tensions with Guyana, benefiting its booming oil sector, while Mexico’s oil shipments to Cuba further strain U.S. relations in the region. Meanwhile, China watches Trump’s Latin America maneuvers closely, having already established deep economic ties there. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on amid wartime challenges, while the UK grapples with fallout from a minister’s Taiwan visit, which nearly derailed key trade talks with China.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical shifts, corporate maneuvering, and economic policy changes in early 2026. The U.S. stock market, while still buoyed by AI optimism, is being outpaced by international equities as investors diversify away from the dollar. Defense stocks are surging amid global instability, while gold remains a favored safe haven despite its record 2025 rally. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector—aiming to slash U.S. oil prices to $50 a barrel—faces skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which demand major reforms before investing. On the corporate front, a potential $260 billion merger between mining titans Rio Tinto and Glencore is gaining traction, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions. The Fed remains cautious on rate cuts, waiting for clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as low inflation fuels growth in India and Egypt. In financial markets, BlackRock predicts a surge in retail crypto adoption, while Saks Global teeters on the brink of bankruptcy. The housing sector shows signs of balancing, though Trump’s mortgage bond directive and crackdown on institutional homebuyers add volatility. Meanwhile, JPMorgan’s takeover of the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs marks a strategic shift in consumer finance.
