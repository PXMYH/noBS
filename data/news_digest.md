## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate headlines this week, with significant actions from major powers. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign sees 69 high-ranking officials punished, underscoring President Xi Jinping’s ongoing crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential economic shifts as she considers suspending food sales taxes—a move tied to her election campaign promises. In the U.S., the Trump administration tightens immigration policies by halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting controversial claims over Venezuela’s oil reserves, though energy giants remain hesitant to engage. On the security front, the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, advising caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and seeking greater Defense Department control.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate earnings this week. In Asia, Hong Kong plans to deepen financial ties with Shanghai through a gold exchange agreement, while China's rare-earth exports decline amid rising tensions with Japan. The Bank of Japan's upcoming meeting keeps yen traders on edge as investors speculate on rate hikes, complicated by looming elections. Meanwhile, the EU threatens to halt a trade deal with the U.S. over President Trump's tariff threats, adding to transatlantic economic strains. On Wall Street, equities are charging into a high-stakes earnings season with strong momentum, though banks face pressure from Trump's proposed 10% credit card rate cap—a move industry leaders are resisting. Corporate highlights include Novo Nordisk's 8% stock surge on strong Wegovy sales, while Stellantis focuses on executing its turnaround strategy. The Fed remains a focal point, with newly released 2020 transcripts revealing Jerome Powell's internal debates over rate guidance, even as Trump escalates attacks on the central bank's independence. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 tourism push and Coinbase's growing influence in Washington underscore shifting economic priorities and regulatory battles.
