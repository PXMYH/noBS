## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, as his extradition to New York on charges sends shockwaves through geopolitical and financial markets. The move, described by President Trump as part of a broader plan to 'run' Venezuela, leaves the country in a state of uncertainty, with Maduro pleading not guilty while his regime remains in power for now. Bondholders are scrambling to assess the implications for Venezuela’s $60 billion in defaulted debt, and analysts warn of potential shifts in the global order as China’s oil deals with Caracas hang in the balance. Meanwhile, hedge funds ramp up bullish oil bets amid speculation over U.S. military intervention, though experts downplay Venezuela’s immediate impact on OPEC markets. Beyond Venezuela, tensions flare between China and the West, with Beijing threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and imposing a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on despite wartime disruptions, while global airlines cancel flights after the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace citing safety risks tied to the Venezuela operation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a mix of optimism and caution, as equities extended record rallies despite geopolitical tensions. Asian stocks climbed to new highs, while the S&P 500's energy sector surged 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela's oil potential following Nicolas Maduro's capture. Copper hit a record above $13,000 per ton, driven by strong U.S. demand, though silver futures retreated sharply after a volatile run. Meanwhile, central banks remain in focus, with the Fed's December minutes revealing deep divisions over further rate cuts amid lingering inflation concerns. Corporate activity also dominated headlines, including BlueScope Steel's $8.8 billion takeover bid and Jollibee Foods' plans for a U.S. listing of its international business. However, challenges persist, with Saks Global preparing for bankruptcy and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolving after federal funding cuts. Investors are closely watching economic indicators, including Friday's December jobs report, which could signal more rate cuts ahead.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape kicks off 2026 with significant shifts in AI, automotive, and global markets. China's Kuaishou Technology sees its stock surge 84% after a rapid pivot to AI video generation, highlighting the growing dominance of AI-driven innovations. Meanwhile, BYD overtakes Tesla as the world's top electric vehicle seller, underscoring China's expanding influence in the EV market amid Tesla's slumping sales following the withdrawal of U.S. subsidies. In financial markets, leveraged bets on Taiwan stocks hit a 17-year high, reflecting strong risk appetite, while U.S. stocks rise alongside oil prices following geopolitical developments in Venezuela. Regulatory and legal challenges also take center stage, with Ørsted filing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over a suspended offshore wind farm project, and China tightening AI chatbot regulations around sensitive topics like suicide and gambling. The energy sector remains volatile, with Chevron positioning itself to capitalize on Venezuela's oil industry revival, though analysts warn of steep costs and long timelines for recovery.
