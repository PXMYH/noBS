## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with the Trump administration pushing to lift sanctions and secure Venezuelan oil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signals potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales, while major traders like Vitol and Trafigura engage US refiners over Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain hesitant due to political and financial risks, despite Trump’s $100 billion investment pitch. The shift in Venezuela also eases tensions for Guyana, which faces reduced border-conflict risks amid its oil boom. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipments to Cuba heighten US-Cuba tensions, underscoring regional power struggles. Elsewhere, Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, while China watches US Latin America maneuvers closely, having already established deep economic ties in the region. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases. In Europe, China previously threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, revealing ongoing diplomatic friction.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh mixed economic signals. U.S. inflation shows signs of stabilizing, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s measured approach to rate cuts, though labor market strength remains a key watchpoint. Meanwhile, geopolitical and commodity dynamics take center stage, with President Trump’s aggressive push to nationalize Venezuela’s oil industry sparking both skepticism from energy giants like Exxon and a speculative rally in Venezuelan bonds. In corporate news, a potential $260 billion merger between mining titans Rio Tinto and Glencore reignites, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back EV ambitions. Gold retains its luster after a record 2025 rally, and defense stocks surge amid global instability, reflecting a shift in investor priorities. Elsewhere, India’s 7.4% growth draws scrutiny over its sustainability, and Hong Kong’s stock stamp duty boosts fiscal prospects. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though affordability concerns persist as Trump targets institutional homebuyers and caps credit card rates, drawing bank backlash.
