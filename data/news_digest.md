## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines this week. In Australia, the government is pushing forward with controversial hate speech legislation while simultaneously searching for a new ambassador to the U.S. after Kevin Rudd’s early departure. Meanwhile, Japan faces financial turbulence as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s proposed tax cuts on food trigger a bond market sell-off, driving 40-year yields to a record 4%. The move reflects investor skepticism over her economic policies ahead of elections. In Latin America, the FAA issues warnings about increased military activity near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, advising pilots to exercise caution over parts of the Pacific Ocean. The advisory underscores rising regional tensions, though details on the specific threats remain unclear. Economically, Venezuela’s ongoing instability continues to drive locals toward cryptocurrencies like USDT as a hedge against hyperinflation and political volatility, highlighting the broader trend of digital assets gaining traction in unstable regimes. Elsewhere, former President Donald Trump’s renewed interest in Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from U.S. energy giants, who view domestic production as a safer and more cost-effective alternative despite Trump’s self-proclaimed authority over the country’s resources.
