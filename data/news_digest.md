## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week's headlines, with Canada and the UK navigating delicate relations with China. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dispatches former Bank of England governor Mark Carney to Beijing in a bid to repair strained ties and secure new trade opportunities, signaling Ottawa's push to diversify markets amid worsening U.S.-China relations. Meanwhile, the UK faces diplomatic fallout after China threatened to cancel key trade talks following a British minister's visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing's sensitivity over the island's status. In a separate development, former U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive pursuit of Venezuela's oil resources draws criticism, with analysts warning his approach could undermine America's long-term economic influence. On the ground in Ukraine, resilience defines the business sector as Nemiroff, a leading vodka producer, expands exports to UK retailers despite ongoing Russian airstrikes disrupting supply chains. The contrasting narratives—diplomatic brinkmanship, resource grabs, and wartime economic adaptation—highlight the fragile balance of power and persistence amid global instability.
