## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines this week, with significant developments in trade, diplomacy, and domestic policy. The U.S. government is making strategic moves to bolster domestic industries, taking a $1.6 billion stake in USA Rare Earth to secure critical mineral supplies, while the UK plans to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut and rising protectionism. Meanwhile, Japan’s yen strengthens as officials hint at potential market intervention, reflecting ongoing economic volatility. In Latin America, Colombia’s Grupo Argos eyes a return to Venezuela following the removal of Nicolás Maduro, signaling potential economic shifts in the region. However, U.S. sanctions and political instability continue to complicate investment opportunities, with Venezuelans increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies like USDT to hedge against economic uncertainty. Domestically, President Trump’s threats of a new trade war and a federal court’s review of his tariff authority underscore growing tensions over U.S. trade policy, while mass protests in Minnesota highlight escalating opposition to federal immigration enforcement.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

U.S. stocks advanced on Monday as investors looked past geopolitical risks and focused on strong corporate earnings and upcoming tech results, though insurers faced pressure after reports of flat Medicare payment rates. Gold and silver prices surged to record highs, with gold topping $5,000 per ounce for the first time, driven by global uncertainty and a weakening U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Treasury yields dipped following robust demand at a two-year note auction, reinforcing expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. In corporate news, Capital One announced a $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex, while New Fortress Energy worked on a restructuring deal with creditors. The market also saw heightened volatility in commodities, with natural gas jumping nearly 30% amid cold weather, and Ecuador returning to global debt markets with a $4 billion bond sale.

## ⚽ Sports

The Washington Post reverses its initial decision to skip in-person coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, announcing it will now send a small team of reporters just weeks before the Games begin. The abrupt change follows widespread criticism of the paper's earlier plan to rely solely on remote reporting, underscoring the significance of on-the-ground journalism for major global events. Meanwhile, in golf, Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf continues its controversial partnership with former President Donald Trump, confirming another tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This marks at least the sixth event hosted at Trump properties since the breakaway league's inception, further cementing the alliance between the two entities. The move reignites debates over sportswashing and the intersection of politics and sports.
