## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as Europe grapples with US President Donald Trump’s aggressive stance on Greenland’s sovereignty, sparking debates over potential economic countermeasures, including the weaponization of $10 trillion in US assets. Meanwhile, Trump’s self-declared authority over Venezuela raises eyebrows, with analysts questioning the feasibility of his plans to exploit the country’s oil reserves amid domestic alternatives. In Latin America, the FAA issues warnings about military activity near Pacific airspace, urging caution for flights over Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling heightened regional instability. On the economic front, the European Central Bank begins its search for a new vice president, a move that could shape the future leadership of the institution as Christine Lagarde’s term nears its end. Additionally, Venezuela’s economic crisis drives locals toward stablecoins like USDT as a hedge against political and financial volatility, underscoring the broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in unstable regimes.
