## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about military activity near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, raising concerns over regional stability. On the domestic front, former President Trump makes financial moves, purchasing $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds after hinting at involvement in their merger approval, while his administration's aggressive stance on Venezuela's oil resources faces skepticism from major energy firms. The entertainment industry also sees a shake-up as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking a shift in leadership for the 'Star Wars' franchise.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open the week under pressure as President Trump’s threat of new tariffs on eight European countries over Greenland sparks risk aversion, weighing on European equities and straining US-EU trade relations. The EU retaliates by halting approval of a key trade deal, while investors grapple with geopolitical uncertainty amid a fourth consecutive year of strong equity returns. Meanwhile, corporate earnings take center stage, with mixed results: Novo Nordisk surges 8% on strong Wegovy sales, while major US banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo report disappointing profits, partly due to Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates—a policy banks are fiercely resisting. In central banking, the Fed faces scrutiny after transcripts reveal Chair Powell’s 2020 rate guidance missteps, while the Bank of Japan keeps markets on edge ahead of a potential rate hike. Elsewhere, sovereign wealth funds and private credit deals flood emerging markets, and Saudi Arabia doubles down on its Vision 2030 tourism push to diversify from oil. Gold demand soars as central banks, including Serbia’s, stockpile the metal amid dollar skepticism, while cryptocurrency firms like Coinbase flex political muscle in Washington, derailing a Senate crypto bill.
