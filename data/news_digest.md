Global trade tensions escalate as President Donald Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariffs if it pursues a trade deal with China, signaling a potential new front in his protectionist agenda. Meanwhile, the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut driven by Chinese production, reflecting a broader shift toward economic nationalism. In Venezuela, despite Trump's interest in U.S. investment, lingering sanctions complicate business opportunities, while locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT to hedge against economic instability.

## ⚽ Sports

The sports world sees major developments as the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, with the Washington Post abruptly scrapping its coverage plans just weeks before the Games begin in Italy, signaling potential logistical or editorial challenges. Meanwhile, in golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf league continues to strengthen its ties with the Trump Organization, announcing another tournament at the former president’s New Jersey resort—marking at least the sixth event hosted at Trump properties in four years. The move underscores LIV Golf’s strategic alignment with high-profile venues amid its ongoing rivalry with traditional golf tours. Elsewhere, the sports media landscape faces disruption as outlets grapple with last-minute Olympic preparations, while LIV Golf’s expansion highlights the growing influence of private investment in reshaping professional sports.
