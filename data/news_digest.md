## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Ukraine faces a massive Russian drone and missile attack, even as US, Russian, and Ukrainian officials continue negotiations in the UAE to seek a resolution to the prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive economic policies take center stage, with threats of new tariffs on European wine and a broader trade war, while his administration’s stance at the World Economic Forum signals a retreat from liberal democratic leadership, ceding influence to China. Domestic unrest in the US escalates as tens of thousands in Minnesota stage protests against ICE, demanding the agency’s removal from the state. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins amid ongoing sanctions and political uncertainty, while Trump’s push for US investment in the country faces hurdles due to lingering restrictions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policy decisions rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, with silver surging past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high as traders sought safe havens amid turmoil. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, while the yen strengthened on speculation of Japanese currency intervention, potentially with U.S. support. Meanwhile, President Trump’s abrupt reversal on European tariffs and legal battle with JPMorgan added to market whiplash, though his retreat on tariffs briefly lifted equities. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s reported $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO. Private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19%, while emerging markets and commodities benefited from a 'quiet-quitting' of U.S. assets.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire, announcing its latest tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This marks at least the sixth event hosted at a Trump property in the past four years, underscoring the league’s strategic partnership with the Trump brand. The move highlights LIV Golf’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a major player in the golfing world, leveraging high-profile venues and political connections to attract attention and investment. Meanwhile, the league’s expansion raises questions about the broader implications for the sport, as traditional golf tours face increasing competition from the well-funded upstart.
