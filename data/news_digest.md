## 🌍 World & Politics

The dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces dominates global headlines, sparking geopolitical and economic shockwaves. Maduro pleaded not guilty in a New York court to narco-terrorism charges, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal battle with far-reaching implications. The ouster disrupts Venezuela’s oil industry, sending ripples through global markets—Canada’s heavy crude prices slump, while oil traders weigh the future of Venezuelan production. China’s oil deals with Caracas now face uncertainty, as Beijing grapples with billions in loans tied to the ousted regime. Meanwhile, tensions flare between the U.S. and Colombia after a diplomatic spat, and airlines cancel flights as the FAA closes Caribbean airspace citing safety risks. Beyond Venezuela, China’s diplomatic pressures intensify, with threats to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and a ban on Japanese scallops as punishment for Tokyo’s Taiwan stance. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff push forward despite wartime challenges, while global debates over AI in education and China’s rare earths dominance underscore broader economic and technological shifts.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with a mix of optimism and geopolitical caution, as U.S. stocks rose despite tensions following Venezuela’s leadership upheaval. The S&P 500’s energy sector surged 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela’s oil potential, while gold and silver spiked amid heightened risk sentiment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields dipped after weak U.S. manufacturing data, reinforcing expectations of modest Fed rate cuts. Corporate activity saw Comcast’s Versant spinoff debut with a 13% drop, while Saks Global’s CEO exit and potential bankruptcy underscored retail sector strains. In global markets, Saudi Arabia slashed oil prices for Asia and launched an $11.5 billion bond sale, while Australia faced capital outflows due to rate risks and weak profits. The Fed’s internal divide over rate cuts and inflation risks looms large, with Minneapolis Fed’s Kashkari signaling limited easing ahead. High-grade bond issuance surged, led by GM and Williams Cos., as banks snapped up mortgage bonds amid relaxed capital rules. Elsewhere, SpaceX’s anticipated IPO and China’s silver export restrictions added to the year’s early volatility.
