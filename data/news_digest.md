## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate headlines this week, with significant actions from major powers. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in 69 senior officials facing punishment, underscoring President Xi Jinping's ongoing efforts to consolidate power and root out graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential economic policy shifts, including a proposed suspension of food sales taxes—a move likely aimed at bolstering public support ahead of elections. In the U.S., the Trump administration tightens immigration policies by halting visa processing for 75 countries, citing welfare concerns, while also making controversial financial moves, such as purchasing bonds in Netflix and Warner Bros. following their merger announcement. Geopolitical tensions rise as the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, and Venezuela secures its first LPG export deal, marking a potential economic lifeline amid U.S. sanctions. The Pentagon's overhaul of the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* further highlights domestic political divisions, as the administration seeks greater control over media perceived as 'woke.'

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic optimism and political uncertainty as earnings season kicks off. Equities continue their upward trajectory, with the Russell 2000 rallying as small caps outperform, while German industrial stocks show signs of recovery, fueling broader European gains. However, corporate performance is uneven: HDFC Bank beats estimates on strong loan growth, but major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo fall short amid concerns over Trump’s proposed 10% credit card rate cap, which banks fiercely oppose. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces renewed scrutiny after 2020 transcripts reveal Jerome Powell’s contentious rate guidance, compounded by a Justice Department investigation that has rattled financial markets and sparked debate over central bank independence. On the policy front, the EU’s ‘Made in Europe’ initiative signals a shift away from free-trade orthodoxy, while Trump’s economic agenda—including tariffs, housing market interventions, and a potential Fed leadership shakeup—dominates Wall Street’s calculus, with investors adopting a ‘don’t fight the White House’ strategy. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia’s aggressive tourism push under Vision 2030 and Novo Nordisk’s 8% stock surge on strong Wegovy sales highlight divergent bets on global growth drivers.
