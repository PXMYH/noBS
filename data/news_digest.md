Geopolitical and economic developments dominate this week’s headlines, with Japan’s financial markets reacting sharply to potential tax cuts ahead of an anticipated snap election. Reports of a possible reduction in food taxes trigger a surge in food-related stocks while government bonds slump, signaling investor uncertainty. Meanwhile, tensions escalate in Latin America as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issues advisories warning pilots of heightened military activity near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, raising concerns over regional stability. In Venezuela, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial claim as 'acting president' of the country sparks debate over his push to exploit its oil reserves, though analysts suggest U.S. oil giants may hesitate due to domestic alternatives.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from President Trump’s latest trade threats, as his proposed tariffs on eight European allies over Greenland tensions spark a broad sell-off in equities and a surge in safe-haven assets. Gold and silver hit record highs, while the dollar weakens amid fears of escalating trade conflicts. The fallout extends to corporate earnings, with major U.S. banks reporting mixed results as Trump’s push to cap credit card interest rates looms over the financial sector. Meanwhile, China’s export-driven growth hits a 27-year high, though its real estate crisis continues to weigh on domestic savings. In other developments, Novo Nordisk shares rally on strong demand for its obesity drug Wegovy, while Coinbase flexes its political influence by blocking a Senate crypto bill. The Fed remains a focal point, with Chair Powell facing both a Justice Department investigation and Trump’s criticism, complicating the central bank’s independence.
