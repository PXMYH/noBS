## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Trump's keynote speech signals a further retreat from the liberal democratic order, ceding ground to China in global economic leadership. His meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy comes amid renewed threats to seize Greenland, while his administration's tariff threats against European wine and potential trade wars raise concerns over economic stability. Meanwhile, Venezuela remains a focal point as Trump expresses interest in U.S. investment despite lingering sanctions, while locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT to hedge against economic instability. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand the removal of ICE, citing constitutional violations, while the Pentagon faces criticism over attempts to control the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*. The week also sees lighter moments, such as a surge in demand for the sunglasses worn by French President Macron at Davos.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policy decisions rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, driven by Trump's abrupt tariff threats against Europe and subsequent reversal, which triggered rapid selloffs and rebounds. Safe-haven assets surged, with silver topping $100 an ounce for the first time and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high amid concerns over Greenland and currency instability. The yen also saw its biggest one-day jump since August on speculation of Japanese intervention, while the dollar suffered its worst week since May. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Capital One acquired fintech Brex for $5.15 billion, SpaceX lined up banks for a potential blockbuster IPO, and AMC entered debt restructuring talks, sending its bond prices tumbling. Private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a fund by 19% and warnings of a potential meltdown growing louder. The Fed's independence came under scrutiny as Trump's lawsuit against JPMorgan and pressure on the central bank raised concerns about political interference in monetary policy.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire, announcing its latest tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This event marks at least the sixth time in four years that LIV Golf has hosted a competition at a Trump-owned property, underscoring the league’s strategic partnership with the Trump brand. The collaboration highlights LIV Golf’s efforts to secure high-profile venues as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in professional golf, despite ongoing controversy surrounding its Saudi funding and the league’s disruptive impact on traditional golf tours. The tournament in New Jersey is expected to draw attention not only for its competitive field but also for the political and business implications of the league’s alignment with Trump’s properties. Meanwhile, the move reinforces LIV Golf’s aggressive expansion strategy, which includes securing lucrative deals and high-profile locations to attract top talent and sponsors.
