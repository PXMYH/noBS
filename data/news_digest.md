## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The raid, confirmed by President Donald Trump, marks a dramatic escalation in U.S. intervention in the region, with Trump stating that American companies will rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure and that the U.S. will 'run the country' until a transition is possible. While Venezuelan bonds surge on hopes of regime change, global oil markets remain largely unaffected, despite Venezuela’s vast reserves. The operation has also disrupted regional airspace, prompting flight cancellations in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions extend to Asia, where China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s visit to Taiwan and imposed a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. Saudi stocks also saw their sharpest drop in months amid rising global uncertainties.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets enter 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh the sustainability of last year’s tech-driven rally against mounting economic uncertainties. The Federal Reserve faces a fractured consensus on interest rates, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson signaling potential cuts later in the year, while minutes from the December meeting reveal deep divisions over inflation and unemployment risks. Meanwhile, the AI boom continues to fuel corporate borrowing and bond trading, though concerns persist about an overvalued tech sector and the broader impact of artificial intelligence on productivity and labor markets. In commodities, OPEC+ holds steady on oil output amid geopolitical turmoil, while silver prices whipsaw after China announces export restrictions, echoing its rare earths strategy. On the corporate front, Saks Global’s leadership shakeup and potential bankruptcy underscore retail sector strains, while SpaceX’s anticipated IPO looms as a blockbuster market event. Emerging markets show signs of resilience, with local investors propping up bonds, though Ethiopia’s debt restructuring deal highlights lingering sovereign risks.
