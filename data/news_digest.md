## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate this week's headlines, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in the punishment of 69 high-ranking officials, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares for a potential parliamentary dissolution, considering a temporary suspension of food sales tax—a move tied to her election campaign promises. In the U.S., the Trump administration makes bold policy shifts, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting influence over Venezuela's oil sector despite skepticism from major energy firms. Military tensions rise as the FAA issues warnings about increased activity near Latin American waters, advising pilots to avoid key Pacific Ocean routes near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, alleging ideological bias, while former President Donald Trump's financial maneuvers—including a $1 million investment in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds—raise eyebrows amid his involvement in corporate merger decisions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures as 2026 begins, with equities extending a fourth year of gains despite lingering uncertainties. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, as newly released 2020 transcripts reveal Chair Jerome Powell’s early missteps on rate guidance, while a Justice Department investigation into his tenure adds to tensions. President Trump’s threats to cap credit card rates at 10% and his public feud with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon over debanking have rattled financial institutions, though banks are pushing back against regulatory interference. Meanwhile, corporate earnings present a mixed picture: HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk beat expectations on strong loan growth and obesity drug sales, respectively, while major U.S. lenders like JPMorgan and Bank of America report weaker results amid political and economic headwinds. Overseas, Saudi Arabia’s aggressive tourism push under Vision 2030 and Germany’s industrial recovery are drawing investor attention, even as central banks globally stockpile gold amid dollar skepticism. The week also saw high-profile M&A drama, with Saks’ bankruptcy filing after its Neiman Marcus acquisition and Amazon’s $475 million stake in the deal turning worthless, while Netflix’s bold bid for Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets signals further consolidation in media.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape is buzzing with major developments, particularly in AI and semiconductor industries. OpenAI announces plans to introduce advertisements in ChatGPT for U.S. users, marking a new revenue stream for the AI giant. Meanwhile, President Trump imposes a 25% tariff on certain AI chips, including Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI325X, citing national security concerns, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the blow. The AI boom continues to drive demand for data center infrastructure, with Digital Realty's CEO dismissing concerns of oversupply as hyperscalers like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta expand their projects. In corporate news, Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries for the first time since 2018, while Uber doubles down on its expansion in Japan’s competitive taxi market. Regulatory and legal shifts are also notable, with the U.S. considering a greater role for private companies in cyberwarfare and the SEC approving new expiration rules for 'Magnificent Seven' stock options. Additionally, Taiwan secures a trade deal with the U.S., pledging more chip factories in America amid geopolitical tensions. The intersection of AI, trade policy, and corporate strategy dominates the week’s headlines, reflecting a rapidly evolving global economy.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures drive more households to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further challenging traditional supermarkets.
