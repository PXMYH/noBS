## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. The Trump administration escalates its aggressive stance on Venezuela, with former advisor Amos Hochstein cautioning against simplistic regime-change strategies, while analysts warn that Trump’s push to seize Venezuelan oil could backfire, weakening U.S. economic stability. Meanwhile, the State Department suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a move likely to strain international relations further. In Asia, Japan faces financial strain as municipal bond yields soar to decades-high levels following the Bank of Japan’s rate hike and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s snap election plans, signaling potential economic turbulence. On the diplomatic front, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S.-China tensions persist. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and tightening Defense Department control, reflecting broader political polarization.

## 💻 Technology

Tech and geopolitics dominate headlines as Taiwan strikes a trade deal with the U.S., lowering tariffs while pledging to expand chip manufacturing in America—a move that aligns with President Trump’s push to bolster domestic semiconductor production. Meanwhile, Trump imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X, citing national security concerns, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the blow. In Iran, activists leverage Starlink’s satellite internet to bypass government blackouts, highlighting the growing role of private tech in circumventing state censorship. On the corporate front, Boeing outperforms Airbus in deliveries for the first time since 2018, signaling a potential turnaround, while JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon dismisses speculation about leading the Federal Reserve but leaves the door open for a Treasury role. The AI sector faces volatility as U.S. stocks dip amid competition from China’s DeepSeek, though analysts downplay long-term threats to Nvidia’s dominance. Regulatory and labor tensions simmer, with union leaders accusing the Trump administration of echoing divisive rhetoric, and the U.S. weighing expanded private-sector involvement in cyberwarfare, raising legal and ethical questions.
