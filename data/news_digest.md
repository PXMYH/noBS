## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious amid political uncertainty, and Trump’s $100 billion investment plan faces skepticism. Meanwhile, Guyana stands to benefit from Maduro’s fall, reducing border tensions over its oil-rich territory. Elsewhere, China watches US actions in Latin America closely, having established itself as the region’s dominant economic partner. In other developments, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, while the UK faces diplomatic strain with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit threatened trade talks. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh mixed economic signals. U.S. inflation shows signs of stabilizing, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s measured approach to rate cuts, though labor market strength remains a key watchpoint. Meanwhile, geopolitical risks and policy shifts dominate headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector sparking both skepticism from energy giants like Exxon and a speculative rally in Venezuelan bonds. Corporate earnings reveal strain in sectors like autos—General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as EV demand falters—while defense stocks surge amid global tensions. Mergers and restructuring also take center stage, as Rio Tinto and Glencore revive talks for a $260 billion mining mega-deal, and JPMorgan replaces Goldman Sachs as the issuer of the Apple Card. Commodities remain volatile, with gold investors staying bullish after 2025’s record rally, though analysts warn of limited upside ahead.

Asia's tech stocks surge in 2026, with investors betting on the region's AI momentum, though Chinese AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. despite a $1 billion IPO week. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, faces backlash for generating sexualized images, prompting restrictions on image requests. In corporate moves, Walmart joins the Nasdaq 100, replacing AstraZeneca, while GM and Ford announce major EV-related writedowns amid a slowing electric vehicle market. Regulatory scrutiny intensifies as China investigates Meta's acquisition of AI startup Manus, and JPMorgan drops controversial proxy advisors in favor of AI-driven analysis for shareholder votes. The U.S. labor market shows signs of weakness, with job growth in 2025 hitting a five-year low, while Trump's policies on tariffs, housing, and Venezuela's oil industry draw mixed reactions from businesses and economists.
