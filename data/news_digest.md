## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The raid, authorized by President Trump, has led to Maduro's detention in New York, with the U.S. declaring it will temporarily govern Venezuela until a transition can be arranged. The move has sparked financial reactions, with Venezuelan bonds surging on hopes of regime change, while Saudi stocks dropped amid broader geopolitical tensions. The oil market, however, remains largely unaffected, as analysts suggest global supplies can absorb any disruptions from Venezuela. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed airspace over the Caribbean, citing safety risks, and airlines have canceled flights in response. In other news, China has escalated diplomatic tensions with the UK and Japan, threatening to cancel trade talks over a UK minister's Taiwan visit and imposing a ban on Japanese scallops as punishment for Japan's stance on Taiwan. Domestically, the U.S. government continues to grapple with the aftermath of Trump's federal workforce reductions, raising concerns about efficiency and reliability.

Meanwhile, OPEC+ holds steady on oil output despite market surpluses, while China’s move to restrict silver exports echoes its rare earths strategy, sending silver futures tumbling after a record high.

Meanwhile, France’s plan to ban food imports with EU-prohibited pesticides underscores growing global trade tensions, and corporate trends like Uber’s handling of sexual misconduct complaints and Planet Fitness’s push to attract Gen Z highlight evolving workplace and consumer dynamics. Cultural moments, from Warren Buffett’s unmatched investment legacy to the passing of influential figures in 2025, add depth to the year’s narrative, while quirky workplace trends—like startups adopting 'no shoes' policies—reflect shifting office norms.
