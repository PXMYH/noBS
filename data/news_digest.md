## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing mixed signals as investors navigate shifting economic policies and corporate developments. In the U.S., major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup report strong earnings, buoyed by robust trading revenue and net interest income, while Goldman Sachs prepares to release its fourth-quarter results amid heightened market volatility driven by Trump administration policies. However, retail giant Saks Global files for bankruptcy, highlighting ongoing struggles in the luxury sector, while food prices continue to climb, adding pressure on consumers. Meanwhile, China tightens margin financing rules to curb tech stock froth, even as its trade surplus hits a record $1.19 trillion, fueled by weak currency policies and export growth. Commodities see turbulence, with oil tanker rates spiking due to U.S. intervention in Venezuela, while silver prices retreat after Trump delays critical mineral tariffs. The Federal Reserve faces uncertainty as inflation holds steady at 2.7%, and political tensions rise over Trump’s proposed credit card rate cap, which banks vow to fight. Internationally, Zambia’s stock market surges on copper prices, and Mozambique seeks IMF support before debt renegotiations, reflecting divergent economic trajectories across emerging markets.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf's ambitious $5 billion challenge to the PGA Tour appears to be faltering, as the Saudi-backed league struggles to sustain momentum more than three years after its high-profile launch. Despite record-breaking prize money and bold promises, the circuit has failed to draw the anticipated crowds or disrupt the dominance of traditional golf tours. Meanwhile, in the business world, discount grocer Aldi announces aggressive expansion plans, aiming to open over 180 new U.S. stores in 2026. The move underscores shifting consumer priorities, as inflation and economic uncertainty drive shoppers toward value-focused retailers. While LIV Golf grapples with its future, Aldi's growth highlights broader trends in retail and sports economics, where financial pragmatism increasingly shapes industry landscapes.
