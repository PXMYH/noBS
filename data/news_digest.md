## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines as the U.S. navigates domestic and international challenges. President Trump's aggressive trade policies and potential tariff restrictions face legal scrutiny, while his administration's push to secure Venezuela's oil resources raises questions about feasibility and corporate interest. Meanwhile, concerns over China's potential military action against Taiwan intensify amid broader instability in international norms, highlighted by recent U.S. military activity in Venezuela and Greenland. Domestically, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, but economic protests in Minnesota underscore growing unrest over immigration enforcement. In Latin America, the FAA warns of heightened military activity near key ocean routes, while Venezuela's economic collapse drives locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from heightened volatility as geopolitical tensions and bond market turbulence dominate headlines. A selloff in Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and U.S. Treasuries has sent shockwaves through debt markets, prompting warnings from BlackRock and Brandywine Global about lingering risks. The crisis deepened after Japan’s Finance Minister called for calm, though yields remain elevated, pressuring bank stocks and forcing some borrowers, like a Chinese oil firm, to delay bond issuances. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks suffered their worst day since October after President Trump threatened new tariffs over Greenland, escalating trade conflicts with Europe and sparking fears of a broader economic fallout. Gold and silver have surged as safe-haven demand rises, with silver supplies tightening amid a retail buying frenzy. Corporate moves are also making waves, with Netflix sweetening its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery to fend off Paramount, while Novo Nordisk shares jumped 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug. Central banks, including Serbia’s, are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against dollar instability, reflecting broader concerns about currency credibility.

The tech and business landscape is buzzing with major developments this week. Netflix revamps its $83 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, opting for an all-cash deal to outmaneuver Paramount, signaling a potential shakeup in the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, AI continues to dominate headlines, with OpenAI introducing ads in ChatGPT for U.S. users as it seeks new revenue streams, while smaller AI-focused firms challenge Big Tech by capitalizing on infrastructure demands like data centers and grid capacity. Regulatory and economic shifts are also in focus, as China’s tech sector rallies amid Beijing’s push for self-reliance, despite global market pullbacks, and the IMF upgrades its 2026 global growth forecast to 3.3%, citing AI investment as a key driver. Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions and trade policies take center stage, with Trump imposing new tariffs on European countries and semiconductors, while Davos debates the future of AI, global economics, and leadership transitions at the World Economic Forum.
