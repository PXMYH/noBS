## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Ukraine faces a massive Russian drone and missile attack, even as US, Russian, and Ukrainian officials continue negotiations in the UAE to seek a resolution to the prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, President Trump's aggressive economic policies take center stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he renounces liberal democratic principles, sparking concerns over US leadership in the global economy. His threats of new tariffs on European wine and renewed trade wars add to the uncertainty, while his push for US investment in Venezuela clashes with existing sanctions, leaving businesses in limbo. Domestically, tens of thousands of Minnesotans stage a strike to protest ICE operations, demanding the agency's removal from the state. Elsewhere, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT for financial security, highlighting the broader impact of political and economic volatility on everyday citizens.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, with silver surging past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high as traders sought safe havens amid turmoil. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, while the yen strengthened on speculation Japan may intervene in currency markets, potentially with U.S. support. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One acquiring fintech Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX lining up Wall Street banks for a potential blockbuster IPO. The Fed’s independence came under scrutiny as President Trump’s lawsuit against JPMorgan and pressure on the central bank raised concerns about political interference in monetary policy. Private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19%, while emerging markets and commodities benefited from a 'quiet-quitting' of U.S. assets.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire. The league announces it will host a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort, marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in the past four years. This partnership underscores LIV Golf’s strategy of aligning with high-profile venues and figures, despite ongoing political and ethical debates surrounding its Saudi funding. The move also highlights the league’s efforts to solidify its presence in the U.S. golf market, even as traditional tours like the PGA maintain their dominance. Meanwhile, the collaboration raises questions about the intersection of sports, politics, and business, as LIV Golf’s expansion remains a polarizing topic in the golf world.
