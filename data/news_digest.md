## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. Canada seeks to repair strained relations with China, sending former central bank governor Mark Carney to Beijing amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Meanwhile, Japan faces financial instability as weak demand for its five-year bonds signals investor concern over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s potential snap election and rising debt. In Venezuela, the U.S. ramps up pressure by seizing oil tankers linked to illicit trade, prompting a shadow fleet of vessels to seek Russian protection. The move comes as President Trump pushes a controversial $100 billion plan to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves, though industry leaders remain skeptical. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war, while China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface over a minister’s Taiwan visit, threatening trade talks.
