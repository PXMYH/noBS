## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week, with President Trump's aggressive trade policies and diplomatic retreats reshaping international relations. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's keynote speech signals a further withdrawal from the liberal democratic order, ceding economic leadership to China amid warnings that his policies could weaken the U.S. long-term. Meanwhile, his threats of a new trade war persist, even as courts consider curbing his tariff authority. Oil markets react to swelling U.S. inventories and tentative progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks, with prices dropping 2.1% to near $59 a barrel. Elsewhere, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency, particularly USDT, as a hedge against government volatility. The contrast between Trump's isolationist stance and China's rising influence underscores a pivotal moment in global power dynamics.
