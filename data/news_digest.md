## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures dominate global headlines this week, with Russia facing logistical challenges as at least 12 tankers carrying Urals crude idle off the Omani coast, signaling potential disruptions in its oil exports. Meanwhile, oil prices surge above $65 a barrel amid escalating US pressure on Iran and attacks on Black Sea tankers, exacerbating supply concerns. In Latin America, President Trump's push to expand US influence in Venezuela's oil sector meets resistance from industry executives, while China watches closely, having already established itself as the region's dominant economic partner. Ukraine's corporate sector grapples with a $3 billion debt crisis as Russian strikes intensify, forcing businesses to seek debt extensions, though some, like vodka maker Nemiroff, continue expanding exports despite wartime challenges. Diplomatic strains also emerge as China threatens to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit, underscoring Beijing's sensitivity to territorial issues.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are navigating a mix of corporate resilience and political turbulence, with central bank independence emerging as a flashpoint. The Federal Reserve faces unprecedented pressure as a Justice Department criminal investigation into Chair Jerome Powell draws sharp rebukes from global central bankers, including the ECB and Bank of England, who issued a rare joint statement defending the Fed’s autonomy. The probe, which Powell dismisses as politically motivated, coincides with a cautious Fed stance on rate cuts, keeping borrowing costs steady amid lingering inflation concerns. Meanwhile, corporate earnings season kicks off with JPMorgan delivering mixed results—beating profit estimates but reporting a surprise drop in investment-banking fees—while Delta Airlines signals strong demand in high-end travel, hinting at another record year. In commodities, gold hovers near record highs as traders weigh geopolitical risks, while Europe’s energy hedge funds eye new opportunities from expanded trading hours. Elsewhere, Trump’s aggressive trade policies, including a threatened 25% tariff on nations dealing with Iran and a proposed 10% cap on credit card rates, rattle markets, with Capital One shares tumbling on the latter. M&A activity simmers as Glencore explores a merger with Rio Tinto, and Paramount escalates its opposition to Warner Bros.’ Netflix deal with board nominations and a lawsuit. Against this backdrop, hedge funds post their best gains in 16 years, capitalizing on market volatility, while China’s economic recovery remains uneven, with AI and robotics failing to offset a prolonged real estate slump.
