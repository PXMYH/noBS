## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian energy infrastructure by striking oil drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea, signaling a broader strategy to cripple Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making aggressive moves in Latin America, as President Trump pushes to secure Venezuela’s oil reserves—despite skepticism from major oil executives and concerns over political instability. The administration hints at lifting sanctions to facilitate oil sales, while trading giants like Vitol and Trafigura explore potential deals with U.S. refiners. However, Trump’s ambitions face resistance, with Greenland’s labor leaders rejecting his annexation claims and Democratic lawmakers calling for investigations into his Middle East envoy. Elsewhere, China’s shadow looms large, as Beijing threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, underscoring its growing assertiveness in global diplomacy. The week also highlights the resilience of Ukrainian businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, which continues expanding exports despite wartime disruptions.
