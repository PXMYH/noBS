## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Southeast Asia, Thailand's military frames its border clashes with Cambodia as part of a broader crackdown on cross-border scam operations, which have defrauded billions worldwide. Meanwhile, President Trump escalates rhetoric against Iran, urging protesters to continue demonstrations against the Khamenei regime while hinting at potential U.S. intervention, though analysts warn that direct U.S. involvement could backfire. On the economic front, Trump's push to revive Venezuela's oil sector faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives, with critics arguing the move could undermine domestic fracking industries already struggling with low prices. Elsewhere, Canada seeks to repair strained relations with China, sending former central bank governor Mark Carney to Beijing amid worsening U.S.-China ties. In Europe, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, while the UK grapples with diplomatic fallout after China threatened to cancel trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit.

Gold, silver, and copper surged as investors bet on looser monetary policy, while oil prices dipped after a strong rally, reflecting geopolitical uncertainties tied to Iran. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces unprecedented pressure as a DOJ investigation into Chair Jerome Powell sparks concerns over central bank independence, drawing rare public support from global counterparts. Corporate struggles are also in focus, with Saks filing for bankruptcy under heavy debt, while JPMorgan and Delta report strong earnings, signaling resilience in key sectors.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. grocery market, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discount retailers. The German-based chain's aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, where discounters are gaining ground by attracting shoppers across income levels with lower prices and streamlined offerings. This move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push more consumers to prioritize value without sacrificing quality. Aldi's strategy also highlights the shifting dynamics in retail, where traditional supermarkets face mounting pressure to adapt or risk losing market share to more agile, cost-effective competitors.
