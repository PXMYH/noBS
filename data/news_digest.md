## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals in early 2026, with U.S. stocks lagging behind international peers despite a strong 2025 driven by AI optimism. Investors are diversifying away from U.S. assets, while defense stocks in Europe and Asia surge amid geopolitical tensions. Gold remains a favored safe haven after its record 2025 rally, though expectations for a repeat performance are tempered. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts, awaiting clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as December’s jobs data suggests a cooling labor market. Corporate earnings reveal struggles in the auto and EV sectors, with General Motors posting a $7.1 billion loss due to scaled-back electric vehicle ambitions, while Volkswagen faces tariff-related sales declines. Mergers and acquisitions are heating up, particularly in mining, where Rio Tinto and Glencore restart talks for a potential $260 billion merger. Venezuela’s oil sector is in focus as President Trump pushes to leverage its reserves to lower U.S. oil prices, though energy executives remain skeptical. In real estate, institutional homebuyers face scrutiny, and commercial markets adapt to shifting migration patterns. The Fed’s independence is under pressure as political influences grow, while India’s robust 7.4% growth rate sparks debate over its sustainability.
