## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a trade deal with China, signaling a potential new trade war. Meanwhile, Trump's aggressive stance on Venezuela—vowing to seize its oil—highlights his administration's confrontational approach to foreign policy, though sanctions continue to complicate U.S. investment in the country. In Europe, France faces criticism from its central bank over insufficient deficit reduction, while protests in Minnesota against ICE operations underscore domestic unrest. At Davos, discussions on Ukraine's future and global economic leadership reveal shifting power dynamics, with China gaining influence as the U.S. retreats from traditional alliances. The week also saw Venezuela's economic instability driving locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against government volatility.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets experienced significant volatility this week as President Trump's unpredictable policy shifts rattled investors. The S&P 500 posted its first two-week loss since June, while the dollar suffered its worst week since May amid fears of a U.S. 'policy nightmare.' Trump's abrupt reversal on European tariffs initially sparked a market rally, but his ongoing pressure on the Federal Reserve and lawsuit against JPMorgan added to uncertainty. Meanwhile, Japan's bond market faced sudden chaos, prompting speculation of currency intervention, while gold and emerging markets saw increased interest as investors diversified away from U.S. assets. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's reported preparations for a potential $800 billion IPO. However, concerns grew over private credit risks, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19%, and AMC's bondholder talks raising fears of broader debt restructuring. The week also saw mixed corporate earnings, with Procter & Gamble beating estimates but reporting weaker revenue, and Lowe's pivoting to attract younger consumers as housing market sluggishness persists.
