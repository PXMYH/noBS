## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate headlines as President Trump escalates threats of a new trade war, even as courts weigh limiting his tariff authority. His first year in office leaves economists warning of long-term economic weakening, while his controversial stance on Venezuela—where he has declared himself 'acting president'—faces skepticism from major oil companies wary of the risks. Meanwhile, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, offering temporary stability amid political divisions. In Minnesota, unions and faith groups plan an economic blackout to protest increased ICE activity following a high-profile killing, highlighting domestic unrest. Internationally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity over Latin American waters, urging caution for flights near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama. The crisis in Venezuela also drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against economic collapse, underscoring the broader impact of political instability on global markets.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling as geopolitical tensions and economic policy shifts dominate headlines. U.S. and European stocks plummeted Tuesday after President Trump threatened new tariffs on European allies, including a 10% cap on credit card interest rates, while escalating his push for control over Greenland. The S&P 500 erased its 2026 gains, and Treasury yields surged amid a broader selloff in bonds, including a record rout in Japanese government debt that sent yields to decades-high levels. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces uncertainty as Trump weighs replacing Chair Jerome Powell, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinting a decision could come next week. Corporate maneuvering is also in focus, as Netflix sweetens its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery to fend off rival Paramount, while Novo Nordisk shares jumped 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug. Against this backdrop, central banks are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge, with gold prices hitting all-time highs amid concerns over the dollar’s stability and rising capital wars.
