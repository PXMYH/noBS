## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is making bold moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where President Trump is pushing for U.S. control over the country’s oil reserves following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Major oil companies remain hesitant to invest due to political and financial risks, though commodities traders like Vitol and Trafigura are exploring opportunities with U.S. refiners. The shift in Venezuela’s leadership has also eased tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from its own oil wealth. Meanwhile, China, a dominant economic player in the region, is closely monitoring U.S. actions as it seeks to maintain its influence. Elsewhere, Greenland’s leadership has firmly rejected Trump’s annexation proposals, while the U.S. faces diplomatic scrutiny over its Middle East envoy. In Europe, the UK’s relations with China remain strained after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit. Despite ongoing conflicts, Ukrainian businesses like Nemiroff continue to adapt, expanding exports amid wartime challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets in early 2026 are shaped by geopolitical shifts, central bank caution, and sector-specific trends. The U.S. stock market, while still buoyed by AI optimism, is underperforming relative to international peers as investors diversify away from the dollar. Defense stocks are surging amid global instability, while gold remains a favored safe haven despite its record 2025 rally. The Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts, awaiting clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as Egypt and India signal potential easing. Corporate developments are dominated by high-stakes M&A, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining firm, while General Motors scales back its EV ambitions after a $7.1 billion loss. President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector—promising billions in U.S. investment—faces skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which call the country ‘uninvestable’ without major reforms. Meanwhile, financial policy moves, such as Trump’s proposed 10% credit card interest rate cap and a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase order for Fannie and Freddie, are sparking industry backlash and concerns over market distortions.
