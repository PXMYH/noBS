## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is intensifying its focus on Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers—including a Russian-flagged vessel—and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the dramatic capture of Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. plans to lift some sanctions to facilitate Venezuela’s oil exports, a move that has disrupted global markets, causing Canadian crude prices to tumble and raising questions about China’s billions in loans to Caracas. Meanwhile, Mexico vows to continue oil shipments to Cuba as humanitarian aid, defying U.S. pressure. The geopolitical fallout extends beyond Latin America, with China debating lessons for Taiwan and threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s visit to Taipei. Domestically, Trump is cracking down on defense contractors over executive pay and stock buybacks, while the dissolution of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting marks a shift in media funding under his administration.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with geopolitical and economic shifts as the U.S. tightens control over Venezuela’s oil industry following the seizure of President Nicolás Maduro. The move has sparked volatility in energy markets, with crude prices declining amid expectations of increased Venezuelan supply, while Venezuela’s bonds surge on hopes of debt restructuring. Meanwhile, Treasury yields fall as weak U.S. employment data fuels bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts, though Fed officials like Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari signal caution on further easing. Corporate America faces mixed fortunes: Blackstone and housing stocks tumble after President Trump’s proposal to ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, while GameStop grants CEO Ryan Cohen performance-based options tied to a $100 billion valuation target. Elsewhere, Japan’s bond market braces for a supply shock, and Canada’s bank economists push for tax reforms to boost competitiveness. The Fed’s independence is under scrutiny as political pressures mount, while the U.S. secures an exemption from a global corporate tax deal, drawing criticism. In other news, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolves after federal funding cuts, and SpaceX’s anticipated IPO looms as a potential blockbuster event for 2026.
