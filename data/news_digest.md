The first week of 2026 brings a mix of economic shifts, political tensions, and cultural trends. On the economic front, U.S. labor market signals are mixed: while job-cut announcements hit a 17-month low and companies plan more hiring, a growing number of workers remain stuck in part-time roles or juggling multiple jobs to cover rising costs. The minimum wage rises in several states, with more Americans now earning at least $15 per hour than the federal minimum of $7.25, yet affordability concerns persist, particularly in housing and youth sports, where costs are soaring. Meanwhile, Europe’s banks close out a strong year, though questions loom about their 2026 outlook, and Norway’s Equinor secures a $10 billion deal to sustain oil and gas production. Politically, the Trump administration faces backlash over immigration policies, including a fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis and legal challenges to a $100,000 H-1B visa fee, while Congress races to avoid another government shutdown. In culture and business, GQ’s editor-in-chief departs for a role with Pharrell at Louis Vuitton, and travel loyalty programs ramp up exclusive perks to retain fickle customers.
