## 🌍 World & Politics

The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by the U.S. dominates global headlines, sparking geopolitical and economic ripple effects. China, a long-time ally of Caracas, faces uncertainty over billions in loans and oil deals, while debates in China reveal divisions over whether Maduro’s downfall offers lessons for Taiwan. The U.S. is tightening its grip on Venezuela’s oil sector, with investors like Michael Burry positioning for a potential revival, though the move has disrupted regional airspace and triggered flight cancellations. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Japan escalate as Beijing threatens to cut off rare earth supplies and bans Japanese scallops over Taiwan-related disputes. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, while global businesses, including a Ukrainian vodka maker, adapt to ongoing conflicts.

Global markets are showing mixed signals as 2026 begins, with a record-breaking stock rally losing momentum amid signs of overheating. European equities are drawing interest as U.S. investors diversify beyond tech-heavy markets, while Saudi Arabia’s stock market climbs after opening to all foreign investors—a move aimed at boosting capital inflows. China’s central bank continues its gold-buying streak, extending it to 14 months as prices surge, while iron ore hits multi-month highs on restocking and economic support hopes. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions flare as China imposes export curbs on rare earths and silver, tightening supply chains, and Venezuela’s political upheaval sparks volatility in oil markets and sovereign bonds. Corporate developments include Samsung’s $350 billion rally on record earnings expectations, Saks Global’s leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors, and the dissolution of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after federal funding cuts.
