Meanwhile, China's internal military purge, marked by the ousting of top general Zhang Youxia, signals a major shift in Beijing's leadership dynamics, raising questions about President Xi Jinping's consolidation of power. On the trade front, President Trump escalates economic threats, vowing a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China, while the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid rising protectionism. Diplomatic strains between China and Japan deepen as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo's stance on Taiwan, underscoring the fragility of regional relations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant shifts as geopolitical tensions and central bank policies drive volatility. Gold surged past $5,000 an ounce for the first time, fueled by safe-haven demand amid US President Donald Trump’s disruptive trade policies and currency interventions. The dollar weakened as traders speculated on potential US-Japan coordination to stabilize the yen, while emerging-market currencies, including the South Korean won, hit record highs. Meanwhile, China is opening its nickel and lithium futures markets to foreign investors, signaling its ambition to expand influence in global commodities. Corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One acquiring fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX preparing for a blockbuster IPO. However, concerns over private credit risks and Fed independence loom as Trump’s legal battles with JPMorgan and pressure on the Federal Reserve escalate.
