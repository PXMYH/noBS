## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as the U.S. intensifies its intervention in Venezuela, seizing oil tankers and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. The move, which includes lifting some sanctions to secure Venezuelan crude, has triggered geopolitical ripple effects, with China reassessing its oil deals with Caracas and debating the implications for Taiwan. Meanwhile, financial markets react to President Trump’s aggressive policy shifts, including a crackdown on defense contractors and housing market reforms, fueling volatility. In Europe, French farmers stage protests against an EU-South America trade deal, while Iran faces internal unrest as its president attempts to curb security forces’ crackdown on protesters. Elsewhere, businesses in Ukraine adapt to wartime challenges, and diplomatic strains persist between China and the UK over Taiwan.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh geopolitical risks and shifting economic policies. Wall Street strategists, including Goldman Sachs, predict a broader equity rally driven by resilient U.S. consumer spending, though concerns linger over the sustainability of the AI-driven market surge that dominated 2025. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions—particularly U.S. actions in Venezuela—are reshaping energy markets, with oil prices volatile amid uncertainty over Venezuela’s future crude sales and unresolved claims from firms like Exxon Mobil. In Europe, Italy’s strong bond sale highlights investor appetite for sovereign debt, while the UK’s retail sector faces headwinds after lackluster holiday sales at major chains like Tesco and AB Foods. Corporate shake-ups are also in focus, with JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs and Warren Buffett’s formal exit from Berkshire Hathaway marking a leadership transition. The Fed’s independence faces pressure as political and policy challenges mount, while the anticipated SpaceX IPO looms as a potential blockbuster event for markets.
