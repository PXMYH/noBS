## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures dominate global headlines this week. In Europe, the UK fines Bank of Scotland £160,000 for facilitating banking services for a sanctioned ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, highlighting ongoing enforcement challenges in Western sanctions against Moscow. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains escalate in Asia as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets by nearly half following Tokyo’s warning that a Taiwanese invasion could trigger Japanese military intervention—a statement that has deepened the rift between Beijing and Tokyo. Stateside, President Trump’s aggressive trade posture resurfaces as he threatens a new trade war, even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority, while his administration grapples with the complexities of easing sanctions on Venezuela to encourage U.S. investment despite lingering restrictions. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota, where tens of thousands demand the removal of ICE from the state, citing constitutional violations, in a striking display of civil disobedience. Against this backdrop, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals to adopt cryptocurrencies like USDT as a hedge against government volatility, underscoring the broader trend of digital assets filling gaps in faltering economies.

## 💻 Technology

Tech and AI dominate headlines this week, with SK Hynix shares surging on reports it’s the sole supplier of advanced memory for Microsoft’s new AI chip, underscoring the intensifying competition in semiconductor supply chains. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s planned visit to China highlights the company’s efforts to navigate slowing AI chip sales amid geopolitical tensions, as President Trump imposes limited tariffs on foreign semiconductors. Regulatory scrutiny also takes center stage, with the EU launching an investigation into X over AI-generated explicit content, while TikTok updates its U.S. terms following a corporate restructuring to distance itself from its Chinese parent company. Beyond tech, extreme winter weather disrupts air travel and strains power grids, prompting U.S. grid operators to prioritize household electricity over data centers—a move reflecting growing concerns about energy demand from AI and digital infrastructure. Economic uncertainty lingers, with the IMF upgrading global growth forecasts to 3.3% for 2026, buoyed by AI investment, though record debt levels in wealthy nations and volatile trade policies under Trump’s administration continue to cast shadows over long-term stability.
