## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures dominate global headlines this week. China is offering to ease restrictions on Canadian rapeseed imports in exchange for relaxed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles during Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit, signaling a potential thaw in trade relations. Meanwhile, Russia faces logistical challenges as at least 12 tankers carrying Urals crude idle off the Omani coast, exacerbating delivery delays amid broader energy market volatility. Oil prices briefly surged above $65 a barrel following U.S. pressure on Iran and attacks on Black Sea tankers, compounding concerns over global supply stability. In the Americas, President Trump's push to revive Venezuela's oil sector meets skepticism from U.S. energy executives, while his broader economic strategy—including threats to penalize underperforming defense contractors—draws criticism for its outdated approach. Ukraine's corporate sector grapples with a $3 billion debt crisis as Russian strikes intensify, though some businesses, like vodka exporter Nemiroff, continue expanding exports despite wartime disruptions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic resilience and political tensions, with the U.S. economy propping up global growth despite warnings of a weak decade ahead. Inflation data shows core CPI rising less than expected in December, reinforcing trader bets on Fed rate cuts by mid-year, though a top Fed official signals little urgency for immediate action. Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell has sparked unprecedented pushback from global central bankers, who rally in defense of the Fed's independence amid Trump administration pressure. Corporate earnings remain in focus, with JPMorgan beating estimates despite a surprise drop in investment-banking fees, while Delta forecasts record earnings on strong travel demand. In M&A, U.S. Bancorp acquires BTIG for $1 billion, and Paramount escalates its fight against Warner Bros. Discovery's Netflix deal. Commodities like gold steady near records as markets weigh geopolitical risks, while European defense stocks face valuation concerns after a 20% surge this year.

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push more households to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further challenging traditional supermarkets and rivals like Walmart and Kroger. The expansion could reshape the retail landscape, forcing competitors to adjust pricing and promotions to retain customers.
