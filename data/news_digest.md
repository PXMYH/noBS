## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week, with President Donald Trump's aggressive push into Venezuela's oil sector drawing mixed reactions. Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year adds to his domestic economic agenda, though its feasibility remains uncertain. Meanwhile, China's deepening influence in Latin America contrasts with Trump's efforts, as Beijing monitors U.S. moves closely. In Europe, Lufthansa delays flights to Iran amid escalating protests, while Bolivia's government prepares a new economic decree after mass unrest over fuel subsidies. Elsewhere, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war, and China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit, underscoring Beijing's assertive diplomatic stance.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are on edge as the Trump administration escalates its pressure on the Federal Reserve, with the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The move, widely condemned by former Fed officials and market analysts, raises concerns about central bank independence and risks driving interest rates higher, contrary to Trump’s stated goals. Stocks and bonds fluctuate amid the uncertainty, reviving the 'sell America' trade as investors weigh the potential fallout. Meanwhile, corporate maneuvering takes center stage, with Paramount Skydance intensifying its battle for Warner Bros. Discovery by nominating directors to block a merger with Netflix and filing a lawsuit for financial transparency. In other developments, Eli Lilly’s weight-loss pill advances toward U.S. approval, while emerging markets gain traction as the dollar weakens. The Golden State Warriors’ parent company also makes headlines with a reported $11 billion valuation ahead of a minority stake sale.
