## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from heightened volatility as geopolitical tensions over Greenland and a meltdown in Japanese government bonds rattle investors. The S&P 500 suffered its worst drop since October, while oil and equities slid amid fears of escalating trade conflicts under President Trump’s tariff threats. Japan’s bond turmoil, which saw yields surge to record highs, has prompted warnings of potential spillover into U.S. Treasuries, with Citigroup estimating up to $130 billion in Treasury selling. Meanwhile, safe-haven assets like gold and platinum hit record highs, and silver demand surged as retail investors scrambled for precious metals. In corporate news, Netflix sweetened its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros Discovery, aiming to block Paramount’s rival offer, while Novo Nordisk shares jumped 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug. China, defending its growth model at Davos, faces economic headwinds from a slumping real estate sector, though exports helped lift 2025 growth to 5%. The Federal Reserve remains in the spotlight as Trump weighs replacements for Chair Jerome Powell, whose future is clouded by a Justice Department inquiry and Supreme Court battles over Fed independence.
