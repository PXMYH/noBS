## 🌍 World & Politics

{
    "summary": "Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines this week, with major developments in trade, diplomacy, and domestic policy. China's cross-border euro settlements surge to their highest level since 2010, reflecting a strategic shift amid booming EU trade, while Japan intensifies warnings about yen volatility, citing a new US agreement that could justify currency intervention. Meanwhile, the Trump administration escalates its hardline immigration policies by indefinitely suspending visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The move draws criticism as part of a broader isolationist agenda, compounded by controversial plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* over allegations of 'woke' bias, signaling tighter government control over media.

On the diplomatic front, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, seeking alternative markets as US trade ties deteriorate. The Trump administration's aggressive push to exploit Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from energy giants, with analysts warning the move could undermine US economic stability rather than bolster it. The resignation of Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy marks a notable shift in Hollywood leadership, though it remains a secondary story amid the week's heavier geopolitical and economic developments.",

## 💻 Technology

This week’s tech and business landscape is dominated by geopolitical and economic shifts, with the Trump administration imposing a 25% tariff on AI chips from Nvidia and AMD, citing national security concerns, while simultaneously striking a trade deal with Taiwan to lower tariffs and boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. The move comes as European tech stocks outperform their U.S. counterparts, signaling a shift in global market dynamics. Meanwhile, AI developments take center stage, with China’s DeepSeek sparking a broad selloff in U.S. AI stocks, though analysts downplay long-term threats to giants like Nvidia. In corporate news, Boeing outperforms Airbus in deliveries for the first time since 2018, while JPMorgan reports lower profits amid regulatory pressures. Elsewhere, Starlink’s satellite internet becomes a lifeline for Iranian activists amid a government-imposed blackout, and the UK awards major wind farm contracts to power 12 million homes. The week also sees labor tensions, with unionization efforts at a New York bakery and criticism of the Trump administration’s labor rhetoric. Finally, the potential for mega IPOs in 2026 looms large, with SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic eyed as potential market movers.
