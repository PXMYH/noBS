## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as the U.S. captures Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise military operation, prompting sharp reactions from China, which condemns the move as a 'hegemonic act' and the end of 'Pax Americana.' The intervention disrupts Venezuela’s oil industry, casting doubt on foreign claims to billions of barrels and straining China’s energy supply—though Beijing’s stockpiled crude may mitigate short-term impacts. Meanwhile, geopolitical frictions extend to Asia, where China’s trade curbs on Japan over Taiwan tensions hurt duty-free sales, and Beijing’s long-term dominance in rare earths underscores its strategic leverage. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on amid wartime challenges, while domestic U.S. policies under Trump continue to reshape federal operations and Wall Street’s dealmaking landscape.
