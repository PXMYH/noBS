## 🌍 World & Politics

Global markets are adapting to geopolitical shocks, with investors focusing on AI growth and potential rate cuts despite President Trump's unorthodox military operations, including the recent ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. is now exerting greater control over Venezuela's oil industry, with plans to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude, a move that has caused oil prices to decline. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Japan are escalating, with Beijing threatening to cut off rare earth supplies, a critical vulnerability for Japanese manufacturers. In other developments, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has dissolved after losing federal funding, and businesses in Ukraine continue to operate and expand despite ongoing conflict. The geopolitical landscape is further complicated by China's warnings to the UK over Taiwan and its ongoing trade disputes with Japan, including a ban on Japanese scallops.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals as 2026 begins, with Saudi Arabia making bold moves to liberalize its stock and real estate markets to attract foreign investment, while geopolitical tensions—particularly between China and Japan—weigh on Asian equities. Commodities are seeing volatility, with iron ore hitting multi-month highs on Chinese restocking and policy hopes, while palm oil gains on export optimism. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s potential oil exports to the U.S. under Trump’s administration are sparking energy sector rallies, though experts remain skeptical about long-term commitments. On the corporate front, Wall Street banks like Citi and JPMorgan are skipping lucrative IPOs over fee disputes, and Saks Global’s leadership shakeup hints at financial distress. The Fed’s cautious stance on rate cuts and ongoing AI-driven market bifurcation add to the uncertain outlook, as investors balance optimism with risks like commercial real estate stabilization and global tax deal exemptions for the U.S.
