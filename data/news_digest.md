## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has sent shockwaves through global markets and geopolitics, with the Trump administration asserting control over Venezuela’s oil resources. The move has led to a surge in Venezuelan crude held at sea, intensified diplomatic tensions, and prompted China to reassess its oil deals with Caracas, as Beijing debates the implications for its own territorial claims, including Taiwan. Meanwhile, the U.S. has tightened its grip on Venezuelan oil sales, seizing tankers and restricting Caribbean airspace, while domestic political fallout includes calls for investigations into the Middle East envoy and a stalled trade deal with India over diplomatic missteps. Elsewhere, Ukrainian businesses continue to adapt amid ongoing conflict, with exporters like Nemiroff expanding despite wartime challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are on edge ahead of Friday’s U.S. payrolls report, which could shape the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path, while the dollar hits a one-month high amid rising Treasury yields. The Supreme Court’s impending ruling on President Trump’s tariffs adds to uncertainty, with stocks swinging as investors weigh geopolitical risks, including tensions with Iran and Venezuela. In corporate news, General Motors reports a $7.1 billion earnings loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, citing shifting federal policies and waning consumer demand. Meanwhile, MiniMax Group’s Hong Kong IPO surges 91% in its debut, raising $619 million, while Saks Global struggles to secure financing amid potential bankruptcy. Energy markets remain volatile, with oil prices rising on geopolitical tensions and Venezuela’s uncertain future, though experts doubt a rush of U.S. investment despite Trump’s claims. The Fed’s independence faces scrutiny as Trump’s policies reshape trade and economic ties, with the U.S. trade deficit hitting its lowest level since 2009 due to tariffs.
