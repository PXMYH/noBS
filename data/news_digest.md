## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly after President Trump's threats of new tariffs over Greenland, which triggered a broad selloff in stocks, bonds, and commodities. The S&P 500 dropped over 1% in early trading, while Japanese bond yields surged to record highs amid investor concerns over Prime Minister Takaichi’s tax-cut proposals. Gold prices soared past $4,700 an ounce as safe-haven demand spiked, and the dollar weakened further after a Danish pension fund announced plans to divest from U.S. Treasuries. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Netflix sweetening its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros Discovery to fend off rival offers, and Advent International preparing a €3 billion sale of Italian confectioner Irca SpA. Central banks and investors are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against volatility, with experts warning of potential 'capital wars' if trade disputes escalate into broader economic conflicts. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, leaders like UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti emphasized the impossibility of diversifying away from the U.S. economy, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted that Trump may announce his Fed chair pick as early as next week.
