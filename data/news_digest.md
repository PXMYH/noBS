The tech and business world is buzzing with major developments this week, led by OpenAI’s announcement that ChatGPT will begin displaying ads to US users, marking a significant shift in monetization for the AI giant. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange is pioneering 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs using blockchain, signaling a potential revolution in financial markets. In corporate news, Boeing outperformed Airbus in 2025 for the first time since 2018, delivering 600 jetliners, while BYD continues to dominate the EV market, with analysts highlighting its undervalued battery business. The IMF’s upgraded global growth forecast to 3.3% for 2026, driven in part by AI investment, contrasts with China’s deepening demographic crisis as its birthrate hits a historic low. At Davos, global leaders grapple with AI’s economic impact, geopolitical tensions, and energy demands from AI data centers, which are now driving up electricity costs and prompting regulatory scrutiny.
