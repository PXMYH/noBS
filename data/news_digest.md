## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates global headlines with its aggressive push to secure Venezuelan oil, announcing plans to claim up to 50 million barrels and seizing two tankers as part of an intensifying blockade. While Vitol explores U.S. refiner interest in Venezuelan crude, skepticism lingers over the feasibility of Trump’s long-term vision, especially as China’s oil deals with Caracas face uncertainty following Nicolás Maduro’s ouster. The geopolitical fallout extends beyond energy, with China debating lessons for Taiwan and airlines canceling flights after the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace amid military operations. Meanwhile, Italy reassures citizens that NATO defense spending hikes won’t cut social programs, and defense stocks surge on Trump’s proposed 50% Pentagon budget increase. In Ukraine, businesses like Nemiroff vodka press on despite wartime disruptions, underscoring resilience amid ongoing conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical and economic crosscurrents as 2026 begins. Investor sentiment is cautious ahead of Friday’s U.S. jobs report and a looming Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs, which could reshape trade flows and fiscal policy. The tariff decision has drawn over 1,000 companies seeking refunds, while the U.S. trade deficit has already shrunk to its lowest since 2009. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s political upheaval is sending ripples through energy markets, with oil prices volatile as the U.S. moves to control the country’s crude reserves—a strategy Trump claims could slash oil to $50 a barrel. While energy stocks rally on the news, broader markets waver, with tech dragging on indices even as defense shares surge on Trump’s military spending plans. In corporate news, New Fortress Energy seeks more time for debt restructuring, and JPMorgan takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking the latter’s retreat from consumer finance. The Fed’s independence faces pressure as Trump pushes to reshape the institution, while emerging-market currencies dip amid a stronger dollar and shifting global trade dynamics.
