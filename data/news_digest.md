## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, with the Trump administration asserting control over Venezuela’s oil resources and seizing tankers to enforce a blockade. The move has sent shockwaves through energy markets, with oil prices surging amid escalating protests in Iran and U.S. threats of repercussions. Meanwhile, China faces uncertainty over its billions in loans to Venezuela, sparking internal debates about political power and comparisons to Taiwan. In Ukraine, Russia’s missile strikes—including a symbolic attack on Lviv—signal a shift toward strategic coercion rather than outright destruction, while Ukrainian businesses like Nemiroff Vodka press on despite wartime disruptions. On the diplomatic front, tensions flare as Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit. The geopolitical fallout from Maduro’s capture is reshaping alliances, with oil companies wary of investing in Venezuela despite Trump’s push for U.S. dominance in the sector.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic data, geopolitical tensions, and corporate shifts as 2026 begins. Investors are closely watching Friday’s U.S. jobs report, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path, while bond traders brace for volatility amid potential Supreme Court rulings on Trump’s tariffs. The dollar and Treasury yields are rising as the resilient U.S. economy overshadows political uncertainty. In corporate news, General Motors reports a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, and Reliance Industries suffers a $15 billion market cap wipeout due to weak retail outlooks and geopolitical pressures. Meanwhile, emerging-market borrowers are capitalizing on narrowing spreads, and Venezuela’s oil sector is drawing intense speculation following Trump’s plans to leverage its crude reserves. M&A activity is also in focus, with Rio Tinto potentially retaining Glencore’s coal business in a merger, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs.
