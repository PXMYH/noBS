## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. In Asia, Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi considers suspending food sales tax ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution, while China intensifies its anti-corruption crackdown, punishing 69 senior officials last year. The Pentagon also makes waves by overhauling the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and seeking greater control. On the economic front, former U.S. President Donald Trump invests in entertainment bonds amid his administration's push to reshape energy policies, though oil giants remain hesitant about his Venezuelan oil ambitions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, corporate earnings, and central bank uncertainty as 2026 kicks off. Equity markets remain resilient, with strong performances in Europe—particularly Germany—and optimism around earnings season, though concerns linger over valuations. The Federal Reserve faces renewed scrutiny after transcripts revealed Chair Jerome Powell’s 2020 rate guidance decisions, while the Bank of Japan keeps investors guessing on potential rate hikes amid political pressures. Meanwhile, President Trump’s threats to cap credit card rates and sue JPMorgan over alleged debanking have rattled financial institutions, adding volatility to an already tense policy landscape. Corporate highlights include Novo Nordisk’s 8% stock surge on strong Wegovy sales, Stellantis’ turnaround push, and Goldman Sachs’ exploration of prediction markets. Trade frictions escalate as the EU halts a US deal over Trump’s tariff threats, and China’s rare-earth export declines stoke fears of supply chain disruptions. Central banks, including Hong Kong’s, are bolstering gold reserves amid dollar skepticism, reflecting broader economic unease.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with Aldi and other value-focused retailers drawing shoppers away from traditional supermarkets. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push consumers across income levels to prioritize affordability without sacrificing quality. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further intensifying pressure on established grocers to adapt. The expansion also signals confidence in the U.S. market, where discounters are gaining a larger share of the grocery spend.
