## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive trade policies and diplomatic stance taking center stage. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump’s keynote speech signaled a retreat from the liberal democratic order, raising concerns about U.S. global leadership and economic stability. Economists warn that his first-year policies, including threats of a new trade war, could weaken the U.S. economy long-term, even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority. Meanwhile, China stands to benefit from the power vacuum, further solidifying its influence in the global economy. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT, a Tether-issued stablecoin, as a hedge against government volatility, highlighting the broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in unstable regimes. On the domestic front, the Pentagon faces pushback over attempts to control *Stars and Stripes*, with lawmakers and the newspaper’s leadership advocating for its independence amid accusations of political bias.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a volatile week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattle investor confidence. The dollar is on track for its worst week since June, pressured by concerns over a 'policy nightmare' ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting, while the yen surges amid heightened market jitters. Stocks initially plunged on fears of a U.S.-Europe trade war over Greenland, but rebounded after President Trump abruptly reversed course on tariffs, sparking a 'Trump Always Chickens Out' rally. Meanwhile, the Fed's independence faces scrutiny as the Supreme Court weighs Trump's attempt to fire a Fed governor, adding to uncertainty over monetary policy. Corporate activity remains brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and defense stocks like CSG NV soaring in their trading debuts. Emerging markets and commodities like gold are benefiting from diversification flows as investors pivot away from U.S. assets, while India cancels soy oil imports due to a slumping rupee. The week also saw Trump sue JPMorgan for $5 billion over alleged political debanking, and Procter & Gamble report mixed earnings, reflecting sticky inflation and shrinking consumer demand.

## 💻 Technology

This week's headlines are dominated by major shifts in tech, finance, and geopolitics. Big Tech is accelerating its AI ambitions, with companies issuing a record $108.7 billion in bonds to fund AI development, though analysts warn of economic risks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the high stakes in AI chip sales amid regulatory tensions. Meanwhile, TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about potential app changes for its 200 million American users. In corporate moves, Netflix revamps its $83 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, opting for an all-cash deal to outmaneuver Paramount, while Berkshire Hathaway prepares to exit its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz, marking a rare misstep for Warren Buffett. Regulatory and legal battles also take center stage, as the U.S. Supreme Court appears skeptical of Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and the FCC cracks down on late-night TV shows hosting political candidates. Beyond tech, geopolitical strains between the U.S. and Europe weigh on economic outlooks, while Japan's restart of its largest nuclear plant revives debates over energy security post-Fukushima.
