## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Ukraine faces a massive Russian drone and missile attack, even as US, Russian, and Ukrainian officials continue negotiations in the UAE to seek a resolution to the prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, President Trump's aggressive economic policies take center stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he renounces liberal democratic principles, sparking concerns over US leadership in the global economy. His threats of new tariffs on European wine and renewed trade wars add to the uncertainty, while his push for US investment in Venezuela remains hampered by existing sanctions. Domestically, tens of thousands of Minnesotans stage a strike to protest ICE operations, demanding the agency's removal from the state. In other developments, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins as a hedge against volatility, highlighting the broader impact of political and economic turmoil on civilian populations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, with silver surging past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high as traders sought safe havens amid turmoil. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, while the yen strengthened on speculation Japan may intervene in currency markets, potentially with U.S. support. Meanwhile, President Trump’s abrupt reversal on European tariffs triggered sharp market swings, underscoring the 'Trump volatility' now defining Wall Street. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s reported $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO. However, concerns over private credit risks and a potential Fed policy shift added to the uncertainty, as BlackRock marked down a private debt fund by 19% and traders speculated about a Trump-appointed Fed chair.
