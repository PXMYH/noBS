## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, emphasizes that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding Ukraine negotiations, while also addressing President Trump’s controversial threats to seize Greenland and his meeting with Zelenskiy. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive trade policies—including renewed tariffs on European wine and threats of a broader trade war—spark concerns as courts weigh limiting his tariff authority. His push for U.S. investment in Venezuela clashes with lingering sanctions, leaving businesses cautious. Back in the U.S., mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand ICE’s removal from the state, citing constitutional violations. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins for financial security, highlighting the broader trend of cryptocurrency as a hedge against unstable regimes. The Pentagon’s attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* faces pushback from Congress, underscoring ongoing debates over media independence.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets experienced significant volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policy decisions rattled investors. President Trump's abrupt reversal on tariffs—first threatening 200% levies on European goods before backing down—sparked a synchronized selloff followed by a sharp rebound, with the S&P 500 posting its first two-week loss since June. Safe-haven assets surged, with silver topping $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high amid concerns over Greenland and U.S.-Europe trade friction. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, boosting the yen and emerging-market assets as traders speculated on potential Japanese currency intervention, possibly with U.S. support. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Capital One acquired fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion, SpaceX lined up Wall Street banks for a potential $800 billion IPO, and Spirit Airlines entered takeover talks with Castlelake. However, cracks in private credit markets emerged, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19% and warnings of a potential meltdown in the $3.4 trillion sector. The Fed faced fresh scrutiny as Trump’s lawsuit against JPMorgan and pressure on central bank independence added to policy uncertainty, while sticky inflation data and mixed corporate earnings—including Procter & Gamble’s weaker-than-expected revenue—kept investors on edge.
