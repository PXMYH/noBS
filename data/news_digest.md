## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical tensions escalate as President Trump's administration continues to reshape U.S. economic and foreign policy. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's keynote speech signals a further retreat from the liberal democratic order, reinforcing China's rising influence in the global economy. Meanwhile, Trump's push for U.S. investment in Venezuela faces hurdles due to persistent sanctions, even as locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies like Tether's USDT to shield themselves from economic instability. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota as activists demand an end to ICE operations, citing constitutional violations, while Congress and Pentagon officials clash over the independence of the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, accused of being 'woke.' On the diplomatic front, French President Macron draws unexpected attention at Davos—not for policy but for his sunglasses, a lighthearted moment amid broader economic anxieties.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank actions, and corporate maneuvering as 2026 begins. Safe-haven assets like gold and silver are surging, with silver topping $100 an ounce and hedge funds boosting bullish gold bets to a 16-week high amid anxieties over Greenland and broader instability. The yen posts its biggest one-day jump since August on speculation of Japanese intervention, while the dollar suffers its worst week since May as unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattles investors. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 logs a second week of losses, with volatility easing in Treasuries despite lingering concerns over fiscal deficits and inflation. Corporate activity is brisk, highlighted by Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a blockbuster IPO, while Trump’s $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon underscores rising tensions between the administration and Wall Street. Commodities are also in focus, with copper rallying above $13,000 a ton and oil prices climbing on winter storm disruptions and Iran-related supply risks.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire. The league announces it will host a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort, marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in the past four years. This partnership underscores LIV Golf’s strategy of aligning with high-profile venues and figures, despite ongoing political and ethical debates surrounding its Saudi funding. The move also highlights the league’s efforts to solidify its presence in the U.S. golf market, even as traditional tours like the PGA maintain their dominance. Meanwhile, the collaboration raises questions about the intersection of sports, politics, and business, as LIV Golf’s expansion remains a polarizing topic in the golf world.
