## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic policy shifts dominate this week's headlines. The Trump administration escalates its hardline stance on immigration, indefinitely suspending visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. Meanwhile, the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. In Asia, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi considers suspending food sales taxes as part of her election campaign, signaling potential economic policy changes ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution. China's anti-corruption drive continues unabated, with 69 senior officials punished last year, reinforcing President Xi Jinping's crackdown on graft. On the corporate front, Trump's personal investment in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds raises eyebrows amid his administration's scrutiny of their merger, while major oil companies remain hesitant about Trump's push to exploit Venezuelan oil reserves, preferring domestic sources instead.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are charging into a high-stakes earnings season with equities rallying across major indexes, though concerns linger over inflation and central bank independence. The Federal Reserve faces renewed scrutiny as newly released 2020 transcripts reveal Chair Jerome Powell’s early missteps on rate guidance, while a Justice Department investigation into his actions adds political pressure. Meanwhile, President Trump’s economic policies—including a proposed 10% cap on credit card rates and tariff rhetoric—are disrupting sectors from banking to retail, with Wall Street pushing back against regulatory threats. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs beat estimates, but Bank of America, Citi, and JPMorgan fell short amid uncertainty over consumer debt and Fed policy. Overseas, Saudi Arabia’s aggressive tourism push under Vision 2030 and Germany’s industrial rebound are drawing investor attention, while central banks globally stockpile gold as a hedge against dollar volatility.
