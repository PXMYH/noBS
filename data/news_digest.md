## 🌍 World & Politics

President Trump's economic policies continue to dominate headlines, with economists warning of long-term weakening effects on the U.S. economy despite little immediate change. His threats of a new trade war persist even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority, while Congress moves toward a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown by the Jan. 31 deadline. Meanwhile, domestic tensions rise as Minnesota prepares for an economic blackout protest against increased ICE activity following a high-profile killing. Internationally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity over Latin American waters, raising concerns about regional stability. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT amid economic turmoil, while Trump's push to exploit Venezuelan oil faces skepticism from major energy firms.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly the standoff between the U.S. and Europe over Greenland, which has driven gold and silver to near-record highs as investors seek safe-haven assets. The crisis, compounded by Trump’s threats of new tariffs, triggered Wall Street’s worst session since October, with the S&P 500 dropping over 2%. Meanwhile, Japan’s bond market turmoil and a surging yen risk premium have added to the volatility, prompting calls for calm from Tokyo officials. Against this backdrop, corporate maneuvering continues: Netflix sweetened its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming to outpace Paramount, while KKR nears a record $20 billion Americas buyout fund. In policy news, Trump’s potential Fed chair pick looms, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advising against Powell’s Supreme Court attendance amid a Justice Department probe into the central bank. India’s budget and Vietnam’s infrastructure growth also draw investor attention as emerging markets navigate shifting economic currents.
