## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week's headlines, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian energy infrastructure by striking oil drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea, aiming to cripple Moscow's war funding. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making bold moves in Latin America, as President Trump pushes to secure Venezuela's vast oil reserves, despite skepticism from major oil executives and concerns over political instability. The administration hints at lifting sanctions to facilitate oil sales, though Venezuela's state-owned oil company denies finalizing any deal. The shift in Caracas follows the ouster of Nicolás Maduro, easing border tensions with oil-rich Guyana and drawing scrutiny from China, which has long held economic influence in the region. Elsewhere, Greenland firmly rejects Trump's annexation proposals, while China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit, underscoring Beijing's assertive stance on sovereignty issues. Domestically, Trump seeks expanded powers to pressure defense contractors over delays, reflecting his broader push to assert control over critical industries.
