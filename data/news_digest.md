## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate headlines as President Donald Trump's administration faces both domestic and international challenges. On the economic front, Citadel’s Ken Griffin warns that Japan’s bond selloff serves as a stark reminder for the U.S. to address its fiscal instability, while economists caution that Trump’s first-year policies, though initially inconsequential, may weaken the economy long-term. Meanwhile, Trump’s threats of a new trade war loom as courts consider limiting his tariff authority, even as he claims progress on a Greenland deal with NATO, sparking a stock market rally. Domestically, Congress moves to avert a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, but social unrest grows in Minnesota, where unions and activists plan an economic blackout to protest increased ICE operations following a recent killing. Internationally, Ukraine marks a symbolic economic milestone with its first post-invasion bond issuance, while Venezuela’s turn to USDT stablecoins highlights the broader trend of citizens in unstable regimes seeking financial refuge in cryptocurrencies.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets experienced significant volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts dominated headlines. U.S. stocks rebounded after President Trump softened his stance on European tariffs, easing fears of a prolonged trade dispute, though earlier threats had triggered the worst market selloff since October. Energy stocks surged amid rising oil prices, fueled by geopolitical uncertainty, while gold's rally cooled following Trump's claim of a 'framework' deal with NATO over Greenland. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with the Supreme Court appearing likely to reject Trump's attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, underscoring concerns about central bank independence. In corporate news, JPMorgan solidified its position as the world's largest active ETF manager, while Netflix sweetened its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery with an all-cash offer. The Davos summit saw mixed sentiment, with business leaders wary of Trump's policies but optimistic about Asia's growth potential.
