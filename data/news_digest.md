## 🌍 World & Politics

Tensions escalate as President Donald Trump weighs military action against Iran following reports of deadly crackdowns, even as Tehran seeks diplomatic talks. Meanwhile, Trump's aggressive push to secure Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, with executives reluctant to invest amid political instability. The move is seen as part of a broader U.S. strategy to counter China's dominance in Latin America, where Beijing remains a key economic player. Elsewhere, Greenland's labor leader firmly rejects Trump's annexation claims, while Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing conflict, highlighting resilience amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with heightened uncertainty as the Trump administration escalates its conflict with the Federal Reserve, sparking a 'Sell America' sentiment that sent stocks, bonds, and the dollar lower while propelling gold to record highs. The Justice Department's criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell has raised concerns about central bank independence, overshadowing economic indicators like soft U.S. job growth and India's low inflation, which could pave the way for rate cuts. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with major deals like Rio Tinto and Glencore's $260 billion merger talks and JPMorgan Chase's acquisition of the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. In tech and finance, Standard Chartered's crypto expansion plans and BlackRock's bullish stance on AI stocks highlight shifting investment trends, while emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East, see record VC funding. However, challenges persist, as seen in General Motors' $7.1 billion EV-related loss and Volkswagen's struggling U.S. sales, underscoring the uneven impact of policy shifts and economic pressures.
