## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week, with US President Donald Trump's aggressive stance on Iran and Venezuela driving market volatility. Oil prices surge above $61 a barrel as Trump escalates rhetoric against Iran, prompting algorithmic traders to turn bullish on crude for the first time since September. Meanwhile, his push to lure US oil executives into investing in Venezuela faces skepticism, with critics warning it could exacerbate a global supply glut and undermine domestic shale producers already struggling with low prices. The move is seen as part of a broader, controversial strategy to secure foreign resources, drawing comparisons to historical economic exploitation. In other developments, Colombia raises $5 billion in bonds ahead of pivotal elections, signaling confidence in its economic stability amid regional uncertainty. Diplomatic strains also flare as China threatens to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister's visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing's sensitivity to issues of sovereignty. Meanwhile, Ukraine's resilience shines through as businesses, including a major vodka exporter, continue operations despite ongoing conflict, expanding exports to Western markets like the UK.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are grappling with mixed signals as inflation holds steady at 2.7% in December, reinforcing expectations of a Fed rate cut by mid-year despite a top Fed official signaling little urgency for immediate action. The Fed faces unprecedented political pressure, with the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into Chair Jerome Powell, prompting global central bankers to rally in his defense. Meanwhile, corporate earnings kick off with JPMorgan beating estimates but warning of a slowdown in deal activity, while U.S. Bancorp announces a $1 billion acquisition of BTIG to expand its investment banking footprint. Elsewhere, hedge funds post their best returns since 2009, and Bitpanda prepares for a Frankfurt IPO, signaling renewed investor appetite for risk. Economic resilience is evident in strong municipal bond performance and a booming home renovation sector, though recession fears linger amid warnings of a potential 20% Dow drop by year-end.
