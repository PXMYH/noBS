## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intensifies its focus on Venezuela following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration is pushing to revive Venezuela’s oil sector, but major Western oil companies remain hesitant due to financial and political risks. Meanwhile, China watches closely, having established itself as Latin America’s dominant economic partner, while debates in China over Maduro’s capture reveal divisions about Taiwan’s future. In Europe, Greenland’s leadership firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, emphasizing sovereignty, while Ukraine’s economic resilience is tested as businesses like Nemiroff Vodka expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks. Domestically, U.S. lawmakers scrutinize Trump’s Middle East envoy, and the president calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases amid housing market concerns.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with mixed signals as investors weighed economic data, geopolitical risks, and corporate developments. U.S. stocks pushed to fresh highs following a December jobs report that reinforced the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on rate cuts, with traders now pricing in almost no chance of a reduction this month. The Fed’s independence faces renewed scrutiny as the Trump administration seeks to reshape the institution, while the central bank monitors inflation and labor market trends. Meanwhile, oil markets remained volatile amid rising tensions in Iran and ongoing uncertainty over Venezuela’s debt restructuring and potential oil exports to the U.S. In corporate news, General Motors reported a $7.1 billion loss tied to its scaled-back electric vehicle ambitions, while Rio Tinto and Glencore restarted merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining company. The hedge fund Unifi joined the billion-dollar club, and Aktis Oncology surged 27% in its IPO debut, highlighting continued investor appetite for high-growth sectors despite broader economic caution.
