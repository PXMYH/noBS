## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious amid political uncertainty, and Trump’s $100 billion investment plan faces skepticism. The shift in Venezuela also eases tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from reduced border disputes. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipments to Cuba heighten US-Cuba tensions, underscoring the region’s complex geopolitical dynamics. Beyond Latin America, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and China warns the UK over Taiwan-related diplomatic tensions, signaling broader global friction. Domestically, Trump targets defense contractors for delays and seeks congressional action to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as inflation trends and central bank policies remain in focus. U.S. inflation shows signs of gradual easing, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s measured approach to rate cuts, though December’s jobs data suggests officials will wait for clearer signs of economic softening. Meanwhile, corporate bonds face pressure as more firms teeter on the edge of junk status, while BlackRock predicts a continued bull run for AI stocks and a potential surge in retail crypto adoption. Geopolitical risks and policy shifts dominate headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector drawing skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which call the country 'uninvestable' without major reforms. Defense stocks rally amid global instability, while gold investors remain bullish after a record 2025. In corporate news, General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions, and Rio Tinto and Glencore revive merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining company. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though Trump’s policies targeting institutional homebuyers and mortgage bond purchases aim to reshape affordability.

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by significant developments in AI, corporate strategy, and regulatory shifts. Asia's tech stocks surge as investors bet on the region's AI leadership, though Chinese AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. despite a $1 billion IPO week. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, faces backlash for generating sexualized images of real people, prompting restrictions on image requests. In corporate news, Walmart joins the Nasdaq 100, replacing AstraZeneca, while Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin reduce ties to California. The U.S. job market shows signs of slowing, with December adding only 50,000 jobs, capping the weakest year of growth since the pandemic. Additionally, the Trump administration pushes for oil investments in Venezuela, promising 'total safety' to energy executives, though skepticism remains high. The EV market also sees shifts, with Stellantis scrapping Jeep and Chrysler plug-in hybrids amid slowing demand, while Ford announces plans for eyes-off driving tech in a $30,000 EV by 2028.
