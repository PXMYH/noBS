## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, culminating in the capture of Nicolás Maduro, dominates global headlines, sparking debates over its implications for Taiwan and China’s potential response. Beijing, already engaged in a diplomatic standoff with Japan over Taiwan-related remarks, imposes export controls on military-linked goods to Tokyo, while internal Chinese discussions reveal divisions over whether Venezuela’s ouster could serve as a blueprint for Taiwan. The fallout extends to Venezuela’s oil industry, with China’s billions in loans now in limbo and investors like Michael Burry positioning for U.S. involvement in the country’s energy revival. Meanwhile, the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolves after federal funding cuts, underscoring President Trump’s broader efforts to reshape government institutions. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses press on amid war, and tensions persist between China and the UK over Taiwan, with Beijing threatening to cancel trade talks following a minister’s visit to Taipei.
