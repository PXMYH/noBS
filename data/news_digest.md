## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate headlines as U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive policies reshape geopolitical and trade dynamics. Trump's renewed focus on Venezuela's oil reserves—including a $100 billion investment push—faces skepticism from energy executives, while his rhetoric against Iran sends oil prices to a two-month high, raising fears of supply disruptions. Meanwhile, his immigration policies yield a historic net migration decline, marking the first negative balance in 50 years. In trade, China offers Canada relief on canola restrictions in exchange for eased EV tariffs during Prime Minister Mark Carney's visit, while earlier tensions with the UK over a minister's Taiwan trip reveal Beijing's sensitivity to diplomatic provocations. Colombia joins a wave of emerging markets rushing to issue bonds ahead of elections, reflecting broader economic uncertainty. Amid ongoing conflict, Ukrainian businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff demonstrate resilience, expanding exports despite wartime challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets and economic indicators open 2026 on a cautious note as inflation holds steady and central bank tensions escalate. U.S. inflation remains subdued at 2.7% in December, reinforcing trader bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts by mid-year, though a top Fed official signals little urgency for immediate action. Meanwhile, a Justice Department criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell sparks global concern, with central bankers worldwide rallying in support of Powell’s independence amid Trump administration pressure. Corporate earnings kick off with JPMorgan delivering mixed results—strong trading revenue but weaker investment-banking fees—while U.S. Bancorp announces a $1 billion acquisition of BTIG to expand its trading business. In commodities, Brent crude rises on Iran tensions, lifting bonds for African oil producers, while Nigeria plans a $352 million green bond sale. The home renovation sector continues its boom, driven by high housing costs and an aging population, while hedge funds post their best year since 2009 with 12.6% gains.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. grocery market, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discount retailers. The German-owned chain’s aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, where discounters are gaining ground by offering lower prices and attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, with consumers prioritizing value amid inflationary pressures, forcing traditional supermarkets to adapt or risk losing market share. Aldi’s expansion also highlights its strategy to capture a larger portion of weekly grocery spending, further intensifying the battle for customer loyalty in the retail space.
