## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. intervention in Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro was captured and flown to New York to face charges. The move has triggered a scramble among global energy traders, with Trafigura and others negotiating with Washington to resume Venezuelan oil purchases, while China faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Caracas. Markets initially react with caution but quickly rebound, signaling investor confidence in the transition. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Japan escalate as Beijing imposes military export controls and bans Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. Domestically, the U.S. sees further fallout from President Trump’s federal workforce cuts, with critics warning of reduced government efficiency, while the dissolution of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting marks a major shift in public media funding. Ukraine’s resilience is highlighted as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, even as Moscow’s oil revenues plummet, weakening its war chest.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism as investors awaited key economic data, including US jobs reports, to gauge the Federal Reserve’s next moves. The S&P 500 inched higher, buoyed by a 2.7% surge in energy stocks amid geopolitical tensions in Venezuela, where President Trump’s intervention has sparked both market speculation and policy debates. Meanwhile, the Fed faces internal divisions, with hawkish new voters potentially delaying rate cuts, though Governor Stephen Miran argued for over a percentage point in reductions this year. Commodities saw volatile trading, with copper hitting record highs and silver rallying on Chinese demand, while oil prices rose on geopolitical risks. Corporate developments included Reliance Industries’ sharp decline on retail sector concerns, Saks Global’s leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors, and JPMorgan’s launch of a new advisory group to share strategic insights with clients. Emerging markets also drew attention, with Saudi Arabia opening its stock market to foreign investors and Citigroup warning of currency devaluation risks in oil-dependent African economies.
