## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines, with the U.S. and China locked in a strategic struggle over Latin America. President Trump’s aggressive push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector—including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and seizures of tankers—faces skepticism from Western oil executives wary of political risks, while China watches closely as its long-standing influence in the region is challenged. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s financial strain deepens as Ukrainian Railways suspends bond payments amid Russia’s prolonged invasion, though some businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on with exports despite wartime disruptions. Elsewhere, diplomatic friction flares as China threatens to scuttle UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, and Greenland’s labor leaders reject Trump’s annexation claims, underscoring Arctic sovereignty concerns. Domestic U.S. politics also heat up, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump urging Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with fresh highs as US stocks rallied on a December jobs report that reinforced the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on rate cuts, with traders now pricing in almost no chance of a January reduction. The Fed’s independence faces renewed scrutiny as President Trump’s administration asserts greater control over financial markets, including a $200 billion directive for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgage bonds—a move aimed at boosting housing affordability but echoing pre-2008 risks. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks to create a $260 billion mining giant, while General Motors reported a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions simmered as Trump outlined plans to leverage Venezuela’s oil reserves to drive crude prices down to $50 a barrel, though investors largely shrugged off broader geopolitical risks. In other developments, US household wealth hit a record high amid the stock rally, while the trade deficit shrank to its lowest level since 2009 due to tariff policies—though retaliatory measures continued to squeeze sectors like American whiskey exporters.
