## 🌍 World & Politics

Global energy markets face turbulence as geopolitical tensions escalate. Oil prices surge to a one-month high amid protests in Iran, raising concerns over supply disruptions from OPEC’s fourth-largest producer. Meanwhile, President Trump’s push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector meets skepticism from U.S. energy executives, who remain wary of political instability and economic risks. The move could further strain U.S. shale producers already grappling with a supply glut and four-year-low prices. In Latin America, Trump’s aggressive resource-focused strategy clashes with China’s established economic dominance, as Beijing monitors Washington’s actions closely. Elsewhere, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, while China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface over a minister’s Taiwan visit, threatening trade talks. Despite ongoing conflicts, Ukrainian businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue expanding exports, demonstrating resilience amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are navigating heightened uncertainty as political pressure on the Federal Reserve intensifies. The Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, widely seen as retaliation for resisting interest rate cuts, has sparked backlash from former Fed officials and market participants, who warn of risks to central bank independence. Despite the turmoil, the S&P 500 hit a fresh record, though gold and silver surged to all-time highs as investors sought safe havens. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s major banks are preparing a bond issuance spree following strong earnings, while Capital One and other lenders face volatility amid Trump’s proposal to cap credit card rates at 10%, a move banks warn could devastate profitability. In corporate news, Medline’s shares rose after its $7.2 billion IPO, while Pfizer’s CEO signaled optimism about its weight-loss drug pipeline. Geopolitically, Europe and China took steps to ease EV trade tensions, and Indonesia raised $2.7 billion in a sovereign bond sale, reflecting robust emerging-market debt activity.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. grocery market, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discount retailers. The German-owned chain’s aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, where discounters are gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. Aldi’s strategy reflects broader economic trends, with inflation and cost-of-living pressures driving more consumers to prioritize value without sacrificing quality. The move also signals a shift in shopping habits, as discounters like Aldi capture a larger portion of weekly grocery spending, challenging traditional supermarkets. Industry analysts note that Aldi’s expansion could further disrupt the retail landscape, forcing competitors to adjust pricing and promotions to retain customers.
