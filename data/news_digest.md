## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. has taken decisive action in Venezuela, removing President Nicolás Maduro from power and seizing control of the country’s oil resources. Chevron is accelerating oil shipments as the Trump administration moves to assert dominance over Venezuela’s crude reserves, while the U.S. has also seized two tankers amid an intensifying blockade. The geopolitical fallout is significant, with China’s oil deals with Venezuela now in question and debates in Beijing over whether Maduro’s ouster could serve as a blueprint for Taiwan. Meanwhile, defense stocks are surging as global tensions rise, and airlines are canceling flights after the U.S. closed Caribbean airspace due to the military operation. Domestic political developments include Democratic lawmakers calling for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, while Trump pushes Congress to block Wall Street from buying single-family homes.
