## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with the Trump administration making bold moves on multiple fronts. The U.S. indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Trump's push to assert control over Venezuela's oil resources draws skepticism, as analysts argue domestic production remains a more viable option for U.S. energy needs. Japan escalates its currency defense, invoking a U.S. agreement to justify intervention against the yen's rapid decline, signaling deeper economic coordination between the allies. On the diplomatic front, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Domestically, the Pentagon faces criticism for overhauling the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, with plans to increase Defense Department control, raising concerns about political influence over media.

This week's tech and business landscape is dominated by geopolitical and economic shifts, with the Trump administration imposing a 25% tariff on Nvidia and AMD AI chips, citing national security concerns, while also finalizing a trade deal with Taiwan that lowers tariffs and secures commitments for more U.S. chip factories.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping.

The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push consumers across income levels to prioritize affordability without sacrificing quality.
