## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. and Europe face growing rifts, with German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil warning Europe against naivety in its strained relations with Washington. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves sparks controversy, as major oil executives resist investment due to political and economic risks. The move, seen as a bid to counter China’s deepening influence in Latin America, raises concerns about U.S. economic strategy and potential market disruptions. Elsewhere, China’s assertive diplomacy surfaces again, with reports revealing it threatened to cancel UK trade talks after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff defy wartime challenges, expanding exports despite ongoing conflict. Domestically, Trump’s executive actions target defense contractors for delays and propose housing market reforms to curb corporate homebuying.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are on edge as the Trump administration escalates its pressure on the Federal Reserve, with the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The probe, which Powell calls an attempt to force rate cuts, has sparked concerns over central bank independence, sending U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar lower while driving gold and silver to record highs. The political fallout is deepening, with former Fed Chair Janet Yellen warning of 'chilling' implications for monetary policy and Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowing to block Trump’s Fed nominees. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions are roiling oil markets, with Iranian inventories slumping amid protests and Kazakh exports hampered by port disruptions. In corporate news, General Motors reported a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions, while BitGo’s $201 million IPO filing marks the first major crypto listing of 2026. The 'sell America' trade has resurfaced amid fears of eroding Fed autonomy, with investors seeking safer assets.
