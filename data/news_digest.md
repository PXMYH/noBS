## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, French President Emmanuel Macron’s appearance—marked by his signature sunglasses—overshadowed discussions on escalating crises, while President Trump’s keynote speech signaled a retreat from liberal democratic leadership, ceding influence to China. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s progress in trilateral peace talks with the U.S. and Russia eases oil market fears, though economists warn Trump’s first-year policies may weaken the U.S. economy long-term. Domestically, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, while Minnesota braces for an economic blackout protesting ICE operations. In financial news, Warner Bros. shareholders overwhelmingly reject Paramount’s bid, favoring a Netflix merger, and Venezuela’s turn to USDT stablecoins highlights growing reliance on crypto amid political instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded on Thursday as President Donald Trump walked back threats of new tariffs on European nations and Greenland, easing geopolitical tensions that had sparked a selloff earlier in the week. The dollar weakened while riskier currencies gained, and stocks rose across the U.S., Europe, and Australia, with investors adopting a 'Trump Always Chickens Out' strategy. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's independence faced scrutiny as the Supreme Court weighed whether Trump could fire a Fed governor, reinforcing concerns about political pressure on monetary policy. Economic data showed resilience in U.S. consumer spending and employment, dampening expectations for near-term rate cuts, while Treasury yields ticked higher. In corporate news, BitGo surged 25% in its IPO debut, raising $212.8 million, and Spirit Airlines entered takeover talks with Castlelake amid bankruptcy. Procter & Gamble reported mixed earnings, beating profit estimates but missing revenue targets, while Lundin Mining shares tumbled after slashing gold and copper production guidance. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s new leader courted oil investors with tax cuts and deregulation, and BlackRock’s emerging-market ETF saw record inflows as investors rotated out of U.S. assets.
