## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as China escalates its feud with Japan, imposing export controls on military-related goods in retaliation for Tokyo’s remarks on Taiwan. The move deepens regional strains, with Beijing also leveraging trade threats against the UK over a minister’s Taiwan visit. Meanwhile, the U.S. makes bold moves in Venezuela, where President Trump’s administration secures a deal for up to 50 million barrels of oil following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The intervention sparks debates over Venezuela’s oil revival and its broader geopolitical implications, particularly for China, which holds significant debt from Caracas. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, while airlines cancel flights amid Caribbean airspace closures tied to the Venezuela operation. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on despite wartime disruptions, highlighting resilience amid ongoing conflict.
