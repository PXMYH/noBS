## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend dominates global headlines, triggering widespread geopolitical and economic repercussions. The move, led by President Donald Trump, has sparked debates over its implications for Taiwan, with analysts questioning whether Beijing might consider similar action—though China faces far higher economic and political risks. Meanwhile, businesses and governments scramble to assess the fallout: Trafigura seeks clarity on Venezuelan oil investments, while China grapples with the fate of billions in loans to Caracas. The ouster has also disrupted regional stability, prompting the U.S. to close Caribbean airspace and airlines to cancel flights. Domestically, Trump’s aggressive foreign policy aligns with his broader efforts to reshape the federal government, which critics argue has left agencies less efficient. Elsewhere, tensions between China and Japan escalate after Beijing imposes military export controls in response to Tokyo’s Taiwan remarks, while UK-China relations remain strained following a British minister’s visit to Taipei. Amid these shifts, Ukraine’s resilience stands out, with businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expanding exports despite ongoing war challenges.
