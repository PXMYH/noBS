## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with aggressive moves in Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers—including a Russian-flagged vessel—and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The White House claims Venezuela will continue supplying oil to the U.S. indefinitely, easing some sanctions while tightening its grip on the nation’s energy sector. The intervention sparks mixed reactions among Trump’s allies, with some conservative media figures backing the action despite past opposition to foreign interventions. Meanwhile, China faces economic and diplomatic fallout from Maduro’s removal, as Beijing’s long-standing oil deals with Caracas hang in the balance. The crisis triggers debates in China over geopolitical strategy, with some viewing Venezuela as a cautionary tale for Taiwan. Elsewhere, Trump pushes domestic policies, targeting Wall Street’s single-family home purchases and defense contractors’ executive pay, while proposing a record $1.5 trillion military budget. In Europe, the UK grapples with China’s threats to cancel trade talks after a minister’s Taiwan visit, underscoring rising tensions over Taiwan’s status. Ukrainian businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on amid ongoing war, expanding exports despite persistent Russian attacks.

Corporate activity is heating up, highlighted by JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs and SpaceX's impending IPO, which could become the largest in history.
