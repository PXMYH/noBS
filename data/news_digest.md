## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate today's headlines. Donald Trump escalates diplomatic friction by linking his claims on Greenland to Norway's refusal to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, while the FAA issues warnings about military activity near Latin American airspace, signaling heightened regional instability. In energy markets, Vitol tests China's appetite for Venezuelan crude at narrower discounts, though analysts suggest U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage with Trump's aggressive push for Venezuelan oil, preferring domestic sources. Meanwhile, Japan's financial markets react to potential tax cuts ahead of a snap election, with bonds slumping and food stocks surging, while Eurozone finance ministers prepare to select the ECB's next vice president, setting the stage for future leadership transitions. The resignation of Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy marks a notable shift in the entertainment industry, though its broader implications remain limited.
