## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S. intervention in Venezuela dominates global headlines, with Nicolás Maduro's ouster sparking both geopolitical upheaval and economic speculation. The U.S. now effectively controls 40% of the world's oil reserves, a move that reshapes energy markets and diplomatic alliances. While investors eye Venezuela's $750 billion potential, analysts warn of risks tied to China's debt claims and unresolved rule-of-law issues. Meanwhile, China's internal debate over Venezuela's fate reflects broader tensions, with some viewing it as a template for Taiwan, while others caution against overreach. Elsewhere, emerging markets rally despite the turmoil, and Ukraine's war economy shows resilience as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports amid ongoing conflict. Diplomatic frictions persist, including China's threats to cancel UK trade talks over Taiwan and its ban on Japanese scallops as retaliation for perceived Taiwan support.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a mix of optimism and caution, as the S&P 500 notched fresh records amid a rotation into industrials, materials, and financials, while tech-driven gains continued to fuel bullish sentiment. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with traders placing record bets on interest-rate cuts following mixed signals from policymakers, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari’s suggestion that further reductions may be limited. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s potential reentry into global oil markets sparked volatility, lifting energy stocks but raising concerns about oversupply, while investors piled into Venezuelan bonds despite geopolitical risks. Corporate activity picked up, with Berkshire Hathaway’s new CEO Greg Abel securing a $25 million salary, Charter Communications issuing $3 billion in junk bonds, and Wall Street banks launching a $7 billion loan sale for Hologic’s buyout. Economic policy shifts, including the U.S. exemption from a global tax deal and Argentina’s dollar purchases ahead of debt payments, added to the complex landscape.
