## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. tightens its grip on Venezuela’s oil industry following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. President Donald Trump announces Venezuela will relinquish up to $2.8 billion worth of crude to the U.S., sparking market volatility and raising questions about China’s stake in the country’s debt. Meanwhile, Beijing escalates its feud with Japan, imposing export controls on military-sensitive goods and banning Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s Taiwan stance. The fallout from Maduro’s capture also triggers debates in China, with some viewing it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan. Elsewhere, the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace amid military operations, disrupting flights, while Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, push forward despite ongoing war challenges. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, and schools grapple with the rise of AI tools in education.

In the U.S., the Fed's policy path remains a focal point, with Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari suggesting limited room for further rate cuts, while a record bet on Fed funds futures signals heightened speculation ahead of key labor data. Corporate developments include Saks Global's leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors, SpaceX's highly anticipated IPO, and Comcast's spinoff of Versant, marking a rare media debut.
