## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions remain high as geopolitical and economic maneuvering dominates headlines. In the Middle East, President Donald Trump signals a temporary pause on potential military action against Iran, easing oil market pressures, while European nations, including Germany, deploy military personnel to Greenland in response to perceived U.S. threats. Denmark acknowledges lingering disagreements with Washington, underscoring transatlantic strains. Meanwhile, Canada’s former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair frayed Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S. economic policies face criticism. Analysts warn Trump’s aggressive pursuit of Venezuelan resources could undermine long-term U.S. economic stability, drawing historical parallels to colonial-era exploitation. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff defy wartime challenges, expanding exports to Western markets despite ongoing Russian attacks. Diplomatic tensions also flare between the UK and China after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks following a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, revealing the fragility of post-Brexit international relations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets and economic indicators present a mixed picture as 2026 begins. Germany’s economy shows signs of recovery, growing for the first time since 2022, thanks to government spending, while China faces weakening demand, with new loans shrinking to their lowest levels since 2018. In the U.S., inflation holds steady at 2.7%, but rising food prices and persistent cost-of-living concerns contrast with President Trump’s claims of economic victory. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reports reveal resilience in banking, with Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase exceeding expectations, though Wall Street remains on edge over Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which banks warn could disrupt lending. Major business developments include Netflix’s potential all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, signaling a shift in the streaming wars, and the high-profile bankruptcy of Saks Global, underscoring ongoing struggles in the luxury retail sector. Central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, face political pressure as global counterparts rally to defend Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s independence amid Trump’s criticism.
