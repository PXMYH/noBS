## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as the Trump administration takes aggressive steps on multiple fronts. The U.S. halts immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Iran, Russia, and Brazil, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting control over Venezuela’s oil resources—a move critics argue could undermine U.S. economic stability. Meanwhile, China reaffirms its opposition to the use of force in international relations, urging restraint amid U.S. threats against Iran following its crackdown on protesters. In a diplomatic shift, Canada’s Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained relations and explore new trade opportunities, signaling a pivot as U.S.-China ties deteriorate. The Trump administration’s bold but controversial actions—from visa restrictions to resource appropriation—risk further destabilizing geopolitical dynamics, with major powers like China and Canada recalibrating their strategies in response.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Wall Street banks delivered mixed earnings this week, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley outperforming expectations thanks to strong equities and wealth management divisions, while Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo faced pressure from President Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. The banking sector is scrambling to respond, with executives signaling potential legal and lobbying efforts to counter the policy, though no formal guidance has been issued. Meanwhile, Saks Global’s bankruptcy filing—stemming from its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus—highlights ongoing struggles in the retail sector, even as analysts suggest consumer demand remains resilient. In global markets, China reported a record $1.19 trillion trade surplus, defying Trump’s tariffs and raising concerns about overcapacity, while emerging-market stocks stabilized on optimism around AI-driven growth, led by Taiwan Semiconductor’s expansion plans. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with inflation holding steady at 2.7% in December, though Fed Governor Goolsbee warned that undermining central bank independence could reignite inflationary pressures.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape is dominated by major policy shifts and high-stakes financial moves this week. President Trump imposes a 25% tariff on advanced AI chips from Nvidia and AMD, citing national security concerns, while exempting data centers and consumers—a decision that could reshape the semiconductor trade landscape. Meanwhile, BlackRock and Microsoft's AI infrastructure partnership secures $12.5 billion in funding, underscoring the frenzied investment in AI-driven data centers and energy projects. The UK economy shows unexpected resilience with 0.3% growth in November, but global supply chain pressures persist as soaring memory chip prices squeeze tech hardware manufacturers like Apple. Regulatory battles also take center stage, with India's Supreme Court ruling that Tiger Global owes taxes on its Flipkart sale, and the US considering expanded private-sector roles in cyberwarfare. Against this backdrop, 2026 is shaping up as a potential banner year for mega IPOs, with SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic eyeing public debuts that could flood markets with capital.
