## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Europe, Germany accelerates defense industry collaboration as 500 companies, mostly newcomers, join a government-backed platform to bolster military supply chains—a sign of heightened security concerns. Meanwhile, the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions, reflecting rising protectionism amid a global glut driven by Chinese production. Across the Atlantic, President Trump escalates trade threats, potentially reigniting a trade war, while courts weigh limits on his tariff authority. His administration also faces challenges in Venezuela, where sanctions complicate U.S. investment despite Trump’s push for economic engagement. In Asia, Japan’s diplomatic spat with China over Taiwan deepens, with Chinese tourism plummeting after Tokyo’s warnings of military intervention. The yen’s volatility prompts speculation of U.S.-Japan currency intervention, while surging oil tanker rates highlight broader geopolitical risks disrupting global energy markets. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand an ICE withdrawal, underscoring growing civil unrest over immigration policies.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets opened the week on a mixed but resilient note, with US stocks advancing as strong corporate earnings outweighed lingering geopolitical and policy risks. Investors flocked to safe-haven assets, driving gold prices to a record high above $5,100 per ounce amid escalating trade tensions, including Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs on Canada and fears of a US government shutdown. The dollar weakened, boosting emerging-market currencies like the South African rand, while mining stocks and commodities surged as the 'hard-asset trade' gained momentum. Meanwhile, a severe winter storm disrupted travel and power across the US, with AccuWeather estimating potential economic losses of up to $115 billion. In corporate news, Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and China’s Zijin Mining $5.5 billion purchase of Allied Gold highlighted a busy M&A landscape, while Jennifer Garner’s organic snacks company, Once Upon a Farm, filed for a $209 million IPO. Central banks and economic indicators remained in focus, with the Fed’s delayed inflation data showing sticky price pressures, and traders speculating on potential currency interventions to support the yen.
