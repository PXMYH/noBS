## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing mixed signals as volatility in individual stocks contrasts with broader market calm. The U.S. economy shows resilience, with steady inflation at 2.7% in December, though rising food prices and consumer pessimism persist.

Meanwhile, corporate struggles highlight economic challenges: Saks Global files for bankruptcy, and China’s weak loan demand signals sluggish growth. Geopolitical risks, including trade conflicts and tariffs, dominate business concerns, with the World Economic Forum warning of economic fragmentation as a top global threat.

## 💻 Technology

The tech sector is riding high on AI-driven momentum, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) leading the charge. TSMC's robust $56 billion capital spending plan for 2026, announced this week, has reignited confidence in the AI boom, lifting tech stocks and propelling ASML Holding NV to a $500 billion market valuation. Meanwhile, regulatory and trade developments are reshaping the industry: President Trump imposes limited tariffs on foreign semiconductors, while the U.S. considers expanding private companies' role in cyberwarfare. Beyond tech, Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries, and Delta Air Lines forecasts a 20% profit surge amid strong travel demand. However, economic concerns linger as U.S. job growth hits a five-year low, and labor market tensions rise under Trump’s policies. In healthcare, Amazon Pharmacy begins offering Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy weight-loss pill, signaling a competitive shift in the obesity drug market.
