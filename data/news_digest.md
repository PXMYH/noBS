## 🌍 World & Politics

Global markets and geopolitical tensions dominate this week's headlines, with US President Donald Trump's aggressive rhetoric against Iran driving oil prices above $61 per barrel for the first time since October. Algorithmic traders are now bullish on crude, reflecting heightened concerns over potential supply disruptions in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Trump's push to expand US oil interests in Venezuela faces skepticism from energy executives, who remain wary of investing in the politically unstable nation. The move could further strain US economic influence, particularly as domestic shale producers already grapple with a supply glut and declining prices. In other developments, Colombia secures $5 billion in global bonds ahead of pivotal elections, signaling investor confidence in emerging markets despite broader economic uncertainties. Diplomatic tensions also flare as China threatens to cancel key trade talks with the UK following a British minister's visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing's sensitivity over the island's status. Elsewhere, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, highlighting the country's determination to maintain economic activity amid war.
