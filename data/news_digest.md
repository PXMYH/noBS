## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian energy infrastructure by striking Lukoil-owned oil platforms in the Caspian Sea, aiming to cripple Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making aggressive moves in Latin America, as President Trump pushes to secure Venezuela’s oil reserves—despite skepticism from major oil executives and concerns over political instability. The administration hints at lifting sanctions to facilitate oil sales, while commodity traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore potential deals with U.S. refiners. However, Trump’s broader strategy faces hurdles, including China’s deep economic ties in the region and Greenland’s firm rejection of U.S. annexation proposals. Elsewhere, diplomatic friction flares as China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, underscoring Beijing’s sensitivity to territorial issues. Domestically, Trump targets defense contractors for delays and calls for congressional action to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases, signaling a populist economic shift.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with cautious optimism as Asian stocks prepare to follow U.S. gains, buoyed by softer-than-expected jobs data that reinforces the Federal Reserve’s patient stance on rate cuts. Bond traders’ bets on a dovish Fed appear vindicated, though concerns linger about corporate bonds teetering on junk status. In commodities, gold remains a favored safe haven after its record 2025 rally, while oil prices stay volatile amid geopolitical tensions, including protests in Iran and U.S. intervention in Venezuela’s oil sector. Meanwhile, major business moves dominate headlines, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks to create a $260 billion mining giant, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. Corporate earnings reveal struggles in the auto and housing sectors—General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions, while the U.S. housing market shows signs of balancing after years of investor dominance. Geopolitical risks, particularly in Venezuela, are drawing investor attention, though markets remain largely unfazed by Trump’s aggressive policies, including a proposed cap on credit card interest rates and a push to reshape mortgage markets.
