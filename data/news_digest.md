## 🌍 World & Politics

Global economic and political tensions dominate headlines as President Trump's first year in office sparks controversy and concern. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's keynote speech signals a retreat from the liberal democratic order, raising fears of a leadership vacuum that China is poised to fill. Economists warn that while Trump's policies have yet to drastically alter the U.S. economy, their long-term effects could weaken the nation's standing. Meanwhile, Trump escalates trade war threats, even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority. The instability extends beyond the U.S., with Venezuela's economic crisis driving locals to adopt Tether's USDT stablecoin as a hedge against government volatility. Amid these geopolitical shifts, even lighter moments—like French President Macron's sunglasses at Davos—highlight the unusual dynamics of this year's global summit.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, policy shifts, and corporate maneuvering this week. The dollar is on track for its worst week since June amid concerns over unpredictable U.S. policymaking, while the yen surged sharply against the greenback, leaving traders speculating about the cause. Meanwhile, European markets face headwinds as political jitters in France and the UK weigh on business activity and bonds, with gilts heading for their worst week in two months. In corporate news, defense IPOs are thriving—Czech tycoon Michal Strnad’s armaments firm and CSG NV’s Amsterdam debut both saw shares soar—while Chinese firms grapple with U.S. mistrust post-TikTok. M&A activity is heating up, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and Chery’s purchase of Nissan’s South Africa plant, as companies adapt to shifting global trade dynamics. The Fed remains in focus, with speculation mounting over Jerome Powell’s future and Trump’s potential pick for the next chair, even as the Supreme Court signals reluctance to undermine the central bank’s independence. Retail traders continue to defy broader market trends, buying dips while institutional investors diversify away from U.S. assets.

## 💻 Technology

This week's tech and business landscape is dominated by major corporate maneuvers, regulatory shifts, and AI-driven market trends. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid geopolitical tensions, while Netflix's $1.5 billion ad revenue in 2025—projecting to double this year—signals a strategic pivot paying off. Meanwhile, TikTok's restructuring under new U.S. ownership raises questions about app changes for its 200 million American users, as regulatory scrutiny intensifies. The IMF's upgraded global growth forecast, fueled by AI investment, contrasts with warnings from Ericsson's CEO about the EU's tech sovereignty push, which he calls 'dangerous' for the bloc's competitiveness. In other developments, the U.S. Supreme Court appears skeptical of Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, highlighting ongoing tensions over executive authority. Smaller AI infrastructure firms are also gaining traction as critical players in the sector's expansion, challenging Big Tech's dominance.
