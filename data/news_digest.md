## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a mix of optimism and caution, as US stocks climbed to fresh highs following a December jobs report that reinforced the Federal Reserve’s patient stance on interest rates. Traders scaled back bets on an imminent rate cut after unemployment fell more than expected, sending Treasury yields higher and dampening hopes for near-term monetary easing. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk, with notable developments including Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks to create the world’s largest mining company, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. In emerging markets, Senegal’s bonds surged after its leader ruled out debt restructuring, while Venezuela’s $60 billion bond restructuring talks drew investor attention amid geopolitical tensions. The energy sector also saw movement, with President Trump outlining plans to leverage Venezuela’s oil reserves to drive US crude prices down to $50 a barrel, though skepticism persists over the feasibility of such a move. Elsewhere, IPOs and private credit deals highlighted investor appetite for growth, with Aktis Oncology jumping 50% in its debut and Adams Street Partners leading a $400 million private debt deal for a defense equipment business.
