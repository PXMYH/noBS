## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with geopolitical risks driving up oil tanker rates as instability in Venezuela and Iran disrupts crude transport. In trade, President Trump escalates threats, vowing a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China, while the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut and rising protectionism. Currency markets remain volatile, with the dollar weakening as Japan signals potential intervention to prop up the yen. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains deepen between China and Japan, with Chinese tourism to Japan plummeting after Tokyo's remarks on Taiwan, while Venezuela's economic turmoil pushes locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT for stability. Domestic unrest also flares in the U.S., where Minnesota sees mass protests against ICE operations, demanding the agency's withdrawal from the state.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are in flux as geopolitical tensions and shifting monetary policies drive volatility. Gold surges past $5,000 an ounce, hitting record highs as investors flee sovereign bonds and currencies amid uncertainty over U.S. trade policies and geopolitical risks. The dollar weakens further, with speculation mounting over potential U.S.-Japan currency intervention to stabilize the yen. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust: China’s Zijin Mining acquires Allied Gold for $4 billion, and Capital One buys fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion. However, economic indicators paint a mixed picture—German business confidence unexpectedly drops, while U.S. small-business optimism ticks up. The Federal Reserve faces pressure as inflation remains sticky, with traders betting on a potential leadership shift after Trump praises BlackRock’s Rick Rieder. Against this backdrop, Wall Street braces for risks in the booming $3.4 trillion private credit market, while SpaceX prepares for a blockbuster IPO that could value the company at $800 billion.

## 💻 Technology

This week’s tech and business landscape is dominated by AI’s growing influence and regulatory shifts. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s upcoming visit to China underscores the chipmaker’s efforts to navigate slowing AI chip sales amid U.S.-China tensions, while a broader AI stock rout, triggered by China’s DeepSeek advancements, sends shockwaves through markets. Meanwhile, TikTok’s corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about data privacy and platform changes for its 200 million American users. Beyond tech, automakers face mounting uncertainty as consumer demand wanes and affordability crises persist, while the IMF warns of AI’s 'tsunami-like' impact on labor markets, particularly for young workers. Regulatory moves, from U.S. seabed mining rules to potential European pushback on media mergers like WBD-Netflix, add layers of complexity to global trade and industry dynamics.

## ⚽ Sports

The sports world sees major developments in winter events and golf this week. The 2029 Asian Winter Games, originally planned for Saudi Arabia’s futuristic Neom desert resort, face postponement after an agreement between Saudi officials and the Olympic Council of Asia. The decision casts uncertainty over the ambitious project’s readiness to host large-scale winter sports. Meanwhile, media coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy hits a snag as *The Washington Post* abruptly scraps its planned reporting, signaling potential logistical or editorial challenges just weeks before the Games begin. In golf, the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league strengthens its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s properties, announcing another tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey—marking at least the sixth event held at Trump venues since the league’s inception. The move underscores the ongoing intersection of sports, politics, and business in the evolving golf landscape.
