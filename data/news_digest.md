## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with geopolitical and domestic developments shaping key narratives. In the U.S., President Trump's aggressive trade stance takes center stage as he threatens a new trade war, even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority. His speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he renounced liberal democratic principles, signals a further retreat from global leadership, leaving a vacuum China appears poised to fill. Meanwhile, domestic unrest flares in Minnesota, where a statewide strike protests ICE operations, with organizers demanding the agency's removal and an investigation into alleged constitutional violations. The Pentagon's attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*—criticized as 'woke'—sparks pushback from lawmakers and the outlet's leadership, highlighting ongoing debates over press freedom within the armed forces. Economically, wheat prices surge amid fears of crop damage from freezing weather in the U.S. and Russia, compounding concerns over food security. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to the USDT stablecoin as a hedge against political and economic instability, underscoring the growing reliance on cryptocurrencies in volatile regimes. Against this backdrop, lighter moments emerge, such as the sudden demand for French President Macron’s sunglasses after he wore them at Davos to conceal a burst blood vessel, offering a brief distraction from the forum’s weighty geopolitical discussions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets closed a volatile week on shaky ground, with the S&P 500 heading for its second consecutive weekly decline as investors shifted focus back to earnings and monetary policy. Intel’s shares plunged after a weak forecast and manufacturing woes, while the Bank of Japan’s decision to hold rates spurred yen volatility. Meanwhile, the dollar faced its worst week since June amid concerns over unpredictable U.S. policymaking ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting. Geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties added to the unease, with Trump’s tariff reversals and legal battles—including a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan—further rattling markets. In commodities, copper surged past $13,000 a ton, and gold eyed its best week since 2020 as safe-haven demand rose. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s reported preparations for a blockbuster IPO. Defense stocks also saw strong demand, with CSG NV’s debut soaring amid rising global tensions. Central banks remained active, with India injecting $23.6 billion to ease liquidity, while private credit risks and a potential Fed leadership shift under Trump added layers of uncertainty to the economic outlook.
