## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical tensions and domestic policy shifts dominate headlines this week. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is reportedly considering a temporary suspension of the sales tax on food as part of her election campaign, signaling potential economic relief ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution. Meanwhile, the U.S. under President Donald Trump continues to make bold moves, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The administration also warns of heightened military activity in Latin American waters, with the FAA advising caution for flights over parts of the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. On the energy front, Venezuela signs its first LPG export deal under Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage with Trump’s push for Venezuelan oil, preferring domestic sources. Diplomatically, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations amid worsening U.S.-China ties, highlighting shifting global alliances.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are navigating a mix of political pressure and economic signals as President Trump's aggressive policy moves—including a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates and a Justice Department probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell—rattle financial institutions and central bank independence. The Fed remains cautiously optimistic, with Vice Chair Philip Jefferson calling current policy 'well positioned,' but concerns linger over inflation and the potential fallout from political interference. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal uneven performance: while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs beat estimates, major banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America face headwinds from regulatory uncertainty. In equities, small-cap stocks outperform as the Russell 2000 rallies, and Novo Nordisk surges 8% on strong demand for its obesity drug Wegovy. Elsewhere, IPO activity heats up with defense firm York Space Systems and biopharma SpyGlass filing for public offerings, while Saks' bankruptcy and Amazon's $475 million write-down highlight retail sector strains. Global markets also see shifts, with Ecuador eyeing a return to debt markets and central banks stockpiling gold amid dollar skepticism.
