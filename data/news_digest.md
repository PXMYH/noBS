## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The raid, confirmed by President Donald Trump, has sparked a major shift in Venezuelan politics, with Trump stating the U.S. will temporarily oversee the country until a transition can be arranged. Financial markets are reacting cautiously, with Venezuelan bonds rallying on hopes of regime change, while Saudi stocks dropped amid broader geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, the oil market remains largely unaffected, as analysts suggest global supplies can absorb any potential disruptions from Venezuela. The U.S. has also closed airspace over the Caribbean, citing safety concerns, leading to flight cancellations. In other diplomatic news, China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK after a British minister visited Taiwan, escalating tensions over the island’s status. Additionally, Japan faces economic pressure from China, which has banned Japanese scallop imports in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. Domestically, the Trump administration’s restructuring of the federal workforce continues to draw scrutiny, with critics arguing it has weakened government efficiency.
