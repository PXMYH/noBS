## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic shifts, with President Trump's unpredictable trade policies—including tariff threats and reversals—dominating headlines. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are holding interest rates steady amid lingering inflation concerns, while investors flock to high-risk junk bonds, signaling confidence in corporate stability. Meanwhile, major corporate moves are reshaping industries: Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex highlights consolidation in fintech, while SpaceX's potential IPO could mark one of the largest tech listings. In China, a diverging economy is splitting the stock market, with industrial exporters thriving as consumer-facing firms struggle. Small businesses in the U.S. show resilience, but private credit risks and Fed independence concerns loom large as Trump's legal battles with JPMorgan and pressure on the central bank escalate.
