## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with the Trump administration making bold moves on immigration and foreign policy. The U.S. indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, tightening Defense Department control amid accusations of political bias. In Latin America, economic instability ahead of presidential elections in Brazil and Colombia prompts Morgan Stanley to pull investments, reflecting growing unease over fiscal policies. On the diplomatic front, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S.-China ties deteriorate. Analysts warn that Trump’s aggressive push for Venezuela’s oil resources could backfire, undermining U.S. economic influence in the long term.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing signs of broadening beyond tech giants, with small-cap stocks gaining traction as investors anticipate economic resilience without relying on rate cuts. However, volatility persists in commodities, with European gas prices surging over 30% due to cold weather and supply concerns, while oil recovers slightly amid geopolitical tensions in Iran. Corporate earnings present a mixed picture: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs beat estimates, driven by wealth management and asset growth, but Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo face pressure from President Trump’s proposed credit card rate cap, which sent financial stocks tumbling. Meanwhile, Trump’s economic policies—including tariffs, housing restrictions, and Fed interference—continue to rattle markets, with the Bank of England’s governor warning against populist threats to central bank independence. In M&A and corporate struggles, Saks’ bankruptcy filing after its Neiman Marcus acquisition highlights retail sector woes, while Amazon threatens legal action over its $475 million stake now deemed worthless. Emerging markets are drawing attention, with Ecuador and Benin tapping international debt markets, and Africa’s bond yields attracting yield-hungry investors.
