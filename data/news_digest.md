## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate this week’s headlines, with Europe’s escalating standoff with Russia taking center stage. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens its grip on immigration, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The Pentagon also makes waves by overhauling the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing it as 'woke' and increasing Defense Department control. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about heightened military activity in Pacific waters near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, raising concerns over regional stability. On the economic front, President Trump’s recent $1 million investment in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds follows his pledge to influence their merger approval, while oil giants remain hesitant to engage with his ambitious plans for Venezuela’s oil reserves.

The Fed’s independence is under scrutiny following a DOJ investigation into Chair Jerome Powell, while the Bank of Japan’s upcoming meeting keeps yen traders on edge. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal divergent fortunes: Novo Nordisk surges on strong obesity drug sales, while major US banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America face pressure from regulatory risks. Emerging markets see a private credit boom, with sovereign wealth funds pivoting toward high-yield opportunities, while China’s rare-earth export decline highlights escalating trade frictions with Japan.
