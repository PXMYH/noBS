## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warns of potential intervention to stabilize the yen, signaling rare coordination with the U.S. amid currency volatility. Meanwhile, U.S. domestic politics heat up as Senate Democrats threaten a government shutdown over funding disputes tied to immigration enforcement, while mass protests erupt in Minnesota against ICE operations. On the trade front, President Trump intensifies protectionist measures, threatening Canada with 100% tariffs over potential China deals and pushing for U.S. investment in Venezuela despite lingering sanctions. China's diplomatic rift with Japan deepens as Chinese tourism plummets following Tokyo's stance on Taiwan, while Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge. The UK also joins the protectionist trend, considering stricter steel import limits amid global oversupply.

In corporate news, Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's preparations for a potential $800 billion IPO highlight robust dealmaking, even as risks in private credit and China's stock market volatility loom.
