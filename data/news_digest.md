## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The Trump administration also makes waves in corporate and foreign policy, with President Trump purchasing $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds following their merger announcement, while his push to exploit Venezuela’s oil faces skepticism from major energy firms. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about military activity over parts of the Pacific Ocean near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling heightened regional tensions.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. grocery market, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discount retailers. The German-owned chain’s aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi capturing a larger share of weekly shopping trips across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures drive shoppers to prioritize value without sacrificing quality. Aldi’s strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further challenging traditional supermarkets and rivals like Walmart and Kroger. Industry analysts note that this expansion could reshape the retail landscape, forcing competitors to adjust pricing and promotions to retain customers.
