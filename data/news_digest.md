## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as the U.S. conducts a military raid in Venezuela, ousting President Nicolás Maduro and triggering a scramble for control of the country’s vast oil reserves. The move has sent shockwaves through international markets, with oil prices fluctuating amid uncertainty over Venezuela’s future production and U.S. plans to revive its energy sector. Meanwhile, China faces a strategic dilemma as its long-standing economic ties with Venezuela—including billions in loans—hang in the balance, sparking domestic debates over Beijing’s approach to Taiwan and global influence. The geopolitical fallout extends to trade disputes, with China retaliating against Japan over Taiwan tensions by banning scallop imports and threatening to cancel UK trade talks following a minister’s visit to Taipei. Closer to home, U.S. domestic policies see the dissolution of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after federal funding cuts, while airlines cancel flights as the FAA restricts Caribbean airspace due to the Venezuela operation. Amid the turmoil, businesses in Ukraine demonstrate resilience, expanding exports despite ongoing war, while investors like Michael Burry capitalize on the shifting energy landscape.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by high-stakes corporate battles, AI-driven workforce shifts, and geopolitical tensions. Warner Bros. Discovery's board repeatedly rejects Paramount's $108 billion hostile takeover bid, favoring a deal with Netflix instead, signaling a major shift in media consolidation. Meanwhile, AI continues to reshape industries, with companies adopting four-day workweeks as automation handles more tasks, and Vista Equity Partners pushing 'agentic AI' to redefine enterprise software. Geopolitical strains are evident as China threatens rare earth export restrictions, alarming Japan, and the U.S. makes aggressive moves in Venezuela, disrupting travel and oil markets. In tech, BYD surpasses Tesla as the world's top EV seller after U.S. subsidy cuts, while data center expansions spark political backlash amid AI infrastructure growth. Financial markets remain volatile, with traders betting on lower Treasury yields and Citadel's hedge fund posting strong gains despite broader uncertainty.
