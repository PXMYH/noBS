Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns.
