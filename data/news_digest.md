## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with a series of bold and controversial moves. The State Department indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil resources faces skepticism from major oil giants, who find domestic production more viable. Analysts warn his approach could undermine U.S. economic strength rather than bolster it. On the domestic front, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, tightening Defense Department control amid accusations of political bias. Internationally, Canada’s former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair frayed Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa’s pivot toward new trade partnerships as U.S. ties grow increasingly volatile.

Meanwhile, South Africa's rand is on its longest winning streak since 2002, buoyed by rising precious metal prices and economic optimism. In tech and trade, the Trump administration imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI325X, citing national security concerns, while also finalizing a trade deal with Taiwan that lowers tariffs and secures commitments for more U.S. chip factories. Activists in Iran are increasingly relying on smuggled Starlink systems to bypass government internet blackouts, highlighting the growing role of satellite internet in circumventing censorship. On the corporate front, Boeing outsells Airbus for the first time since 2018, delivering 600 jetliners in 2025, though its reputation faces scrutiny after revelations that it knew about flaws in a UPS plane that later crashed. The financial sector sees JPMorgan's profits dip to $57 billion in 2025, with CEO Jamie Dimon pointing to deregulation as a future catalyst, while the UK economy posts a better-than-expected 0.3% growth in November, defying budget uncertainties.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi, the discount grocery chain, is accelerating its U.S. expansion with plans to open over 180 new stores in 2026, capitalizing on growing consumer demand for value-driven shopping. The move underscores intensifying competition in the grocery sector, as budget-conscious shoppers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly needs. Aldi's aggressive growth strategy reflects broader economic trends, with inflation and cost-of-living pressures driving consumers across income levels to seek affordable alternatives to traditional supermarkets. The expansion also highlights the shifting retail landscape, where discounters are gaining market share by offering lower prices without sacrificing quality. Industry analysts note that Aldi's push could further disrupt major players like Walmart and Kroger, forcing them to adjust pricing and promotions to retain customers.
