## 🌍 World & Politics

{
    "summary": "The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signals potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales, while major traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious about investing in the politically unstable country, despite Trump’s $100 billion plan to revive its energy sector. The shift in Venezuela’s leadership also eases tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from reduced border disputes amid its booming oil industry. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the US expands its influence in a region where Beijing has long held economic dominance, particularly as Mexico sends oil shipments to Cuba, further straining US relations.

Elsewhere, domestic and international tensions persist. In Hong Kong, authorities rule out reusing a fire-ravaged housing estate, while Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejects Trump’s annexation proposals. Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and China previously threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, highlighting ongoing geopolitical friction. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on with exports despite wartime challenges, underscoring resilience amid conflict.",
