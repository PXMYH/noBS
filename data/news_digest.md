## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic maneuvers dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector drawing widespread skepticism. Despite his efforts to rally U.S. oil executives and Congress, major firms remain hesitant due to political instability and China’s deep-rooted influence in Latin America. Meanwhile, China tightens its grip on domestic markets, launching an antitrust probe into food-delivery giants like Meituan and Alibaba to curb price wars, while also flexing diplomatic muscle by threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and Ukrainian businesses, including a bombed vodka maker, defiantly expand exports amid ongoing war. Domestically, Trump targets defense contractors for delays and seeks to block Wall Street’s single-family home purchases, signaling a broader economic nationalist agenda.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic and political uncertainties as 2026 begins. The Federal Reserve faces heightened scrutiny after the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Chair Jerome Powell, tied to his testimony on Fed renovations, sparking concerns over central bank independence. The dollar weakened sharply, while gold surged to record highs amid geopolitical tensions, including protests in Iran. Meanwhile, emerging Asian markets rallied following a softer-than-expected U.S. jobs report, though India’s stock recovery is clouded by slowing earnings growth. Corporate activity is also in focus, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks to create the world’s largest mining firm, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. In China, property giant Vanke struggles with debt restructuring, while Venezuela’s bonds attract Wall Street interest despite lingering risks. The U.S. trade deficit hit a 17-year low due to Trump’s tariffs, but his push for a 10% credit card interest rate cap draws bank criticism. Housing markets show signs of balancing, though New Zealand expects only modest price gains despite economic recovery.
