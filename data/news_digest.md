## 🌍 World & Politics

The geopolitical landscape is dominated by the fallout from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who pleaded not guilty in a New York court. The move has triggered widespread reactions, with China debating its implications for Taiwan and markets rallying despite heightened tensions. Venezuela's oil industry faces uncertainty as Chinese buyers retreat due to U.S. sanctions, while European defense stocks and precious metals surge amid geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, the U.S. under President Trump continues to reshape global dynamics, from military interventions to defunding domestic institutions like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Elsewhere, China's strategic dominance in rare earths and its trade disputes with Japan over Taiwan highlight ongoing regional tensions, while businesses in Ukraine adapt to wartime challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with mixed signals as investors weighed economic resilience against lingering uncertainties. Equities extended their record-breaking rally, with Chinese stocks surging to four-year highs on AI optimism and signs of recovery, while copper prices hit fresh records above $13,000 per ton amid tight supply and strong US demand. However, concerns about a global oil glut persisted, with Saudi Arabia cutting crude prices to Asia for a third month and Venezuela’s output recovery remaining sluggish despite geopolitical tensions. In corporate news, Jollibee Foods announced plans for a US listing of its international business, while Saks Global faced leadership changes amid bankruptcy rumors. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes revealed deep divisions over further rate cuts, with officials split on whether inflation or unemployment poses a greater risk. The Fed’s cautious stance contrasts with robust credit markets, which saw a $61 billion bond issuance surge in a single day, signaling strong investor appetite for debt.
