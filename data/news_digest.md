## 🌍 World & Politics

President Donald Trump is aggressively pursuing a major economic and geopolitical play in Venezuela, pushing U.S. oil executives to invest in the country’s vast reserves following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro. Despite Trump’s assurances that Venezuela is 'open for business,' major oil companies remain hesitant due to political instability and long-term risks, though hedge funds are growing bullish on oil amid broader regional unrest, including deadly protests in Iran. The administration’s moves in Latin America are drawing scrutiny from China, which has long held significant economic influence in the region, while Greenland’s leadership firmly rejects Trump’s renewed calls for annexation, citing national sovereignty. Meanwhile, domestic political tensions rise as Democratic lawmakers demand an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump presses Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes to address housing affordability. Internationally, China’s diplomatic pressure on the UK over a minister’s Taiwan visit underscores Beijing’s escalating assertiveness on territorial issues.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a risk-on rally, as US stocks surged to fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq extended their bullish run, fueled by strong corporate earnings and a synchronized cross-asset rally, though December’s jobs report reinforced the Fed’s cautious stance on future cuts. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s appetite for risk assets—from meme stocks to high-yield bonds—showed no signs of abating, even as geopolitical tensions and Trump’s tariff policies loomed. In corporate news, Rio Tinto and Glencore revived merger talks in a potential $260 billion deal that could reshape the mining sector, while General Motors reported a $7.1 billion earnings hit after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions. The housing market saw mixed signals, with Trump ordering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds to boost affordability, even as real estate agents noted a shift toward more balanced conditions. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s oil sector took center stage as Trump pushed for US investment to tap its reserves, though Exxon’s CEO called the country ‘uninvestable’ without major reforms. The SEC also dropped a long-running fraud case against Rio Tinto’s former CFO, while Aktis Oncology’s IPO soared 24% in its debut, highlighting continued biotech investor enthusiasm.
