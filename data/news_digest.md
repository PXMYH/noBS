## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with the Trump administration making bold moves on multiple fronts. The U.S. indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil resources faces skepticism from energy giants, who see domestic production as a more viable alternative. Analysts warn the move could undermine U.S. economic stability, drawing parallels to historical resource exploitation. In Asia, Japan’s finance minister signals potential currency intervention under a U.S. agreement, aiming to curb the yen’s decline, while Canada’s Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair ties and explore trade opportunities amid worsening U.S.-China relations. Domestically, the Pentagon’s plan to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*—labeling it 'woke'—sparks debate over press freedom and political influence in the armed forces.

Global markets are experiencing mixed signals as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts shape investor sentiment. Energy stocks continue their rally amid rising geopolitical risks, while commodities like silver and oil remain volatile. The Federal Reserve faces pressure from the Trump administration, with concerns over central bank independence and potential inflation resurgence if political interference persists.

In M&A news, Netflix’s co-CEO defends the company’s controversial acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s film and TV business, while Saks Global’s bankruptcy filing—stemming from its debt-laden Neiman Marcus purchase—highlights risks in the luxury retail sector. Overseas, South Korea’s stock exchange explores riskier ETFs to lure retail investors, and India’s rupee weakens amid foreign outflows, contrasting with Canada’s trade thaw with China on crop tariffs.
