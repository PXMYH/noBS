## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate today's headlines, with the U.S. grappling with multiple foreign policy challenges. President Trump warns Iran's leadership to show 'humanity' toward protesters as the death toll surpasses 2,500, though experts suggest U.S. intervention may not be the best path forward. Meanwhile, Trump's push to revive Venezuela's oil sector faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives, who are wary of investing in the politically unstable nation. The move could further destabilize global oil markets, already strained by a supply glut and declining prices, potentially undermining U.S. economic leverage. In Asia, Canada's former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Japan's financial markets show signs of unease as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's potential snap election sparks concerns over rising debt. Elsewhere, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, while diplomatic tensions flare after China threatened to cancel UK trade talks following a British minister's visit to Taiwan.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing a dynamic start to 2026, with metals leading a blistering rally as gold, silver, copper, and tin all hit record highs amid expectations of U.S. rate cuts and renewed optimism in Chinese markets. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces unprecedented political pressure, with a Justice Department probe into Chair Jerome Powell drawing sharp criticism from global central bankers and former Fed officials, who warn of threats to the institution’s independence. Corporate America is grappling with mixed fortunes: JPMorgan Chase posts strong earnings, while Saks’ bankruptcy filing underscores the struggles of traditional retailers. China’s trade surplus surges to a record $1.2 trillion, fueled by weak currency policies and robust exports, even as trade tensions with Europe ease slightly. Against this backdrop, President Trump’s economic policies—including proposed credit card rate caps and tariffs—spark debate over their potential impact on consumers and businesses.
