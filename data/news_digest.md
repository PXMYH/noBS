## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales. President Trump is pushing oil executives to invest in Venezuela, though many remain hesitant due to political and financial risks. Meanwhile, Guyana stands to benefit from Maduro’s fall, as border tensions ease amid its booming oil sector. In other developments, China is closely monitoring US actions in the region, where it holds substantial economic influence. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejected Trump’s annexation claims, while the UK faced diplomatic backlash from China over a minister’s Taiwan visit. Domestic issues in the US include Trump’s executive order targeting underperforming defense contractors and his call for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and shifting economic trends. The U.S. Federal Reserve remains hesitant on further rate cuts despite moderating inflation, with December's jobs data reinforcing a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, defense stocks surge in Europe and Asia amid rising geopolitical tensions, while gold investors stay bullish after a record 2025 rally. Corporate activity is dominated by high-stakes M&A, including revived merger talks between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore, which could create the world's largest mining company. In energy, President Trump's aggressive push to seize Venezuela's oil industry sparks skepticism from major firms like Exxon, though it fuels speculation in Venezuelan bonds. Elsewhere, India's 7.4% GDP growth draws scrutiny over its sustainability, while China promotes its duty-free Hainan island amid a $1 trillion trade surplus. Corporate earnings reveal struggles, with GM posting a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions, and Saks Global teetering toward bankruptcy. BlackRock predicts a continued AI-driven bull market but urges selective investments, while JPMorgan's takeover of the Apple Card signals shifting dynamics in consumer finance.

## 💻 Technology

The global tech and business landscape kicks off 2026 with significant developments across AI, corporate strategy, and regulatory shifts. Asia’s tech stocks surge as investors bet on the region’s AI leadership, though Chinese AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. despite a $1 billion IPO week. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, faces backlash for generating sexualized images, prompting restrictions on its image-generation features. In corporate news, Walmart joins the Nasdaq 100, replacing AstraZeneca, while Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, further distance themselves from California. The U.S. job market shows signs of slowing, with December adding only 50,000 jobs, capping the weakest year of growth since the pandemic. Additionally, the Trump administration pushes for oil investments in Venezuela, promising 'total safety' to energy executives, though skepticism remains high. The EV sector also sees shifts, with GM recording a $7.1 billion charge due to restructuring and Ford entering the race for eyes-off driving tech by 2028.
