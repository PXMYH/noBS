The tech and business landscape is buzzing with major developments, from high-stakes acquisitions to regulatory battles and AI-driven market shifts. Netflix makes a bold $83 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming to outmaneuver Paramount in a deal that could reshape the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, AI continues to dominate discussions at Davos, where global leaders grapple with its economic and ethical implications, even as a market rout sparked by China's DeepSeek sends AI infrastructure stocks tumbling. Regulatory tensions escalate as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, while his administration imposes new tariffs on European countries and semiconductors, further complicating global trade dynamics. In corporate news, Boeing outsells Airbus for the first time since 2018, and BYD’s rise as a top EV maker underscores China’s growing dominance in the sector. Against this backdrop, the IMF upgrades its global growth forecast to 3.3%, citing AI investment as a key driver, though concerns linger over energy costs and geopolitical instability.
