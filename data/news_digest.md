## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic policy shifts dominate global headlines this week. In the U.S., the Trump administration tightens immigration controls by halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. Meanwhile, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, alleging ideological bias, while the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama. Internationally, China intensifies its anti-corruption drive, punishing 69 high-ranking officials, while Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi considers suspending food sales taxes ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution. Venezuela makes strides in energy diplomacy, signing its first LPG export deal, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage despite Trump’s interest in the country’s resources. On the diplomatic front, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations amid worsening U.S.-China ties.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are navigating a complex landscape shaped by political pressure, corporate earnings, and shifting monetary policy. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point as President Trump's administration escalates its push for lower interest rates, with former Fed officials warning that such interference risks undermining central bank independence. Meanwhile, Wall Street is adapting to Trump's disruptive agenda, including a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates—a move banks fiercely oppose—while also grappling with the fallout from high-profile bankruptcies like Saks and Neiman Marcus. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong early sales of its obesity drug Wegovy, and defense firm York Space Systems filed for a $544 million IPO. Elsewhere, central banks are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against dollar volatility, and prediction markets are gaining traction, drawing interest from Goldman Sachs and sparking regulatory debates.
