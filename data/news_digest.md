## 📰 Other News

Global economic and political shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive policies reshaping international relations and domestic markets. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, the traditional focus on climate cooperation has given way to deference toward Trump’s unilateral approach, exemplified by tensions over Greenland and a push for Arctic expansion in Nome, Alaska. Meanwhile, economic pressures persist: Botswana braces for prolonged weak diamond prices, while Kenya’s state-owned pipeline plans a major IPO to fund infrastructure growth. In the U.S., housing affordability remains a flashpoint, with Trump’s administration clashing over mortgage policies even as food prices surge. Cultural trends also stand out, from Gen Z’s Y2K fashion revival to the immersive theater boom redefining Broadway hits like *Phantom of the Opera*. Corporate maneuvering is equally notable, with Netflix potentially revising its Warner Bros. Discovery bid and AllianzGI securing $690 million for climate-focused blended finance.
