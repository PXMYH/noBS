## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines, with Venezuela at the center of a high-stakes power struggle. The Trump administration is aggressively pursuing control over Venezuela’s oil reserves, proposing a $100 billion investment plan and claiming access to 50 million barrels, though major oil companies remain hesitant due to political instability. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipment to Cuba escalates tensions with the U.S., underscoring Latin America’s shifting alliances as China maintains its strong economic foothold in the region. In other developments, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, while China’s threat to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit highlights Beijing’s assertive diplomatic stance. Domestically, Trump seeks expanded powers to pressure defense contractors and curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases, signaling a broader push to reshape economic and military policies.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals in early 2026, with U.S. stocks lagging behind international peers despite a strong 2025 driven by AI optimism. Investors are diversifying away from the dollar, while defense stocks surge amid geopolitical tensions. Gold remains a favored asset after its record 2025 rally, though gains may moderate. Meanwhile, the Fed maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts, awaiting clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as inflation cools in economies like Egypt and India. Corporate earnings reveal struggles, with General Motors posting a $7.1 billion loss due to scaled-back EV ambitions, while merger talks between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore reignite, potentially creating the world’s largest mining company. Venezuela’s oil sector dominates headlines as Trump pushes for U.S. investment, though industry skepticism persists amid political risks.
