## 🌍 World & Politics

Global economic and political tensions dominate headlines as China strengthens its energy ties with Russia, importing record volumes of Russian LNG despite Western sanctions, while India reduces its purchases, driving down Urals crude prices in China. Meanwhile, President Trump’s isolationist policies at the World Economic Forum signal a retreat from U.S. leadership in the global economy, raising concerns among economists about long-term economic weakening. Domestically, Trump faces legal challenges to his tariff authority but continues to threaten a new trade war, even as Congress moves to avert a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal. In Minnesota, a planned economic blackout protests federal immigration enforcement, reflecting growing civil unrest. Financial markets react to political shifts, with Japan’s super-long bonds rebounding after a selloff triggered by tax-cut pledges from newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Amid geopolitical instability, Venezuelans and others in volatile economies increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies like USDT for financial security.
