## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic policy shifts dominate this week's headlines, with the Trump administration making bold moves on multiple fronts. The U.S. indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, former Biden advisor Amos Hochstein warns against applying a 'Venezuela playbook' to Iran, emphasizing the complexity of regime change in Tehran. The administration's aggressive push to control Venezuela's oil resources faces skepticism, as analysts argue domestic production remains a more viable option for U.S. energy needs. On the diplomatic front, Canada's former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair frayed Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa's pivot away from U.S. dependence amid worsening bilateral ties. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, sparking concerns over political interference after job applicants were questioned about loyalty to Trump's policies.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic optimism and policy uncertainty, with Wall Street banks reporting strong trading revenues but facing pressure from potential credit card rate caps proposed by President Trump. Major financial institutions like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley posted robust earnings, driven by wealth management and trading, though concerns linger over regulatory threats to the Fed's independence. Meanwhile, Japan's economy stands at a tipping point as a weak yen fuels inflation, while China's record trade surplus underscores its export dominance. Corporate struggles are also in focus, with Saks Global filing for bankruptcy after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus, and Amazon threatening legal action over its $475 million stake in the failed deal. In commodities, silver prices retreated after Trump delayed tariffs on critical minerals, while AI-driven stock rallies and rising food costs add to market volatility.
