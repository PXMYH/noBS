## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious amid political uncertainty, and Trump’s $100 billion investment plan faces skepticism. The shift in Venezuela also eases tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from reduced border disputes. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the US expands its influence in a region where Beijing has long held economic dominance. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and the UK faces diplomatic strain with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit threatened trade talks. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as inflation trends show signs of stabilization, though risks linger. U.S. inflation remains subdued, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s measured approach to rate cuts, while Egypt’s steady inflation may pave the way for further easing. However, corporate bond markets face pressure as more firms teeter on the edge of junk status, reflecting underlying economic strains. Meanwhile, geopolitical and policy shifts dominate headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector drawing skepticism from major energy firms like Exxon, which deem the country 'uninvestable' without significant reforms. The proposed merger between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore, potentially creating a $260 billion behemoth, signals consolidation in the resources sector, while defense stocks rally amid global instability. In corporate news, General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions, and Saks Global struggles to secure financing ahead of a possible bankruptcy. Gold investors remain bullish after a record 2025 rally, and BlackRock predicts a surge in retail crypto adoption, highlighting shifting investment trends.
