Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate earnings this week. The Bank of Japan's upcoming meeting has yen traders on edge amid speculation over rate hikes, while the Federal Reserve faces renewed scrutiny after transcripts revealed Chair Jerome Powell's 2020 rate guidance decisions. Meanwhile, President Trump's threats to cap credit card rates and sue JPMorgan Chase over alleged debanking have rattled financial institutions, with banks pushing back against the proposed 10% rate ceiling. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong Wegovy sales, and HDFC Bank beat earnings estimates on robust loan growth, though margins remained pressured. Geopolitical strains are also evident, as China's rare-earth exports decline amid tensions with Japan, and the EU threatens to halt a U.S. trade deal over Trump's tariff threats. Gold demand is rising among central banks as a hedge against dollar volatility, while Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 tourism push highlights its shift away from oil dependence.
