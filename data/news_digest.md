## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, sparking geopolitical and economic shockwaves. Maduro pleaded not guilty in a New York court to narco-terrorism charges, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal and diplomatic battle. The ouster disrupts Venezuela’s oil sector, sending ripples through global markets—Canada’s heavy crude prices slump, while oil edges up amid uncertainty over future production. Investors like Michael Burry and Stone Harbor Capital are positioning for potential shifts, though China’s oil deals with Venezuela now face uncertainty. Meanwhile, tensions flare between the U.S. and Colombia over Maduro’s removal, and the FAA closes Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks. Beyond Venezuela, China’s diplomatic pressures intensify, threatening trade talks with the UK over Taiwan and banning Japanese scallops in retaliation for perceived Taiwan support. Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite wartime challenges, while domestic U.S. debates persist over AI in schools and the long-term impact of Trump’s federal workforce reductions.
