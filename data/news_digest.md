## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates global headlines with its aggressive moves in Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers and asserting control over the country's oil sales after the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. plans to lift some sanctions to maintain Venezuelan oil flows, but the operation has disrupted Caribbean airspace and drawn mixed reactions from Trump's base, some of whom now support intervention despite past opposition. Meanwhile, China faces economic and diplomatic challenges, from a record bond issuance amid weak demand to tensions with the UK over Taiwan. Japanese defense stocks surge as geopolitical risks rise, while Ukraine's businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, push forward despite ongoing war. Trump also targets Wall Street and defense contractors, proposing a $1.5 trillion military budget while cracking down on executive pay and stock buybacks.
