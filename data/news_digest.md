## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with Canada making a significant diplomatic push toward China. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to Beijing—the first by a Canadian leader in eight years—signals an effort to repair strained relations and expand trade, as Chinese state media presses Ottawa to lift tariffs. The trip underscores Canada’s search for new markets amid worsening U.S.-China relations, though Beijing’s sensitivity to sovereignty issues remains evident, as seen in its earlier threat to cancel UK trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan. Meanwhile, the looming expiration of Ozempic patents promises to reshape global pharmaceutical markets, with generic versions expected to drive down prices in major economies like China, India, and Brazil. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff demonstrate resilience, expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, while former U.S. President Trump’s aggressive pursuit of Venezuelan oil resources draws criticism for its outdated economic approach and potential to undermine American influence.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic resilience and emerging risks, with central banks and policymakers at the center of key developments. In the U.S., inflation holds steady at 2.7% as the Federal Reserve faces political pressure, with President Trump pushing for interest rate cuts and a controversial 10% cap on credit card rates—a move banks are fiercely resisting. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal strength in financials, as JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America beat estimates, though retail struggles persist with Saks Global filing for bankruptcy amid mounting debt. Internationally, China’s record trade surplus and regulatory tightening on margin financing highlight its balancing act between growth and market stability, while geopolitical tensions and tariff policies dominate business risks, according to the World Economic Forum. Commodities see volatility, with oil tanker rates spiking due to U.S.-Venezuela oil flows and silver retreating after Trump delays critical mineral tariffs. M&A activity heats up as Netflix reportedly shifts to an all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, signaling a potential media shakeup.

In healthcare, Amazon Pharmacy begins offering Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy weight-loss pill at discounted rates, reflecting the growing obesity drug market.
