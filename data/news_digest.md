## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic policy shifts dominate global headlines this week. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign sees 69 senior officials punished, reinforcing President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on graft amid economic challenges. Meanwhile, Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential tax relief on food as part of her election strategy, reflecting broader economic concerns in the region. The U.S. makes waves in international relations, with the Trump administration halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a move likely to strain diplomatic ties. Additionally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador, hinting at rising regional instability. On the economic front, Venezuela secures its first LPG export deal under Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage despite Trump’s push for Venezuelan oil access. Meanwhile, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S. relations with both nations grow increasingly fraught.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are navigating a mix of political pressure, corporate earnings, and shifting monetary policy as 2026 begins. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell facing a Justice Department subpoena and criticism from the Trump administration over interest rates. Former Fed officials, including Bill Dudley and Sheila Bair, warn that political interference risks undermining central bank independence, which could destabilize inflation control. Meanwhile, Wall Street is adapting to President Trump’s disruptive agenda, including a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates—a move banks fiercely oppose—and a potential ban on corporate ownership of single-family homes, which could impact real estate investors. In corporate news, major banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley reported mixed earnings, with wealth management outperforming amid broader economic uncertainty. Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong demand for its obesity drug Wegovy, while Saks’ bankruptcy filing after its Neiman Marcus acquisition sent shockwaves through retail. Elsewhere, Ecuador plans a return to global debt markets, and central banks are increasingly stockpiling gold as a hedge against dollar volatility. The crypto sector also saw turbulence, with Coinbase flexing its political muscle to block a Senate bill, while Bitcoin-linked strategies falter.
