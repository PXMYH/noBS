## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic political shifts dominate global headlines. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces mounting pressure amid a corruption scandal, prompting outreach to potential rivals as calls for elections grow. Meanwhile, China intensifies its anti-corruption drive, punishing 69 high-ranking officials last year, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi considers suspending food sales taxes ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution, a move aimed at bolstering her election campaign. The U.S. remains a focal point of diplomatic and military activity, with the FAA issuing warnings about military operations near Latin American airspace, while the Trump administration halts immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, citing welfare concerns. Venezuela also makes headlines, securing its first LPG export deal under Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage despite Trump's interest in the country's resources.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reacting to a mix of economic policy shifts, corporate earnings, and geopolitical developments. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve faces mounting pressure from the Trump administration, with former Fed officials warning that political interference could undermine central bank independence and risk inflation resurgence. Meanwhile, banks are pushing back against Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which has already rattled financial stocks. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: while HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk report strong results—boosted by loan growth and obesity drug sales, respectively—major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America fall short of expectations amid regulatory uncertainty. Overseas, the EU’s new ‘Made in Europe’ industrial policy signals a protectionist turn, while Japan’s stock rally faces risks from inflation and rising borrowing costs. In commodities, hedge funds slash bullish bets on silver, and central banks continue stockpiling gold as a hedge against dollar volatility. High-profile deals, such as Netflix’s potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets and York Space Systems’ $544 million IPO, highlight ongoing M&A activity, though Saks’ bankruptcy underscores retail sector struggles.

OpenAI announces plans to introduce advertisements in ChatGPT for U.S. users, marking a new revenue stream for the AI giant. Meanwhile, President Trump imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia's H200, citing national security concerns, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the impact. The SEC also approves new expiration options for 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, signaling a move toward daily expiries in single-stock options. Beyond tech, Taiwan secures a trade deal with the U.S., pledging more chip factories in America, while Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries for the first time since 2018.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S., announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi drawing shoppers away from traditional supermarkets by offering lower prices without sacrificing quality. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push consumers across income levels to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping habits. Aldi's strategy also highlights the shifting retail landscape, where efficiency and competitive pricing are becoming key drivers of customer loyalty. Industry analysts note that this expansion could further disrupt the market, forcing established grocers to adjust their pricing and promotions to retain customers.
