## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as China escalates its trade feud with Japan, threatening to cut off rare earth supplies—a critical vulnerability for Tokyo’s manufacturers. The dispute intensifies with Beijing imposing export controls on military-sensitive goods, while also banning Japanese scallops in retaliation for Japan’s perceived support of Taiwan. Meanwhile, the U.S. makes bold moves in Venezuela, with President Trump announcing the seizure of up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil worth $2.8 billion, a development that sends oil prices tumbling and prompts the FAA to close Caribbean airspace citing safety risks. The ouster of Nicolás Maduro sparks global debate, with China’s online discourse split between viewing it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan and warning of ideological overreach. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, while airlines scramble to adjust to flight cancellations amid the Venezuela crisis. In business, Ukrainian companies like vodka maker Nemiroff push forward despite wartime disruptions, and Warren Buffett’s departure from Berkshire Hathaway raises questions about the future of its $300 billion equity portfolio.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals as 2026 begins, with Asia-Pacific equities facing headwinds from geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating China-Japan trade dispute, which has boosted rare earth stocks amid new export curbs. Meanwhile, China’s equity rally gains momentum, with trading volumes hitting a four-month high and Goldman Sachs forecasting a 20% gain for Chinese stocks this year, supported by AI-driven growth and policy measures. Commodities are also in focus, as iron ore surges to its highest level since February on restocking and PBOC stimulus hopes, while palm oil rises on export optimism. In the U.S., the Fed’s December meeting minutes reveal a tight split over rate cuts, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggesting limited room for further easing. Corporate developments include Chevron’s potential bid for Lukoil’s international assets, Saks Global’s leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors, and SpaceX’s highly anticipated IPO, which could become the largest ever. Venezuela’s oil and bond markets are drawing intense speculation following Trump’s claims of renewed U.S. energy ties, though experts remain skeptical about the feasibility of such deals.

AI continues to reshape industries, with companies like Baidu advancing its AI chip unit toward a $2 billion Hong Kong IPO, while Nvidia partners with Chinese lidar maker Hesai to bolster autonomous driving technology. Meanwhile, the PC market faces headwinds as memory shortages, diverted to AI data centers, push prices higher. In corporate news, TSMC's record stock rally prompts Wall Street to raise price targets, reflecting bullish sentiment in semiconductors, while Vista Equity Partners doubles down on 'agentic AI' to transform enterprise software. Geopolitical strains add uncertainty, with China guarding its economic interests in Venezuela amid U.S. intervention, and global supply chains feeling the ripple effects. Elsewhere, BYD overtakes Tesla as the world's top EV seller, signaling China's dominance in electric vehicles, while traditional automakers like GM and Stellantis report mixed sales results. The intersection of AI, regulation, and global competition is defining 2026's economic narrative.
