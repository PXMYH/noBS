## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with the Trump administration making bold moves on multiple fronts. The U.S. indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Trump's push to assert control over Venezuela's oil resources draws skepticism, as analysts argue domestic production remains a more viable option for U.S. energy needs. Critics warn the move could undermine America's economic standing rather than bolster it. In Asia, Japan's finance minister signals potential currency intervention to stabilize the weakening yen, while Canada's former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair frayed Canada-China relations amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Domestically, the Pentagon faces controversy over plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, accusing it of being 'woke' and seeking greater government control. The entertainment world also sees a shakeup as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking a shift in leadership for the *Star Wars* franchise.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing a mix of optimism and caution as central banks and economic policies shape investor sentiment. Poland signals potential rate cuts in February amid low inflation, while China's record trade surplus fuels overseas investments and yuan appreciation. However, warnings of complacency emerge as credit markets hit their hottest levels since 2007. In corporate news, Saks Global files for bankruptcy after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus, while major U.S. banks report mixed earnings, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley outperforming. Meanwhile, China tightens regulations on high-frequency trading and sees record outflows from state-backed ETFs, reflecting efforts to cool its stock market rally. Commodities like silver and copper surge, benefiting Indian metal stocks but pressuring solar manufacturers.

## 💻 Technology

Global markets and tech sectors are experiencing significant shifts as geopolitical and economic forces collide. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reignites AI enthusiasm with a new U.S. trade deal, reducing tariffs on Taiwanese goods while pledging expanded chip manufacturing in America—a move mirrored by President Trump’s 25% tariff on Nvidia and AMD AI chips, citing national security. The tariffs, though narrowly applied, signal growing tensions over tech dominance, particularly as China clamps down on high-frequency trading and metals markets react to regulatory crackdowns. Meanwhile, Starlink’s satellite internet emerges as a lifeline for Iranian activists bypassing government blackouts, underscoring the role of private tech in circumventing state censorship. In corporate news, Boeing outperforms Airbus in deliveries for the first time since 2018, while JPMorgan faces pressure amid declining profits and leadership transition questions. The UK economy shows unexpected resilience with 0.3% growth in November, buoyed by recovery in sectors like automotive, though broader manufacturing trends in the U.S. remain sluggish despite Trump’s tariff-driven promises. Against this backdrop, labor disputes and unionization efforts—from Michigan autoworkers to New York bakery staff—highlight rising worker activism, while the looming prospect of mega-IPOs from SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic hints at a potential windfall for Silicon Valley in 2026.

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping.

The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push more consumers to prioritize affordability without sacrificing quality.
