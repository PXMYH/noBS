## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate headlines this week, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign sees 69 high-ranking officials punished, reinforcing President Xi Jinping's ongoing crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential economic shifts as she considers suspending food sales taxes—a move tied to her election campaign promises. In the U.S., the Trump administration tightens immigration policies by halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also making waves in corporate circles with Trump's personal investment in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds following their merger announcement. Geopolitical tensions rise as the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and seeking greater Defense Department control. These developments underscore a period of assertive policy shifts, economic maneuvering, and heightened global vigilance.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures as 2026 begins. President Donald Trump’s threats to sue JPMorgan over alleged debanking and his push for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates are rattling financial institutions, with banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo reporting weak earnings amid regulatory uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces scrutiny as newly released 2020 transcripts reveal Chair Jerome Powell’s past policy missteps, while a DOJ investigation into his actions adds to the tension. Central bank independence remains a flashpoint, with Fed officials warning that political interference could reignite inflation. Overseas, the Bank of Japan’s upcoming meeting has yen traders on edge, while the EU threatens to halt a U.S. trade deal over Trump’s tariff threats. Corporate highlights include Novo Nordisk’s 8% stock surge on strong Wegovy sales, Saudi Arabia’s aggressive tourism push under Vision 2030, and the collapse of Saks Global into bankruptcy after its ill-fated Neiman Marcus acquisition. Tech and energy sectors are also in focus, with Coinbase flexing its political muscle in Washington and Goldman Sachs exploring prediction markets as a new frontier.
