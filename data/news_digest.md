## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as the U.S. intensifies its focus on Venezuela, with President Trump pushing for control of the country's oil reserves amid political turmoil. The capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has sent shockwaves through international markets and geopolitical circles, prompting debates in China about potential parallels with Taiwan. Meanwhile, Russia's symbolic missile strike on Ukraine underscores ongoing regional instability, while Greenland firmly rejects Trump's annexation claims. In economic moves, Italy's Prime Minister Meloni signals openness to selling the government's stake in Banca Monte dei Paschi, and oil prices surge amid Iran's crackdown on protests. The U.S. also seizes two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil, tightening its blockade as Trump seeks to reshape Latin American energy dynamics.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as December’s jobs report reinforces the Federal Reserve’s wait-and-see stance on interest rates, with traders now pricing in almost no chance of a cut this month. The labor data, showing an unexpected drop in unemployment, underscores the central bank’s reluctance to ease policy without clearer signs of economic weakness. Meanwhile, corporate America faces mixed fortunes: General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, while luxury retailer Saks Global prepares for a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing as soon as Sunday. In dealmaking, Rio Tinto and Glencore restart merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining company, though Rio’s willingness to retain Glencore’s coal assets may complicate the deal. Geopolitical risks also loom, with oil markets on edge amid escalating tensions in Iran and President Trump’s push to leverage Venezuela’s crude reserves to drive prices down to $50 a barrel. Elsewhere, JPMorgan Chase takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking a shift in consumer banking, while BlackRock predicts a surge in retail crypto adoption this year.

## 💻 Technology

This week’s tech and business landscape is marked by high-stakes corporate maneuvering, AI controversies, and shifting market dynamics. In the tech sector, Warner Bros. Discovery’s board rebuffs Paramount’s $108 billion hostile takeover bid, doubling down on its Netflix partnership as the superior strategic path. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok faces backlash for generating sexualized images of real people, prompting X to restrict image generation to paid subscribers amid regulatory scrutiny. The AI boom continues to reshape industries, with Vista Equity Partners touting its 'agentic factory' as a transformative approach to enterprise AI adoption, while JPMorgan’s asset management arm ditches controversial proxy advisors in favor of AI-driven analysis for shareholder votes. In automotive news, Ford joins the race for eyes-off driving technology, aiming to launch a $30,000 EV with advanced autonomous features by 2028, while GM and Lucid report mixed results—GM takes a $7.1 billion hit from EV pullbacks and China restructuring, while Lucid posts a 55% delivery increase. Beyond tech, economic signals remain mixed: U.S. job growth slows to 50,000 in December, capping the weakest hiring year since the pandemic, though unemployment dips to 4.4%. Geopolitical tensions flare as China investigates Meta’s acquisition of AI startup Manus over compliance concerns, and Venezuela’s potential Bitcoin holdings draw speculation amid U.S. sanctions. The week also sees Alaska Airlines place its largest-ever order for 110 Boeing jets, signaling confidence in post-merger expansion, while the restaurant industry grapples with new federal nutrition guidelines that could benefit fast-casual chains like Chipotle.
