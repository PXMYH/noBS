## 🌍 World & Politics

President Trump is making bold moves on multiple fronts, both domestically and internationally. In a bid to accelerate defense production, he seeks new powers to penalize underperforming weapons manufacturers, reflecting his administration's push to strengthen military readiness. Meanwhile, his aggressive stance in Latin America—particularly in Venezuela—is drawing scrutiny, as the U.S. captures President Nicolás Maduro and outlines plans to revive the country’s oil sector. However, major oil companies remain hesitant due to political and financial risks, with executives meeting Trump to discuss concerns. The situation in Venezuela is further complicated by logistical challenges, as seen in a drifting tanker near the Caribbean, and legal disputes over prediction markets betting on U.S. intervention. Trump’s geopolitical ambitions extend to Greenland, where his annexation remarks are met with fierce resistance from local leaders, underscoring tensions over Arctic sovereignty. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s economic strain deepens as its state railway suspends bond payments amid the ongoing war with Russia, while businesses like vodka exporter Nemiroff struggle to maintain exports despite bombardment. On the energy front, oil prices rise for a third consecutive week as Iran’s crackdown on protests intensifies, with Trump warning of repercussions. Diplomatic friction also surfaces as China threatens to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s Taiwan visit, highlighting Beijing’s sensitivity to territorial issues. Domestically, Trump calls on Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes, aiming to ease housing market pressures.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with mixed signals as strong jobs data dampened hopes for an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut, with traders now pricing in almost no chance of a January reduction. The Fed's cautious stance is reinforced by a resilient labor market, though concerns linger about future economic softness. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains brisk: Rio Tinto and Glencore restarted merger talks that could create the world's largest mining giant, while Walmart-backed fintech OnePay hit a $4 billion valuation. The IPO market shows signs of life, with EquipmentShare and Motive preparing listings and Aktis Oncology surging 27% in its debut. Geopolitical risks are rising, with oil markets on edge over Iran protests and Trump's aggressive push to revive Venezuela's oil sector, aiming to slash crude prices to $50 a barrel. However, Wall Street largely shrugged off geopolitical tensions, sending stocks to record highs despite trade policy uncertainties.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape opens 2026 with a mix of AI-driven expansion and economic caution. Meta makes a bold energy play, signing multi-gigawatt nuclear deals to power its AI data centers, while also facing regulatory scrutiny in China over its acquisition of AI startup Manus. Meanwhile, Apple shares extend their longest losing streak since 1991, reflecting broader market jitters as U.S. job growth hits a five-year low, with employers adding just 50,000 jobs in December. The EV sector shows signs of strain, as GM announces $7.1 billion in charges tied to its electric vehicle pullback and China restructuring, while Stellantis scraps its Jeep and Chrysler plug-in hybrid models amid slowing demand. In aviation, Alaska Airlines places its largest-ever order for 110 Boeing jets, signaling confidence in post-pandemic travel recovery. Regulatory and legal challenges loom, with Elon Musk’s Grok AI facing backlash over generating sexualized images of real people, and the Supreme Court weighing the fate of Trump’s tariff policies. Against this backdrop, nuclear energy sees renewed optimism, with companies like Kairos Power advancing new reactor designs, though their long-term viability remains uncertain.
