## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with the U.S. and China at the center of global power struggles. President Trump's keynote at the World Economic Forum signals a retreat from liberal democratic leadership, ceding influence to China, which now positions itself as a dominant force in the global economy. Meanwhile, Trump's aggressive trade rhetoric persists, with threats of a new trade war looming even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority. The administration's stance on Venezuela remains contradictory, as sanctions complicate U.S. investment efforts while locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies like USDT to shield themselves from economic instability. Domestically, protests erupt in Minnesota over ICE operations, with organizers demanding the agency's removal from the state amid allegations of constitutional violations. In Europe, French President Macron draws unexpected attention at Davos—not for policy, but for his sunglasses, which became a viral distraction from pressing geopolitical discussions. Meanwhile, the Pentagon faces pushback over attempts to control the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, accused of being 'woke,' as lawmakers and the outlet's leaders fight to preserve its independence.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are experiencing significant volatility amid geopolitical tensions and central bank actions. The yen surged sharply on speculation of Japanese intervention, while the dollar faced its worst week since May due to unpredictable U.S. policymaking. Commodities saw dramatic moves, with silver topping $100 an ounce and copper rallying above $13,000 a ton, driven by safe-haven demand and a weaker dollar. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One acquiring fintech Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX preparing for a potential blockbuster IPO. Economic concerns persist as CEOs warn of jittery U.S. consumers and sticky inflation, while the Federal Reserve's independence faces scrutiny amid political pressure. In earnings, Procter & Gamble beat estimates but reported weaker revenue, reflecting broader consumer caution.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire. The league announces it will host a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort, marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in the past four years. This partnership underscores LIV Golf’s strategy of aligning with high-profile venues and figures, despite ongoing political and ethical debates surrounding its Saudi funding. The move also highlights the league’s efforts to solidify its presence in the U.S. golf market, even as traditional tours like the PGA maintain a competitive stance. Meanwhile, the collaboration raises questions about the intersection of sports, politics, and business, as LIV Golf’s expansion remains a polarizing topic in the golf world.
