## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The move, led by President Trump, has sent shockwaves through global markets, particularly oil and defense sectors, as analysts assess the implications for Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and U.S. energy strategy. The intervention has also sparked debate in China, where some view it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others caution against ideological overreach. Meanwhile, Beijing faces uncertainty over its oil investments in Venezuela, with billions in loans now in question. In Europe, France grapples with a looming budget deficit crisis after failing to pass a 2026 budget, while the UK navigates tense relations with China following a minister’s visit to Taiwan, which nearly derailed trade talks. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s war continues to disrupt global oil markets, with traders weighing the impact of potential peace deals, while businesses in Ukraine adapt to ongoing conflict by expanding exports despite logistical challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with a mix of geopolitical shifts, corporate maneuvering, and economic uncertainty. The U.S. stock market edges closer to record highs as investors weigh Federal Reserve policy, with Treasury yields signaling expectations of rate cuts amid a deep divide among officials over inflation and unemployment risks. The energy sector surges 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela’s political upheaval, as oil services giant Weatherford calls the country a 'massive opportunity' following Nicolás Maduro’s ouster, while the U.S. grapples with the fate of Venezuela’s $1.4 billion in gold reserves held in the Bank of England. Meanwhile, dealmaking accelerates: private equity firm Hg acquires financial software maker OneStream in a $6.4 billion takeover, and Warner Bros. Discovery faces a heated takeover battle with Paramount and potential interest from Netflix. Corporate struggles also dominate, with Saks Global’s CEO stepping down as the luxury retailer teeters toward bankruptcy, and Berkshire Hathaway entering a new era under Greg Abel after Warren Buffett’s exit. Commodities see volatility, with cotton hitting an eight-week high and China restricting silver exports, while Zambia’s kwacha rallies on currency controls. The Fed’s cautious stance and lingering AI-driven market optimism set the tone for a year where geopolitical risks and monetary policy remain pivotal.
