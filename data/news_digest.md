## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures as 2026 begins. President Trump’s threats to sue JPMorgan Chase over alleged debanking and his push for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates are rattling financial institutions, with banks and lobbyists resisting the latter. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces scrutiny as newly released 2020 transcripts reveal Chair Jerome Powell’s regretted rate guidance, while a DOJ criminal investigation into Powell raises concerns about central bank independence. On the corporate front, earnings season kicks off with mixed results: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs beat estimates, but Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo fall short amid regulatory uncertainty. Novo Nordisk surges 8% on strong Wegovy sales, while Stellantis focuses on execution amid U.S. sales declines. Geopolitically, Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 tourism push and Venezuela’s potential economic revival under Trump’s policies are drawing attention, though challenges remain. The EU’s ‘Made in Europe’ law signals a shift toward protectionism, while central banks globally stockpile gold amid dollar skepticism.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocer Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S., announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores this year as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The move underscores the intensifying competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The company's aggressive growth strategy reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push more consumers to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping habits. Aldi's expansion could further disrupt traditional grocery chains, forcing them to adapt to shifting consumer preferences or risk losing ground in a highly competitive market.
