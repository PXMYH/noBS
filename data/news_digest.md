## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as the Trump administration makes bold moves in Venezuela and immigration policy. The U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has sent shockwaves through global oil markets, though prices remain stable for now. Analysts question whether major oil companies will rush to invest in Venezuela, with many preferring domestic U.S. production. Meanwhile, Trump’s self-declared role as acting president of Venezuela raises concerns about economic overreach, with critics warning his approach could weaken U.S. economic influence. On the immigration front, the State Department halts visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. Internationally, Canada seeks to mend ties with China as former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to explore new trade opportunities amid strained U.S.-China relations.
