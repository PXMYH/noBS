## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets and economic indicators present a mixed picture as 2026 begins, with US stocks extending losses amid uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut trajectory. Despite steady inflation at 2.7% in December and stronger-than-expected retail sales, investors remain cautious as geopolitical risks and Fed policy debates weigh on sentiment. The Supreme Court’s delay in ruling on Trump’s tariffs adds to the uncertainty, while Fed officials like Governor Stephen Miran cite deregulation as a reason for potential rate cuts later in the year. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal resilience in banking, with JPMorgan and Bank of America beating estimates, though banks are bracing for potential disruptions from Trump’s proposed credit card interest rate caps. In commodities, metals surge to record highs, with gold, silver, and copper rallying as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets. The luxury retail sector faces a reckoning as Saks Global, owner of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, files for bankruptcy, owing hundreds of millions to brands like Chanel and LVMH. On the global stage, China’s record $1.19 trillion trade surplus underscores its export dominance, while Venezuela’s oil output is poised for a 50% rebound over the next decade following political shifts. M&A activity remains robust, with Netflix reportedly preparing an all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery and private equity firms like Carlyle eyeing stakes in energy projects. Central bank independence emerges as a flashpoint, with global bankers rallying behind Fed Chair Jerome Powell amid political pressure from the Trump administration.

Discovery's streaming business to an all-cash deal, signaling continued consolidation in the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's rare intervention to support South Korea's weakening won underscores global currency concerns. OPEC's projection of steady oil demand growth into 2027 contrasts with domestic economic pressures, as rising food prices and housing affordability dominate U.S. policy debates.
