## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector drawing both skepticism and resistance. Despite Trump’s efforts to rally U.S. oil executives to invest in Venezuela, many remain hesitant due to political instability and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, oil prices surge to a one-month high as protests in Iran raise fears of supply disruptions, compounding pressure on U.S. shale producers already grappling with a global glut. In Latin America, Bolivia’s President Rodrigo Paz secures a critical deal to phase out fuel subsidies, a key test of his fiscal reforms. Elsewhere, China’s strategic dominance in Latin America looms large as it monitors Trump’s moves, while diplomatic friction flares between Beijing and London after a UK minister’s Taiwan visit nearly derailed trade talks. The war in Ukraine continues to disrupt businesses, though some, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on with expansion plans despite ongoing attacks.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures, with the U.S. Federal Reserve at the center of controversy. A Justice Department criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, widely seen as an attempt to pressure the central bank into cutting interest rates, has sparked backlash from former Fed officials and market volatility. While U.S. stocks edged to record highs, emerging markets gained traction as investors revived the 'Sell America' trade amid concerns over Fed independence. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Teneo expanding through acquisitions and Medline's strong IPO debut. In Asia, the Philippine peso hit record lows, while New Zealand's business confidence surged on rate cuts. China's economic challenges persist, with tech sectors failing to offset real estate woes, though Europe and China took steps to ease EV trade tensions. Corporate earnings and strategic moves, such as Pfizer's focus on weight-loss drugs and Paramount's opposition to Warner Bros' Netflix deal, highlight ongoing business adaptation.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi, the discount grocery chain, is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. with plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026. The move underscores the intensifying competition in the grocery sector as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping. Aldi's aggressive growth strategy reflects broader shifts in consumer behavior, with shoppers across income levels prioritizing value amid economic uncertainty. The expansion also signals a challenge to traditional supermarkets, which are losing market share to discount retailers offering lower prices without sacrificing quality. Industry analysts note that Aldi's focus on efficiency and private-label products continues to resonate with cost-sensitive customers, further solidifying its position in the competitive retail landscape.
