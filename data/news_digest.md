## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with the Trump administration pushing to lift sanctions and secure Venezuelan oil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signals potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales, while major traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious amid political uncertainty, and Trump’s $100 billion investment plan faces skepticism. The shift in Venezuela also eases tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from reduced border-conflict risks. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipment to Cuba heightens US-Cuba tensions, underscoring regional power struggles. Elsewhere, Greenland rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and China monitors US actions in Latin America while asserting its own influence. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases. Democratic lawmakers, however, demand an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, reflecting ongoing political friction.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and shifting economic trends. Oil prices remain volatile, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia cutting crude prices for Asian buyers, while Venezuela’s oil industry becomes a focal point after President Trump’s aggressive takeover plans. Meanwhile, U.S. inflation shows signs of stabilizing, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s measured approach to rate cuts, though labor market strength keeps further easing in check. Corporate activity is brisk, with Rio Tinto and Glencore reviving merger talks in a potential $260 billion mining deal, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss amid scaled-back EV ambitions. Gold investors stay bullish after a record 2025 rally, and defense stocks surge as global tensions persist. In retail, Saks Global faces potential bankruptcy, and GameStop grants CEO Ryan Cohen performance-based options tied to a $100 billion valuation target. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though affordability concerns linger as Trump pushes policies targeting institutional homebuyers and mortgage bond purchases.
