## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Ukraine faces a massive drone and missile attack on Kyiv, even as US, Russian, and Ukrainian representatives continue peace talks in the UAE. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive economic policies take center stage, with threats of new tariffs on European wine and a potential trade war, while his administration’s stance at the World Economic Forum signals a retreat from liberal democratic leadership, ceding influence to China. Domestic unrest in the US sees tens of thousands of Minnesotans protesting ICE operations, while Venezuela remains a flashpoint as Trump pushes for US investment despite lingering sanctions, and locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT to hedge against economic instability. Elsewhere, France’s Macron draws unexpected attention at Davos for his sunglasses, overshadowing broader geopolitical discussions, while the Pentagon’s criticism of the *Stars and Stripes* military newspaper sparks debates over press freedom and independence.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets experienced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, with silver surging past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high as traders sought safe-haven assets. The dollar suffered its worst week since May amid concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, while Japan’s bond market chaos and potential yen intervention added to the uncertainty. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s reported $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO. The Fed’s independence faced scrutiny as Trump’s legal battle with JPMorgan and pressure on monetary policy raised questions about central bank autonomy. Emerging markets and commodities benefited from diversification flows, though private credit risks and sticky inflation kept investors on edge.

The tech sector is buzzing with major developments, led by Tesla's bold move to deploy fully autonomous robotaxis in Austin without safety drivers, marking a significant leap in self-driving technology. Meanwhile, Apple signals a potential leadership transition by expanding hardware chief John Ternus' role to include design, positioning him as a top contender to succeed CEO Tim Cook. In AI, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled chip sales amid geopolitical tensions, while the IMF warns of an AI 'tsunami' disrupting labor markets, with young workers facing the brunt of job displacement. Regulatory shifts are also shaping the industry, as TikTok updates its U.S. terms following a corporate restructuring to distance itself from its Chinese parent company, and the FCC cracks down on late-night TV shows hosting political candidates. Beyond tech, global tensions persist, with Trump's unpredictable policies keeping allies on edge, while economic uncertainties loom over housing markets and trade.
