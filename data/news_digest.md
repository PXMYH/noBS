## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, emphasizes that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding Ukraine negotiations, while also addressing President Trump’s controversial threats to seize Greenland and his meeting with Zelenskiy. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive trade policies—including renewed tariff threats on European wine and a potential new trade war—spark concerns as courts weigh limiting his authority. His push for U.S. investment in Venezuela clashes with lingering sanctions, complicating business prospects in the crisis-stricken nation. Domestically, tens of thousands of Minnesotans stage a strike to protest ICE’s expanded operations, demanding the agency’s removal from the state. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins as a hedge against government volatility, highlighting the broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in unstable regimes. The Pentagon’s attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticized as 'woke,' faces pushback from Congress, underscoring ongoing debates over media independence within the U.S. military.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets experienced significant volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts dominated headlines. The S&P 500 posted its first two-week loss since June, driven by uncertainty over U.S. trade policy after President Trump abruptly reversed course on tariffs targeting Europe, sparking a synchronized selloff before a partial rebound. Safe-haven assets surged, with silver topping $100 an ounce for the first time and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high amid investor anxiety over Greenland and broader economic instability. Meanwhile, the dollar suffered its worst week since May as traders reacted to unpredictable U.S. policymaking, while speculation grew that Japan may intervene in currency markets to stabilize the yen. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One acquiring fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX reportedly preparing for a blockbuster IPO valued at $800 billion. However, cracks in private credit markets emerged as BlackRock marked down a debt fund by 19%, signaling rising pressure in the sector. The Fed’s delayed inflation data showed sticky price growth, keeping monetary policy in focus, while the Supreme Court expressed unease over threats to central bank independence amid Trump’s ongoing criticism.
