## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales. President Trump is pushing oil executives to invest in Venezuela, though many remain hesitant due to political uncertainty. Meanwhile, Guyana stands to benefit from reduced border tensions, while Mexico's oil shipments to Cuba heighten US-Cuba tensions. In other developments, Trump seeks expanded powers to pressure defense contractors over delays, and China watches US actions in Latin America closely, having already established deep economic ties in the region. Greenland's labor leader rejects Trump's annexation claims, and Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Additionally, Ukraine's Nemiroff vodka maker continues exports despite wartime challenges, and China previously threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as inflation trends show signs of stabilization, though risks linger. U.S. inflation remains subdued, reinforcing expectations of gradual Fed rate cuts, while Egypt's steady inflation may pave the way for further monetary easing. However, corporate bond markets face pressure, with a growing number of investment-grade issuers teetering on the brink of junk status. In equities, defense stocks surge amid geopolitical tensions, while gold investors remain bullish after a record 2025 rally. Meanwhile, BlackRock predicts continued strength in AI-driven stocks but advises targeted bets. Major M&A activity is underway, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks that could create the world's largest mining firm. President Trump's aggressive energy policies dominate headlines, as he pushes for U.S. control of Venezuela's oil reserves—a move met with skepticism from oil executives. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though Trump's mortgage bond initiative sparks debate over financial risks. Elsewhere, India's 7.4% GDP growth draws scrutiny, and China promotes its duty-free Hainan island amid trade surplus tensions.
