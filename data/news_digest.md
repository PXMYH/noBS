## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intensifies its focus on Venezuela, with President Trump pushing for control over the country's oil reserves amid political turmoil. The U.S. has seized two tankers linked to Venezuelan oil, escalating a blockade, while major oil executives express caution over investing in the region. Meanwhile, China watches closely, as its long-standing economic ties with Venezuela face uncertainty following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. In Europe, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni signals openness to selling the government's remaining stake in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, though without urgency. Russia's missile strike on Ukraine's Lviv, deemed more symbolic than destructive, underscores ongoing regional tensions. Additionally, Greenland's labor union leader firmly rejects Trump's annexation claims, emphasizing the territory's sovereignty.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reacting to shifting central bank policies and geopolitical developments, with the Federal Reserve signaling caution on rate cuts after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report dampened expectations for easing. The European Central Bank's Philip Lane suggests the euro may gain prominence as investors reconsider dollar holdings amid President Trump's economic policies, which include a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase order to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lower borrowing costs. Meanwhile, corporate maneuvers dominate headlines, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks that could create the world's largest mining company, and General Motors reporting a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions. Venezuela remains a focal point as Trump outlines plans to leverage its oil reserves to drive down U.S. energy prices, while investors speculate on the country's debt and potential asset recoveries. In other notable moves, JPMorgan Chase takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announces its shutdown after decades of financial struggles.
