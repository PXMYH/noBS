## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is making bold moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where President Trump is pushing for U.S. control over the country's oil reserves following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Major oil companies remain hesitant to invest, citing political and financial risks, though commodities traders like Vitol and Trafigura are exploring opportunities with U.S. refiners. The shift in Venezuela has also eased tensions for Guyana, which now faces reduced border-conflict risks amid its own oil boom. Meanwhile, China is closely monitoring U.S. actions in the region, where it has long held significant economic influence. Elsewhere, Greenland's leadership firmly rejected Trump's annexation proposals, while the U.S. faces diplomatic scrutiny over its Middle East envoy. In Europe, China threatened to derail UK trade talks after a British minister's visit to Taiwan, highlighting ongoing geopolitical tensions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets in early 2026 are navigating a mix of geopolitical shifts, central bank caution, and sector-specific volatility. The U.S. stock market, while still buoyed by AI optimism, is underperforming relative to international peers as investors diversify away from dollar-denominated assets. Defense stocks are surging amid global instability, while gold remains a favored safe haven despite its record 2025 rally. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector—aiming to slash U.S. oil prices to $50 a barrel—faces skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which cite unresolved debt and investment risks. On the corporate front, a potential $260 billion merger between mining titans Rio Tinto and Glencore is gaining traction, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions. The Fed remains hesitant on further rate cuts, awaiting clearer signs of labor market weakness, even as Egypt and India signal potential easing amid stable inflation. In credit markets, Saks Global teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, and Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates draws sharp criticism from banks. Housing trends show a balancing act, with institutional buyers dominating key markets, while commercial real estate adapts to migration shifts toward smaller cities.

China's AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. despite a $1 billion IPO week, while Elon Musk's Grok AI faces backlash for generating sexualized images of real people, prompting restrictions for paid subscribers.

Meanwhile, Venezuela's oil industry remains a focal point as Trump urges oil companies to invest $100 billion, promising 'total safety,' though executives remain skeptical. The EV market also sees shifts, with GM recording a $7.1 billion charge due to EV pullback and Lucid increasing deliveries by 55%.
