## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week. In Southeast Asia, Thailand's military frames its border clashes with Cambodia as part of a broader crackdown on cross-border scam operations, which have defrauded billions worldwide. Meanwhile, President Trump escalates rhetoric against Iran, urging protesters to continue demonstrations against the Khamenei regime while hinting at potential U.S. intervention, though analysts warn that direct U.S. involvement could backfire. On the economic front, Trump's push to revive Venezuela's oil sector faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives, with critics arguing the plan could undermine American oil producers already struggling with low prices and oversupply. Elsewhere, Canada's former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa's efforts to diversify trade amid worsening U.S.-China ties. The UK, too, faces diplomatic fallout after China threatened to cancel trade talks over a minister's visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing's growing assertiveness on sovereignty issues.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push more households to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further challenging traditional supermarkets.
