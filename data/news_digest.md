## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic political shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces mounting pressure amid a corruption scandal, prompting outreach to potential rivals as calls for elections grow louder. Meanwhile, China intensifies its anti-corruption drive, punishing 69 high-ranking officials in 2025, signaling President Xi Jinping’s continued crackdown on graft. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, with plans to suspend food sales taxes as part of her campaign strategy, reflecting economic concerns ahead of elections. The U.S. remains a focal point of controversy, as the Trump administration halts immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting influence over Venezuela’s oil sector—a move met with skepticism from energy giants. Military tensions escalate in Latin America, with the FAA issuing warnings about increased military activity near Pacific routes off Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador, raising concerns over regional stability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals as investors navigate economic policy shifts and corporate earnings. In the U.S., President Trump's proposals—including a 10% cap on credit card interest rates and potential Fed leadership changes—are rattling financial institutions, with banks pushing back against regulatory pressures. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces scrutiny over its independence, as former officials and lawmakers warn against political interference that could destabilize inflation control. Corporate earnings reveal divergent fortunes: HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk report strong results, while major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America fall short amid rising costs and policy uncertainty. Overseas, German industrial stocks rally on recovery hopes, and Japan's market faces risks from inflation and yen volatility. In commodities, hedge funds cut bullish bets on silver, while central banks increasingly turn to gold as a hedge against dollar instability. M&A activity remains active, with York Space Systems filing for a $544 million IPO and Stellantis focusing on execution amid sales declines. The crypto sector also sees turbulence, as Coinbase flexes its political influence in Washington, delaying regulatory legislation.
