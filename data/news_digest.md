## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with a bold intervention in Venezuela, seizing control of the country’s oil sales and capturing President Nicolás Maduro in a move that reshapes regional geopolitics. The U.S. has intensified its blockade, seizing two oil tankers—including a Russian-flagged vessel—and securing an agreement to lift some sanctions in exchange for continued Venezuelan crude exports. The operation has sparked global reactions, with China debating its implications for Taiwan and investors like Michael Burry positioning for shifts in energy markets. Meanwhile, Trump’s domestic agenda includes cracking down on defense contractors over executive pay and stock buybacks while pushing Congress to block Wall Street from purchasing single-family homes. Elsewhere, tensions persist as China threatens to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, and Ukrainian businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, adapt to wartime challenges by expanding exports despite ongoing conflict.

Fox's free streaming service Tubi is making waves in the competitive streaming landscape, surpassing major players like Peacock and HBO Max in viewership. According to Nielsen's November Gauge report, Tubi secured a larger share of streaming minutes, marking a significant milestone for the ad-supported platform. This achievement highlights the growing appeal of free, ad-supported streaming options amid rising subscription costs and consumer fatigue with multiple paid services. Tubi's success underscores a shifting trend in viewer preferences, as audiences increasingly turn to cost-effective alternatives without sacrificing content variety.
