## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week's headlines, with China emerging as a central player in multiple disputes. Beijing threatened to derail UK trade talks in June after a British minister's visit to Taiwan, underscoring its sensitivity over the island's status. Meanwhile, Canada's former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair strained relations and explore new trade opportunities, signaling Ottawa's push to diversify markets amid worsening U.S.-China ties. In the U.S., the Trump administration faces criticism for its approach to Venezuela, with analysts warning that resource-focused policies could undermine long-term American economic strength. Domestically, concerns over press freedom arise as applicants for military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* undergo 'loyalty tests' tied to administration priorities, raising questions about editorial independence. Against this backdrop, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, highlighting the country's determination to sustain its economy amid war.
