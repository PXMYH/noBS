## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend dominates global headlines, with President Trump signaling plans to 'run' Venezuela ahead of eventual elections. The move triggers immediate geopolitical and economic ripple effects: energy traders like Trafigura engage in talks with Washington to resume Venezuelan oil purchases, while China faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Caracas. Beijing also escalates tensions with Japan, imposing military export controls after Tokyo’s remarks on Taiwan, further straining regional relations. Meanwhile, domestic U.S. policies under Trump continue to reshape institutions, with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolving after federal funding cuts. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on despite wartime disruptions, underscoring resilience amid conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and corporate shifts. German inflation slows sharply to 2%, reinforcing expectations that the European Central Bank will hold rates steady, while emerging market bonds rally as risk premiums over Treasuries hit a 13-year low. In the U.S., the Fed remains divided over further rate cuts, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggesting limited room for easing. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions flare as President Trump’s intervention in Venezuela—including proposals to subsidize oil investments—lifts energy stocks but raises concerns about broader economic fallout. Commodities are in focus, with copper surging to record highs amid tight supplies, while China’s move to restrict silver exports fuels a retail-driven rally in the metal. Corporate activity is brisk: BlueScope Steel soars on an $8.8 billion takeover bid, InPost jumps 20% after a buyout offer, and Saks Global faces bankruptcy as its CEO steps down. Tech giants like Nvidia face growing skepticism over sky-high valuations, while SpaceX’s impending IPO draws intense investor interest. The year begins with a bifurcated market, as regional stocks gain traction and luxury retailers struggle under heavy debt burdens.
