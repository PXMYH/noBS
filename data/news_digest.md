## 🌍 World & Politics

President Donald Trump dominates headlines with a series of bold domestic and foreign policy moves ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On the economic front, he proposes a 10% cap on credit card interest rates and urges Congress to block Wall Street from purchasing single-family homes, aiming to ease financial burdens on Americans. His focus on Latin America intensifies as he pushes for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s oil sector following the ousting of Nicolás Maduro, though major oil executives remain hesitant due to political and financial risks. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipment to Cuba escalates tensions with the U.S., highlighting the region’s shifting alliances. Internationally, Trump’s suggestion of annexing Greenland draws sharp rebuke from local leaders, while China watches his Latin America strategy closely, having already established deep economic ties in the region. Elsewhere, diplomatic strains persist as China threatens to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, and Ukrainian businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on with exports despite ongoing war challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with mixed signals as investors diversify away from U.S. assets despite the S&P 500's 16% AI-driven rally in 2025. Defense stocks surge amid geopolitical tensions, while gold remains a favored safe haven after last year's record rally. The Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts, awaiting clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as Egypt's steady inflation opens the door for potential easing. Corporate America faces headwinds, with General Motors posting a $7.1 billion loss due to scaled-back EV ambitions and Volkswagen struggling under tariffs. Meanwhile, a potential $260 billion merger between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore reignites, while Trump's aggressive push to unlock Venezuela's oil reserves draws skepticism from energy executives. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though institutional buyers remain a flashpoint, and JPMorgan's takeover of the Apple Card marks Goldman Sachs' retreat from consumer banking.
