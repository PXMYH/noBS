## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate headlines as U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive policies reshape international relations. Trump's renewed focus on Greenland sparks financial instability, weakening the Danish krone to a six-year low, while his hardline immigration stance results in the U.S. experiencing net negative migration for the first time in half a century. Meanwhile, escalating rhetoric against Iran drives oil prices to a two-month high, amplifying concerns over potential supply disruptions. In Latin America, Colombia races to secure bond financing ahead of critical elections, while Trump's push to exploit Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives and critics who warn of economic backlash. Diplomatic strains persist as China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit, even as Beijing offers Canada a trade olive branch—easing canola restrictions in exchange for relaxed EV tariffs. Against this backdrop, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war challenges, underscoring the enduring human cost of conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are navigating a tense standoff between the Federal Reserve and the Trump administration, as a Justice Department criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell sparks global concern over central bank independence. Despite steady inflation at 2.7% in December, traders remain cautious, with stocks fluctuating amid mixed earnings reports—JPMorgan Chase beat expectations but warned of risks from a proposed 10% credit card rate cap, which banks argue could disrupt lending. Meanwhile, hedge funds posted their best returns since 2009, and Africa’s oil producers saw bond gains as Brent crude rose on geopolitical tensions. Corporate highlights include Delta’s strong travel demand outlook and BNY Mellon’s raised profit targets, while global central banks rally behind Powell, underscoring the high stakes of political pressure on monetary policy.
