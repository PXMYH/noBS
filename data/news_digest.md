## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate the global stage as President Trump pushes an aggressive $100 billion plan to revive Venezuela’s oil sector, despite skepticism from major energy firms wary of political instability and legal risks. The move, seen as a bid to counter China’s deepening influence in Latin America, faces resistance from oil executives and analysts who question its feasibility amid a global supply glut and low prices. Meanwhile, China’s strategic foothold in the region remains strong, with Beijing closely monitoring U.S. actions while asserting its economic leverage elsewhere, including threats to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit. In Europe, Lufthansa’s decision to resume flights to Iran—despite deadly protests and travel warnings—highlights the complex balance between commerce and geopolitical risk. Back in the U.S., Trump’s domestic agenda includes pressuring defense contractors to accelerate weapons production and urging Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes, reflecting his populist economic priorities. Against this backdrop, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff vodka expand exports despite ongoing war, underscoring the enduring human drive to adapt amid conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are on edge as the U.S. Justice Department launches a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, escalating tensions between the Trump administration and the central bank. The probe, tied to Powell’s congressional testimony on Fed headquarters renovations, has reignited fears over the Fed’s independence, triggering a sell-off in U.S. stocks and bonds while sending gold and silver to record highs. Investors are diversifying away from American assets, with Citigroup predicting further gains in global equities as confidence in U.S. markets wavers. Meanwhile, geopolitical and trade dynamics are reshaping global business, as Europe and China move to resolve their electric vehicle dispute through voluntary import limits, and the U.S. trade deficit hits its lowest level since 2009 amid Trump’s tariff policies. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture, with General Motors posting a $7.1 billion loss due to scaled-back EV ambitions, while India’s low inflation leaves room for potential rate cuts. In other developments, Standard Chartered is expanding into crypto prime brokerage, and Middle East venture capital funding surges to record highs, defying global trends.
