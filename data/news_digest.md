## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, as President Donald Trump’s bold move to assert control over Venezuela sends shockwaves through geopolitical and financial markets. Maduro’s ouster raises questions about Venezuela’s future governance, with uncertainty lingering over who will lead the oil-rich nation. The event triggers immediate market reactions, including a slump in Canadian heavy crude prices and volatility in Colombia’s bonds amid rising tensions between Trump and Colombian President Petro. Meanwhile, China faces a turning point in its oil dealings with Venezuela, as billions in loans hang in the balance. Beyond Venezuela, diplomatic strains persist elsewhere: China threatened to cancel UK trade talks after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, while Japan’s scallop exports become collateral in Beijing’s broader pressure campaign over Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff push forward despite wartime disruptions, reflecting resilience amid ongoing conflict. The broader implications of Trump’s aggressive foreign policy and China’s strategic economic maneuvers underscore a shifting global order.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with resilience, shrugging off geopolitical tensions after Venezuela's leadership upheaval. US stocks rallied, led by tech and energy sectors, while gold and oil prices fluctuated amid shifting risk sentiment. The S&P 500's energy sector surged 2.7% as investors bet on Venezuela's oil potential, though broader market gains reflected optimism about economic growth. Meanwhile, Treasury yields dipped on weak manufacturing data, fueling expectations of further Fed rate cuts. Corporate activity remained brisk, with BlueScope Steel shares soaring on an $8.8 billion takeover bid and Brazilian fintech PicPay filing for a US IPO. However, challenges loomed as Saks Global faced bankruptcy rumors and the Fed grappled with internal divisions over inflation versus unemployment risks. The week also saw a $37 billion high-grade bond issuance rush, signaling strong corporate borrowing appetite.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape kicks off 2026 with major shifts in AI, automotive, and global markets. China's Kuaishou sees its stock surge 84% after a rapid pivot to AI video generation, underscoring the sector's explosive growth, while Beijing tightens regulations on AI chatbots to curb harmful content. In the EV race, BYD dethrones Tesla as the world's top electric car seller after Tesla's deliveries slumped amid U.S. subsidy cuts, reflecting a broader slowdown in China's once-booming EV market. Meanwhile, traditional automakers like GM and Stellantis report mixed results, with GM posting a 5.5% U.S. sales gain and Stellantis reviving its gas-guzzling Ram TRX truck amid deregulation. Geopolitical tensions flare as the U.S. captures Venezuela's President Maduro, disrupting oil markets and travel, while Chevron's long-term bets in the country face new uncertainties. Financial markets react to weak U.S. manufacturing data, sending the dollar lower and boosting emerging-market currencies, even as Wall Street celebrates a lucrative year for bankers like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon.
