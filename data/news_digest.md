## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Ukraine faces a massive drone and missile attack on Kyiv, even as US, Russian, and Ukrainian representatives continue peace talks in the UAE. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive economic policies take center stage, with threats of new tariffs on European wine and a potential trade war, while his controversial remarks at the World Economic Forum signal a retreat from liberal democratic leadership, ceding influence to China. Domestic unrest in the US sees tens of thousands of Minnesotans staging strikes to protest ICE operations, while Venezuela remains a flashpoint as Trump pushes for US investment despite lingering sanctions. In lighter news, French President Macron’s sunglasses steal attention at Davos, overshadowing weighty geopolitical discussions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattled investors. The S&P 500 posted its first two-week loss since June, with silver surging past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high as traders sought safe havens. The dollar suffered its worst week since May amid concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, while speculation grew that Japan may intervene in currency markets to stabilize the yen, potentially with U.S. support. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One acquiring fintech Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX lining up Wall Street banks for a potential blockbuster IPO. The Fed's independence came under scrutiny as President Trump's lawsuit against JPMorgan and threats of tariffs on Europe added to market uncertainty, though his abrupt reversal on Greenland tariffs briefly eased tensions. Private credit risks also drew attention, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19% and warnings of a potential meltdown in the $3.4 trillion sector.
