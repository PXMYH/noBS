## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with President Trump's policies taking center stage. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's keynote speech signals a retreat from the liberal democratic order, ceding economic leadership to China, while his first year in office raises concerns among economists about long-term U.S. economic weakening. Meanwhile, his threats of a new trade war persist, even as courts consider curbing his tariff authority. In Europe, Russia-Ukraine peace talks show tentative progress, easing oil prices amid swelling U.S. crude inventories. Elsewhere, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency, particularly the USDT stablecoin, as a hedge against government volatility. The Davos summit also draws attention to French President Macron, whose sunglasses—worn to conceal a burst blood vessel—become an unexpected talking point amid broader geopolitical discussions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded strongly as geopolitical tensions eased and economic data signaled resilience. U.S. stocks surged after President Trump reversed course on proposed European tariffs, sparking relief among investors and a rally in tech and AI-related stocks. The Federal Reserve's pause on rate cuts gained traction as robust job market and consumer spending data reinforced expectations of delayed monetary easing. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and Spirit Airlines exploring a potential takeover by investment firm Castlelake. Commodities saw volatility, with gold hitting record highs amid a weaker dollar, while copper production faced disruptions due to labor strikes in Chile. In policy news, Trump's legal battle with JPMorgan over account closures and his push for a credit card interest rate cap added to financial sector uncertainty, while the Supreme Court signaled skepticism toward his attempt to remove a Fed governor, underscoring concerns about central bank independence.

The tech and business landscape is buzzing with major developments this week. In AI and innovation, Bill Gates' VC fund leads a $110 million investment in chip startup Neurophos, aiming to advance AI model accelerators, while smaller firms challenge Big Tech as AI's most promising investments. Meanwhile, Netflix's aggressive push into advertising yields $1.5 billion in 2025 ad revenue, with expectations to double in 2026, as it revamps its $83 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery to outmaneuver Paramount. Regulatory and legal tensions are also in focus, with the FCC cracking down on late-night TV political appearances and a lawsuit targeting AI recruitment tools over alleged bias. At Davos, the US-China AI race takes center stage, with experts highlighting America's compute capacity advantage, while global leaders debate taxing the ultra-rich amid calls from nearly 400 millionaires for higher levies. Market volatility persists as Intel's weak outlook drags stocks, and small-cap stocks outperform the S&P 500 in their longest win streak since 1996.
