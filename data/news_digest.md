## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic diplomacy dominate this week’s headlines, with Canada making a significant push to repair relations with China. Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives in Beijing for the first Canadian state visit in eight years, seeking to expand trade and lift tariffs amid growing U.S.-China friction. Meanwhile, China’s sensitivity over Taiwan resurfaces after reports reveal Beijing threatened to cancel UK trade talks following a British minister’s visit to Taipei earlier this year. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff defy wartime challenges, expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, signaling resilience in the face of conflict. Elsewhere, India’s government cracks down on the quick-commerce sector, pressuring delivery apps to abandon 10-minute guarantees over concerns for gig workers’ safety. On the energy front, criticism mounts over U.S. President Trump’s aggressive pursuit of Venezuelan oil resources, with analysts warning his approach could undermine long-term American economic strength.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly prioritize value. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures drive more households to seek affordable alternatives for their weekly grocery runs. Aldi's strategy highlights the shifting retail landscape, where traditional supermarkets face mounting pressure from value-focused rivals. The expansion could further disrupt the industry, forcing competitors to adjust pricing and promotions to retain customers.

## 📰 Other News

The Trump administration is intensifying its immigration crackdown, with the State Department halting visa processing for dozens of countries, marking one of its most aggressive moves yet. Meanwhile, economic pressures dominate headlines as rising food prices, housing affordability crises, and expiring Obamacare subsidies strain American households. The administration is exploring drastic measures to lower costs, including threats to companies and policymakers, though internal contradictions—such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pulling back from low-income housing support—undermine these efforts. Internationally, OPEC projects steady oil demand growth through 2027, while the EU and South America finalize a massive free-trade agreement, contrasting with U.S. protectionist trends. Cultural shifts are also notable, with psychedelic therapy gaining legal traction in some states, though access remains limited, and podcasts earning recognition at the Golden Globes, signaling their growing influence in media. Human interest stories, like the revival of *Gourmet* magazine as an unsanctioned newsletter and the late David Mitchell’s fight against drug pricing, add depth to the day’s news.
