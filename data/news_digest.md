## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines this week, with the U.S. making strategic moves to bolster domestic industries and assert influence abroad. The Biden administration signals a major investment in rare earth minerals, committing $1.6 billion to USA Rare Earth in a bid to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains, while President Trump’s push for U.S. investment in Venezuela faces hurdles due to lingering sanctions. Meanwhile, Japan’s yen strengthens amid hints of government intervention to stabilize its currency, as diplomatic friction with China deepens—Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo’s warnings about potential military action over Taiwan. In Europe, the UK tightens trade protections, slashing tariff-free steel imports to shield its domestic market from a global glut fueled by Chinese overproduction. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations, reflecting growing public resistance to federal immigration policies. Against this backdrop, Trump’s threats of a new trade war loom, even as courts weigh limits on his tariff authority, underscoring the volatile intersection of economics and politics.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with heightened volatility as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts dominate headlines. Gold surged past $5,000 an ounce for the first time, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and investor flight to safe-haven assets amid geopolitical uncertainty. Meanwhile, President Trump's threat to raise tariffs on South Korean exports to 25% reignited trade concerns, weighing on Asian equities and adding to market unease. In bond markets, Treasuries extended gains after strong demand at a two-year note auction, reflecting expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. Emerging markets, however, saw record highs as the dollar slid to a four-month low, with Ecuador and Cameroon successfully tapping international debt markets. Corporate activity remained robust, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and Saudi Aramco's $4 billion bond sale standing out. Yet, risks loom in private credit markets, where Wall Street warns of potential meltdowns as the sector balloons to nearly $5 trillion. Against this backdrop, U.S. stocks advanced despite policy risks, buoyed by strong earnings and retail investor resilience, though insurers faced pressure after Medicare payment rate proposals disappointed investors.
