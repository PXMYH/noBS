## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. The US oil market faces its deepest discount to Brent crude in over a year, driven by supply disruptions from Venezuela to the Black Sea, underscoring the fragile balance of global energy flows. Meanwhile, Canada’s former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing in a bid to repair strained Canada-China relations and diversify trade amid worsening US-China ties. The move reflects Ottawa’s urgency to secure new markets as geopolitical rivalries reshape economic alliances. In Europe, Ukraine’s resilience takes center stage as businesses like Nemiroff Vodka defy wartime challenges, expanding exports despite Russian bombings—a testament to the country’s determination to sustain its economy amid ongoing conflict. Diplomatic friction also flares between the UK and China after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks following a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting the delicate balance nations must strike in navigating relations with Beijing. These developments collectively signal a world grappling with economic realignment, persistent conflict, and the high stakes of diplomatic maneuvering.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets and economic indicators present a mixed picture as 2026 begins, with commodities surging while equities face headwinds. Gold, silver, copper, and tin all hit record highs, driven by frenzied buying in China and geopolitical tensions, lifting mining stocks and positioning metals as a red-hot alternative to traditional assets. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks are on track for their first back-to-back loss of the year after lackluster economic data failed to shift Federal Reserve rate expectations, with the S&P 500 retreating as traders digest big bank earnings. The Fed remains cautious, with Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic emphasizing that inflation challenges persist, while Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari notes the next chair will need strong arguments to sway policy. Corporate America is grappling with shifting dynamics: Saks Global, the parent of luxury retailers Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, files for bankruptcy under $3.4 billion in debt, marking a major collapse in the retail sector. In contrast, big banks like Citigroup and Bank of America report strong net interest income, though rising costs and regulatory pressures—including potential credit card rate caps under Trump—cast shadows over future profitability. Deal activity remains brisk, with Netflix reportedly revising its Warner Bros. Discovery bid to an all-cash offer to expedite the acquisition, and Goldman Sachs leading a takeover of a historic LA film lot after a $1.1 billion mortgage default. Global risks are also in focus, as the World Economic Forum flags economic conflicts and tariffs as top concerns, while China’s record $1.19 trillion trade surplus underscores its export-driven growth amid a weakened currency.

Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. grocery market, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discount retailers. The German-owned chain's aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi capturing a larger share of weekly shopping trips across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as shoppers prioritize value amid persistent inflation and economic uncertainty.
