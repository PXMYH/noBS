## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic headwinds and policy shifts, with China's slowing credit growth and record trade surplus underscoring its uneven recovery. Chinese banks extended the fewest new loans in seven years in 2025, reflecting weak demand, while Beijing's weak currency and export-driven surplus hit $1.19 trillion. Meanwhile, China is moving to temper its stock market rally, signaling caution amid volatility. In the U.S., inflation held steady at 2.7% in December, keeping the Federal Reserve under scrutiny as it debates rate cuts. President Trump's push for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates has sparked industry backlash, with banks warning of reduced access to credit. Corporate earnings season kicks off with strong results from JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America, though Saks Global's bankruptcy filing highlights ongoing retail sector struggles. Geopolitical tensions and tariffs remain top risks for businesses, per the World Economic Forum, while Netflix's potential all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery could reshape the media landscape.
