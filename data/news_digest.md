## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The Pentagon also overhauls the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial stance as 'woke' and increasing Defense Department control. In China, an anti-corruption crackdown intensifies, with 69 senior officials punished last year, signaling President Xi Jinping’s continued push against graft. On the economic front, former President Donald Trump invests $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds following their merger announcement, while his administration’s efforts to leverage Venezuelan oil face skepticism from major energy firms.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate shifts as 2026 begins. Equity markets remain resilient, with stocks rallying across major indexes, though investors are closely watching earnings season amid high valuations. The Federal Reserve faces renewed scrutiny after transcripts revealed internal debates over past rate guidance, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell pushes back against political pressure from President Trump, who has threatened legal action against JPMorgan and proposed controversial policies like capping credit card rates at 10%. Meanwhile, emerging markets are seeing a surge in private credit deals, with sovereign wealth funds diversifying away from U.S. assets, while China’s rare-earth exports decline amid rising tensions with Japan. Corporate earnings present a mixed picture: HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk exceed expectations, but major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America report disappointing results, partly due to regulatory and political headwinds. On the policy front, the EU is set to halt a U.S. trade deal in response to Trump’s tariff threats, while Saudi Arabia accelerates its Vision 2030 tourism push to reduce oil dependence. The dollar’s credibility is also under scrutiny as central banks, including Serbia’s, ramp up gold purchases as a hedge against volatility.
