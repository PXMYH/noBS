## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, indefinitely suspending immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The Trump administration also faces skepticism over its push to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves, with analysts suggesting domestic production remains a more viable option. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about military activity in Pacific Ocean regions near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling heightened regional tensions. On the domestic front, former President Trump makes a notable financial move, purchasing $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds shortly after hinting at involvement in their $83 billion merger approval. The entertainment industry sees a leadership shift as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, transitioning to a producing role.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S., announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping. The move underscores a growing shift in the retail landscape, with Aldi and other value-focused retailers gaining ground against traditional supermarkets. Analysts note that rising inflation and economic uncertainty are driving shoppers of all income levels to prioritize affordability, prompting Aldi to capitalize on this trend with aggressive growth. The expansion also reflects broader competition in the grocery sector, where discounters are not only attracting new customers but also securing greater loyalty among existing ones. Industry observers suggest this could reshape consumer habits long-term, as more households adopt discount shopping as a permanent strategy rather than a temporary cost-cutting measure.
