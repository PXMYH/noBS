## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend dominates global headlines, with President Trump signaling plans to 'run' Venezuela ahead of eventual elections. The move has triggered widespread geopolitical and economic repercussions, as oil traders like Trafigura prepare to re-enter Venezuela’s market, while China faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Caracas. The bold U.S. intervention sparks debate in China over potential parallels with Taiwan, with Beijing imposing export controls on Japan amid escalating tensions over Taiwan-related remarks. Meanwhile, domestic U.S. policies under Trump continue to reshape institutions, as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolves after federal funding cuts. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, including a major vodka exporter, press on despite ongoing war disruptions, while global markets react to the Venezuela crisis with cautious optimism in oil prices.
