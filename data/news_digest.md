## 🌍 World & Politics

{
    "summary": "The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious about investing in the politically unstable country, despite Trump’s $100 billion plan to revive its oil sector. The shift in Venezuela’s leadership also eases tensions for Guyana, which faces reduced border-conflict risks amid its own oil boom. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the US expands its influence in a region where Beijing has long held economic dominance.

Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions persist as China threatens to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, while Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation proposals. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing conflict, highlighting resilience amid war. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls on Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases, aiming to address housing affordability. Democratic lawmakers, however, are scrutinizing his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, amid broader diplomatic and economic maneuvering.",
