## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate early 2026 as the U.S. military's capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro sends shockwaves through global markets and diplomacy. The ouster, which follows a U.S. intervention, triggers volatility in Colombian assets amid escalating rhetoric between President Donald Trump and Colombian leader Gustavo Petro. Meanwhile, China faces uncertainty over billions in oil-backed loans to Venezuela, while European defense stocks and precious metals surge on heightened geopolitical risks. The move also prompts the U.S. to close Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, though oil markets remain relatively stable as traders assess Venezuela's future production under potential U.S. revival plans. Beyond Venezuela, China's diplomatic tensions persist, with Beijing threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit and imposing a scallop ban on Japan in retaliation for its Taiwan stance. Elsewhere, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war, while AI adoption in schools sparks debate over its long-term impact on education.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with resilience, as U.S. stocks rose despite geopolitical tensions following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Investors largely shrugged off the event, with tech and energy sectors leading gains, while gold and silver advanced on heightened risk sentiment. The Fed remains a focal point, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggesting limited need for further rate cuts, though internal divisions persist over inflation versus labor market priorities. Meanwhile, commodities saw volatile moves—copper hit a record $13,000 per ton amid a U.S. import rush, while silver retreated sharply after a brief surge. Corporate activity included JPMorgan’s launch of a new advisory group and Comcast’s spinoff of Versant Media, which stumbled in its trading debut. Elsewhere, Argentina’s sovereign risk fell to a seven-year low under President Javier Milei’s reforms, while Mexico extended its 2025 debt spree with new dollar bond sales. However, challenges loom for sectors like retail, with Saks Global’s CEO departure signaling potential bankruptcy, and small manufacturers grappling with tariffs and labor shortages.
