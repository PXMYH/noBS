## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The Pentagon also overhauls the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, accusing it of being 'woke' and increasing Defense Department control. In China, an anti-corruption crackdown intensifies, with 69 senior officials punished last year. On the economic front, former President Trump invests $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds following their merger announcement, while his administration's push to exploit Venezuela's oil faces skepticism from major energy firms.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate shifts as 2026 begins. Emerging markets are seeing a surge in private credit deals, with sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors diversifying away from U.S. assets, while China's rare-earth exports decline amid rising tensions with Japan. The Bank of Japan's upcoming meeting keeps yen traders on edge as speculation grows over potential rate hikes, while the Federal Reserve faces political pressure, with transcripts revealing past missteps and President Trump escalating his feud with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon over debanking claims. Corporate earnings present a mixed picture: HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk outperform, but major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America fall short amid regulatory threats, including Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 tourism push and Stellantis' turnaround efforts highlight broader economic transformations, while gold demand surges as central banks seek hedges against dollar volatility.

## ⚽ Sports

Aldi, the discount grocery chain, is accelerating its expansion in the U.S. with plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026.

Aldi's aggressive growth strategy highlights a broader shift in consumer behavior, with shoppers prioritizing value amid economic pressures.
