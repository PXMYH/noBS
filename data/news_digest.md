## 🌍 World & Politics

Global energy markets are shifting as India's state-owned refiner BPCL moves to secure long-term Middle East crude deals, signaling a potential reduction in reliance on discounted Russian oil. Meanwhile, China's access to cheap Venezuelan crude is dwindling as the final tankers of sanctioned oil approach Asian ports, forcing Beijing to seek alternative sources. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals toward Tether's USDT stablecoin as a hedge against political turmoil, while U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to invest in the country despite President Trump's renewed interest in its reserves. Domestically, Trump's aggressive trade policies and threats of a new tariff war face legal challenges, with courts weighing limits on his executive authority. Congress, however, avoids a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though economic warnings persist about the long-term impact of Trump's policies. In Minnesota, unions and faith groups plan an economic blackout to protest increased ICE operations, reflecting growing tensions over immigration enforcement.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

{
    "summary": "Global markets are reeling from a wave of volatility driven by geopolitical tensions and central bank actions. Japanese government bond (JGB) turmoil has sent shockwaves through financial markets, with liquidity deteriorating to record lows and fears of a spillover into U.S. Treasuries, potentially triggering up to $130 billion in sales. The selloff has weighed on Asian stocks, though Japanese bonds rebounded slightly after Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama called for calm. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies—including threats of new tariffs and a push to annex Greenland—have rattled investors, sending U.S. stocks to their worst day since October and driving safe-haven demand for gold and platinum to record highs. Oil prices have also declined amid the uncertainty, while China’s central bank is resisting yuan appreciation despite a weaker dollar, signaling caution over rapid currency gains.

On the corporate front, Netflix has intensified its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery with an all-cash $82.7 billion offer, aiming to outmaneuver Paramount and accelerate the deal’s completion. The streaming giant also reported strong fourth-quarter earnings but warned of higher programming spending in 2026. Elsewhere, Chinese firms like Pop Mart and Xiaomi are boosting share buybacks to shore up investor confidence, while Novo Nordisk saw an 8% stock surge after strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug. In the U.S., Stellantis is under pressure to execute its turnaround strategy after a 43% stock decline, and FedEx is doubling down on AI and drone technology under CEO Raj Subramaniam. Central banks, meanwhile, are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against dollar instability, reflecting broader concerns about global economic fragmentation.",
