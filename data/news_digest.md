## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. is intensifying its involvement in Venezuela, with the Trump administration seizing two oil tankers and detailing plans to control Venezuelan oil sales after the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The move has sparked geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, which has billions in loans tied to Venezuela’s oil and faces uncertainty over repayment. Meanwhile, domestic political reactions are mixed, as some MAGA-aligned media figures support Trump’s intervention despite past opposition to foreign conflicts. The situation has also disrupted regional airspace, prompting flight cancellations in the Caribbean. Elsewhere, China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface over Taiwan, while Ukrainian businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, continue operations amid ongoing war challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, economic shifts, and corporate maneuvers this week. In Asia, India's 7.4% GDP growth raises questions about its sustainability amid decelerating trends, while South Korea advances its bid for developed-market status by launching 24-hour FX trading in July. Meanwhile, China's consumer price rebound masks lingering deflationary pressures, and Hong Kong's MiniMax surges 91% in its $619 million IPO debut, drawing interest from major investors like Baillie Gifford and GIC. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve faces critical tests to its independence as President Trump pushes policies reshaping trade and housing, including a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase by Fannie and Freddie and tariffs that shrink the trade deficit to a 17-year low. Oil markets remain volatile, with Saudi Arabia cutting prices for a third month and Venezuela emerging as a focal point after Trump's plans to leverage its crude reserves to slash U.S. oil prices to $50 a barrel—though experts doubt oil firms will rush to invest. Corporate highlights include GM's $7.1 billion EV write-down, JPMorgan's takeover of the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, and Saks Global's struggle to secure financing amid potential bankruptcy. The dollar edges higher ahead of key U.S. jobs data, while gold and oil extend gains on geopolitical risks.

Brown, known for his entrepreneurial ventures and philanthropy, frames the issue as a necessary evolution in player-owner relations, signaling a potential shift in how professional sports address athlete compensation beyond salaries. His comments come as the NBA continues to see record-breaking valuations, raising questions about how players can benefit from the league's economic success.
