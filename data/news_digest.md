## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warns of potential intervention to stabilize the yen, signaling rare coordination with the U.S. amid currency volatility. Meanwhile, U.S. domestic politics heat up as Senate Democrats threaten a government shutdown over Republican funding for Homeland Security, while mass protests in Minnesota demand an ICE withdrawal. On the international stage, President Trump's aggressive trade policies dominate headlines, with threats of 100% tariffs on Canada over potential China deals and renewed focus on seizing Venezuelan oil despite lingering sanctions. At Davos, former Canadian Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland emphasizes Ukraine's reconstruction needs, while Trump's isolationist rhetoric at the World Economic Forum cedes economic leadership to China. Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against government instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic shifts, with President Trump's unpredictable trade policies dominating headlines. After initially threatening tariffs on European nations over Greenland, Trump abruptly reversed course, sparking a relief rally in U.S. and European stocks—dubbed the 'Trump Always Chickens Out' (TACO) trade. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and other central banks signal a hold on interest rates, though concerns linger about political interference after Trump's repeated attacks on the Fed's independence. In corporate news, Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex highlights ongoing M&A activity, while SpaceX's rumored $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO underscores the frothy tech market. China's stock market reflects a bifurcated economy, with industrial exporters thriving amid weak domestic consumption, and Japanese authorities weigh yen intervention as currency volatility persists. Energy markets see stabilization as Kazakh oil flows resume, though Trump's Venezuela oil seizure—facilitated by traders like Vitol and Trafigura—adds another layer of complexity to global supply chains.
