## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Donald Trump has declared the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies poised to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. Despite the seismic political shift, oil markets remain largely unaffected, as global supplies absorb any potential disruptions. Meanwhile, North Korea escalated tensions by launching ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, underscoring regional instability. In diplomatic news, China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, while Japan faces economic retaliation from Beijing over its stance on Taiwan. Domestically, the U.S. government’s efficiency and workforce reductions under Trump continue to draw scrutiny, with mixed outcomes for Wall Street’s dealmaking expectations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism, as the S&P 500 inched higher amid mixed signals. Semiconductor stocks led gains, buoyed by anticipation around the CES tech conference and easing concerns over Trump’s tariff policies, though stretched valuations and inflation risks linger. The Fed faces a divided path forward, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson hinting at potential rate cuts later in the year, while minutes from the December meeting revealed deep splits among officials over whether inflation or unemployment poses a greater threat. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Saks Global replaced its CEO as bankruptcy rumors swirled, while SpaceX’s impending IPO drew intense investor interest, potentially becoming the largest public debut ever. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply after a record high and oil fluctuating amid supply surplus concerns. In M&A, London’s largest estate agency chain, Dexters, attracted sale interest valuing it at over £500 million, while Ethiopia reached a deal-in-principle with bondholders to restructure $1 billion in defaulted debt. The AI-driven credit boom continued to fuel corporate borrowing, though risks of a bubble persist as the Trump administration downplays economic warnings tied to the technology’s rapid expansion.

China's BYD surpasses Tesla as the world's top EV seller, reflecting broader industry struggles as automakers pivot back to gas-powered trucks amid slowing demand. Meanwhile, AI continues to drive market optimism, with emerging-market stocks hitting a five-year high on bets around Asia's growing role in the sector, though concerns about an AI bubble persist. Regulatory pressures are also intensifying, as China cracks down on AI chatbots and Europe considers rolling back its 2035 combustion engine ban. In corporate news, Uber restructures contracts to avoid UK taxes, while Paramount secures Larry Ellison's backing in its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.

## ⚽ Sports

The sports world is seeing significant developments both on and off the field. The NBA is making bold moves toward global expansion, actively pursuing ownership groups to launch a professional men’s basketball league in Europe in partnership with FIBA. This potential league could reshape international basketball and create new opportunities for players and fans alike. Meanwhile, the business side of sports media is evolving, with Fox’s free streaming service Tubi surpassing major competitors like Peacock and HBO Max in viewership share, according to Nielsen’s November report. The rise of free, ad-supported streaming platforms is challenging traditional sports broadcasting models, offering fans more accessible ways to consume content. On a more concerning note, youth sports are facing a crisis as research highlights the emotional and physical toll of overbearing coaching and parental pressure, leading to burnout and injuries among young athletes. The trend raises questions about the professionalization of youth sports and its long-term impact on participation and well-being.
