    "summary": "The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily administer Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies poised to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. The move has triggered regional tensions, prompting Venezuela’s Supreme Court to grant temporary presidential powers to Vice President Delcy Rodríguez. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed airspace over the Caribbean, citing safety risks, and oil markets remain largely unaffected despite Venezuela’s vast reserves. In Asia, North Korea launched ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, while China continues to exert economic pressure on Japan over Taiwan-related tensions, including a ban on Japanese scallops. Diplomatic strains also surfaced between China and the UK after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan threatened trade talks.",

    "summary": "Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism, as the S&P 500 inched higher amid mixed signals. Semiconductor stocks led gains, buoyed by anticipation for the CES conference and easing tariff concerns, while long-maturity Treasuries fell on inflation fears despite the Fed's 2025 rate cuts.

The AI-driven credit boom continues to reshape financial markets, fueling record corporate bond trading and venture capital activity, though risks of overvaluation persist. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply from record highs and oil fluctuating between supply surplus concerns and geopolitical tensions. China's move to restrict silver exports adds another layer of uncertainty to global metal markets.",
