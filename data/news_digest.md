## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic instability dominate this week's headlines, with Venezuela emerging as a focal point. Locals in the crisis-stricken nation are increasingly adopting USDT, a Tether-issued stablecoin, to shield themselves from political and economic volatility, highlighting the broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in unstable regimes. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over parts of the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling heightened regional tensions. In Australia, the government pushes forward with controversial hate speech legislation while searching for a new ambassador to the U.S., following Kevin Rudd’s early departure. The move underscores Canberra’s efforts to navigate diplomatic relations amid domestic policy debates. Elsewhere, former President Donald Trump’s renewed interest in Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, who view domestic production as a more viable alternative. The intersection of economic strategy and geopolitical maneuvering continues to shape global dynamics.
