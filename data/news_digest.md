## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with the U.S. and China at the center of global power struggles. President Trump’s keynote at the World Economic Forum signals a retreat from liberal democratic leadership, ceding ground to China, which stands to benefit from the vacuum. Meanwhile, Trump’s threats of a new trade war loom as courts debate curtailing his tariff authority, adding uncertainty to global markets. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals to adopt Tether’s USDT stablecoin as a hedge against government volatility, even as U.S. sanctions complicate potential investment under Trump’s administration. Domestically, Minnesota sees widespread strikes protesting ICE’s expanded presence, with organizers demanding the agency’s removal and an investigation into alleged constitutional violations. Elsewhere, French President Emmanuel Macron’s health draws unexpected attention at Davos, overshadowing critical geopolitical discussions, while the Pentagon faces pushback over attempts to control the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, accused of being 'woke.' These developments highlight a world grappling with shifting alliances, economic instability, and domestic unrest.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank moves, and corporate dealmaking. The dollar is experiencing its worst week since May amid unpredictable U.S. policymaking, while silver surged past $100 an ounce as investors flock to safe-haven assets. Paraguay’s central bank surprised with a quarter-point rate cut, citing easing inflation, while the Fed’s independence faces scrutiny as the Supreme Court weighs President Trump’s attempt to remove a Fed governor. Corporate activity remains brisk, with Capital One acquiring fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX lining up Wall Street banks for a potential blockbuster IPO. Meanwhile, Trump’s $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan over alleged political discrimination adds to market uncertainty, and private credit growth sparks warnings of rising risks. Earnings season reveals jittery consumer sentiment, though strong demand in sectors like defense and premium travel offers bright spots.
