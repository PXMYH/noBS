## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are navigating a tense period as central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, signal a pause on interest rate changes amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The Fed's cautious stance comes as President Trump escalates pressure on the central bank, threatening legal action and pushing for lower rates, while the Supreme Court weighs the implications of Fed independence. Meanwhile, markets are reacting to mixed signals: the S&P 500 posts its first two-week loss since June, silver surges past $100, and speculative bets on yen intervention by Japan—potentially with U.S. support—intensify after currency market tremors. Corporate activity remains brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and SpaceX's preparations for a blockbuster IPO, while private credit markets face growing scrutiny as BlackRock writes down a debt fund by 19%. Trade tensions flare anew as Trump reverses course on tariffs, sparking relief in global markets, though threats of 200% tariffs on European wine loom. Retail traders continue to defy Wall Street's 'Sell America' sentiment, while emerging markets and gold gain traction as investors diversify away from U.S. assets.
