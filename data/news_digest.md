## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate headlines as global markets react to fiscal instability and political shifts. In the U.S., Congress secures a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown, easing short-term fiscal concerns, but warnings from Citadel’s Ken Griffin underscore deeper anxieties. Griffin frames Japan’s recent bond selloff as a stark warning for Washington to address its mounting debt, signaling potential turbulence ahead for U.S. financial markets. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive trade policies continue to stir controversy, with threats of a new trade war looming even as courts consider reining in his tariff authority. Economists caution that his first-year policies, though yet to show major economic shifts, could weaken the U.S. in the long term. Internationally, Venezuela’s economic crisis drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against instability, reflecting broader trends in regions grappling with political volatility. Domestic unrest also flares in Minnesota, where unions and faith groups plan an economic blackout to protest increased ICE operations following a high-profile killing, highlighting growing tensions over immigration enforcement.

In corporate news, Netflix sweetened its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, intensifying the media consolidation battle, while quant hedge funds suffered their worst losses since October as crowded trades unraveled.
