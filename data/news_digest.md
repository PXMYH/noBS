## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic instability dominate headlines this week, with Venezuela at the center of multiple developments. Locals in the crisis-stricken nation are increasingly adopting Tether’s USDT stablecoin to shield themselves from political and economic volatility, reflecting broader distrust in unstable regimes. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issues warnings about heightened military activity in the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, urging pilots to exercise caution—a move that underscores rising regional security concerns. On the diplomatic front, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s self-proclaimed authority over Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major oil giants, who appear reluctant to engage amid legal and logistical uncertainties. Elsewhere, Hollywood sees a leadership shift as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking the end of an era for the *Star Wars* franchise.
