## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration continues to make bold moves on multiple fronts, with significant implications for both domestic and international affairs. In a controversial decision, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over its editorial direction and aligning it more closely with Defense Department priorities. Meanwhile, the administration indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a move that could further strain diplomatic relations. On the energy front, Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major oil companies, which may prefer domestic sources over the geopolitical risks of operating in the crisis-stricken nation. Internationally, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S.-China tensions escalate. The entertainment industry also sees a major shift as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking a leadership change in the *Star Wars* franchise.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are navigating a mix of corporate earnings, geopolitical tensions, and policy shifts as 2026 kicks off. Major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, delivered mixed Q4 results, with wealth management outperforming but credit card rate caps proposed by the Trump administration casting a shadow over financial stocks. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with Vice Chair Philip Jefferson calling current policy 'well positioned,' though traders now anticipate no rate cuts before June amid political pressure and a DOJ probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Meanwhile, commodities see volatility: oil recovers slightly on Iran tensions, while gold dips as Trump hesitates on Fed leadership picks. Corporate activity is brisk, with Novo Nordisk surging 8% on strong Wegovy sales, and IPO filings from defense firm York Space Systems and biopharma SpyGlass Pharma signaling confidence in niche sectors. However, retail struggles persist, as Saks' bankruptcy rattles creditors like Amazon, and gambling stocks tumble on competition from prediction markets. Central banks globally are pivoting, with Bolivia earning a Fitch upgrade and Ecuador eyeing a return to debt markets, while gold demand rises as institutions seek hedges against dollar uncertainty.

## 💻 Technology

This week’s tech and business headlines are dominated by AI advancements and regulatory shifts. OpenAI begins testing ads in ChatGPT for U.S. users, marking a new revenue push for its flagship AI product. Meanwhile, President Trump imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X, citing national security concerns, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the blow. The move follows broader trade negotiations, including a deal with Taiwan to lower tariffs and expand U.S. chip manufacturing. In other developments, Starlink’s satellite internet proves critical for Iranian activists bypassing government blackouts, while the U.S. considers expanding private sector roles in cyberwarfare. Financial markets react to these shifts, with AI-related stocks experiencing volatility amid China’s DeepSeek advancements. Beyond tech, economic data shows modest U.S. job growth, and Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries, though safety concerns linger after an N.T.S.B. report on a UPS plane crash.
