## 🌍 World & Politics

Global markets and geopolitical tensions are in flux following the U.S. military operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend. The move, led by President Donald Trump, has sparked financial volatility, with Colombian assets dropping amid rising tensions between Washington and Bogotá, while European defense stocks and precious metals surge on heightened geopolitical risks. The U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, and Trump has pledged to revive Venezuela’s oil sector, boosting U.S. energy stocks. Meanwhile, China faces uncertainty over its oil deals with Venezuela, as billions in loans to Caracas hang in the balance. Beyond Venezuela, diplomatic strains persist elsewhere: China threatened to cancel UK trade talks after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, and Beijing’s ban on Japanese scallops underscores escalating tensions over Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing war disruptions, signaling resilience amid conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic optimism. The US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro sent shockwaves through commodity markets, driving gold and silver higher while oil prices fluctuated amid uncertainty over Venezuelan production. Despite the geopolitical risks, US stocks rose, buoyed by strong demand for technology shares, as investors largely shrugged off the Venezuela crisis. Meanwhile, copper surged to a record $13,000 per ton, fueled by supply concerns and trade disruptions. In corporate news, Comcast’s spinoff Versant began trading on Nasdaq, marking a rare media debut, while Saks Global faced leadership changes and potential bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve’s minutes revealed deep divisions over further rate cuts, with officials split on whether inflation or unemployment poses a greater risk. Elsewhere, Argentina’s sovereign risk fell to a seven-year low under President Javier Milei’s reforms, and Saudi Arabia tested bond market appetite with a new dollar deal. The year ahead is marked by caution over tech valuations, Fed policy, and the sustainability of the AI-driven market rally.
