## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as Ukraine launches strikes on Russian oil platforms in the Caspian Sea, targeting Lukoil facilities to undermine Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push to secure Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from U.S. oil executives and Wall Street, with concerns over political instability and China’s entrenched economic influence in Latin America. The administration also seeks expanded powers to pressure defense contractors over delays, while Greenland’s labor leaders firmly reject Trump’s annexation proposals. In diplomatic developments, China threatened to derail UK trade talks after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing’s sensitivity over the issue. Domestically, Trump calls on Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes, citing housing market distortions, while Democratic lawmakers demand an investigation into a controversial Middle East envoy.
