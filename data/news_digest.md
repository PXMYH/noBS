## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate headlines as President Trump escalates threats of a new trade war, even as courts weigh limiting his tariff authority. His first year in office leaves economists warning of long-term economic weakening, while his controversial stance on Venezuela—where he has declared himself 'acting president'—faces skepticism from major oil companies reluctant to engage amid instability. Meanwhile, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, offering temporary relief amid political divisions. In Minnesota, unions and faith groups plan an economic blackout to protest increased ICE operations following a high-profile killing, highlighting domestic unrest over immigration policies. Internationally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity over Latin American waters, urging caution for flights near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling rising regional tensions. Against this backdrop, Venezuela’s economic collapse drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against hyperinflation, underscoring the broader impact of political instability on global markets.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty take center stage. The S&P 500 suffered its worst drop in months, falling over 2% on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs over Greenland, sparking fears of a trade war with Europe. The selloff extended to Treasuries and municipal bonds, with yields surging amid a rout in Japanese government debt and broader risk aversion. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces fresh turmoil as Trump’s efforts to reshape the central bank intensify, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinting a new Fed chair could be named as soon as next week. Corporate developments also made waves, as Netflix sweetened its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming to outmaneuver Paramount, while Boeing shares finally recouped losses from its 2024 midair crisis. Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug, and Alibaba-backed AI startup Moonshot saw its valuation climb to $4.8 billion ahead of a funding round.
