## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with President Trump's isolationist policies reshaping international relations. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's rejection of the liberal democratic order signals a further retreat from U.S. leadership, ceding ground to China in the global economy. Meanwhile, his administration's mixed signals on Venezuela—expressing interest in U.S. investment while maintaining sanctions—highlight ongoing geopolitical contradictions. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations, accusing the agency of constitutional violations. The Pentagon's attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticized as 'woke,' sparks pushback from lawmakers and the outlet's leadership, underscoring broader debates over institutional independence. Amid economic instability, Venezuelans increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against political turmoil, reflecting broader trends in financially unstable regions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced a volatile week as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts rattled investor sentiment. The S&P 500 logged its second consecutive weekly decline, with traders grappling with President Trump’s abrupt tariff threats against Europe and a sudden reversal on Greenland, sparking synchronized selloffs reminiscent of pandemic-era turbulence. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, while safe-haven assets like gold and silver surged—silver even topped $100 an ounce for the first time—amid heightened uncertainty. Meanwhile, Japan’s bond market turmoil and a sharp yen rally, fueled by intervention speculation, added to the unease, while private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a fund by 19% and warnings of a potential meltdown growing louder. Corporate activity remained brisk, highlighted by Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech Brex and SpaceX’s reported preparations for a blockbuster IPO, even as AMC’s debt talks and Spirit Airlines’ bankruptcy negotiations underscored lingering financial stresses. Economic data revealed sticky inflation, with consumer prices rising 2.8% through November, keeping the Fed’s policy path under scrutiny as Trump’s legal battle with JPMorgan and pressure on the central bank’s independence further clouded the outlook.
