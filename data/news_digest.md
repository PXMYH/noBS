## 🌍 World & Politics

The US's dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend has sent shockwaves through global geopolitics and energy markets. China, a key ally of Maduro, condemns the move as a 'hegemonic act' and warns it could escalate tensions, with some Chinese analysts suggesting it sets a precedent for Taiwan. The oil market is fluctuating as traders assess the impact on Venezuela's crude supply, though short-term disruptions may be mitigated by sanctioned oil stored at sea. Meanwhile, businesses in Venezuela, like Toyota, are adjusting operations amid the uncertainty, while airlines cancel flights due to US airspace restrictions over the Caribbean. Beyond Venezuela, diplomatic tensions persist, with China previously threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit and using trade bans, like Japanese scallops, as leverage. Domestically, the US government faces scrutiny over efficiency under Trump's downsizing efforts, while Wall Street's anticipated deal surge in 2025 fell short of expectations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with a mix of optimism and caution, as investor enthusiasm for AI-driven growth collides with geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Emerging-market stocks surge toward record highs, fueled by Asian tech rallies, while copper prices climb on supply concerns and a risk-on sentiment. However, China’s services sector slows to a six-month low, and Japan’s long-dated bonds falter amid lingering fiscal and inflation worries. The Federal Reserve faces internal divisions over rate cuts, with minutes revealing a split between inflation and unemployment risks, while the Trump administration’s influence over monetary policy raises concerns about central bank independence. Meanwhile, corporate struggles persist, with Saks Global preparing for a potential $1 billion bankruptcy loan and Warren Buffett’s departure from Berkshire Hathaway marking a leadership shift. Geopolitical tensions, particularly surrounding Venezuela’s oil output and U.S. sanctions, add volatility to commodity markets, with gold and silver advancing on safe-haven demand.

TSMC shares surged after Goldman Sachs raised its target by 35%, reflecting optimism in AI demand and semiconductor growth. Meanwhile, China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's top EV seller in 2025, underscoring the competitive pressures in the electric vehicle market amid policy changes and slowing subsidies.

Regulatory developments include China tightening AI chatbot rules around sensitive topics like suicide and gambling, and Europe potentially rolling back its 2035 combustion engine ban, signaling a shift in climate policy priorities. The U.S. also faces economic and geopolitical challenges, with Trump's administration reversing decades of tech restrictions by allowing Nvidia chip sales to China, raising security concerns.
