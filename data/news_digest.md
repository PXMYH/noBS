## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, marking a major geopolitical shift as Washington gains de facto control over 40% of the world’s oil reserves. The move has sparked debates in China, where some view it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others warn of overreach. Investors are weighing the risks and opportunities in Venezuela, with estimates suggesting a $750 billion investment potential, though China’s debt claims and legal uncertainties loom large. Meanwhile, emerging markets rally as initial fears over the intervention subside, though oil prices dip amid progress in Ukraine peace talks. Elsewhere, France faces a budget crisis with a projected 5.4% deficit, and China escalates economic tensions by banning Japanese scallops over Taiwan-related disputes. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, dissolving the 58-year-old institution, while airlines cancel flights after the FAA closes Caribbean airspace due to the Venezuela operation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are kicking off 2026 with a mix of geopolitical shifts, corporate maneuvering, and central bank uncertainty. The U.S. stock market is approaching fresh records, buoyed by optimism around Federal Reserve rate cuts, though Fed minutes reveal deep divisions among officials over inflation and unemployment risks. Energy stocks surged 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela’s political upheaval, with Weatherford’s CEO calling the country a 'massive opportunity' for oil after Nicolás Maduro’s ouster. Meanwhile, Argentina’s Treasury is stockpiling dollars ahead of a key debt payment, while Zambia’s kwacha rallies on new forex restrictions. In corporate news, Hg’s $6.4 billion takeover of OneStream and Charter’s $1.75 billion junk bond refinancing highlight robust M&A and debt activity. However, Saks Global’s CEO departure amid bankruptcy rumors and Berkshire Hathaway’s leadership transition underscore lingering economic pressures. Commodities are volatile, with cotton hitting an eight-week high and silver plunging 8% after a record rally, while China’s new silver export restrictions add to supply concerns.
