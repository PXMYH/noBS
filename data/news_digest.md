## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines this week, with Venezuela emerging as a focal point. China's access to cheap Venezuelan oil is nearing its end as the last sanctioned tankers arrive in Asia, marking a shift in energy dynamics. Meanwhile, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and political uncertainty. In Japan, bond yields surge to record highs amid investor skepticism over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s tax-cut proposals, raising concerns about fiscal stability. The FAA also issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama. Elsewhere, Tata Motors strategically bids for 6,000 electric buses in India, avoiding price wars, while U.S. oil giants remain hesitant about Trump’s push to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves, favoring domestic production instead.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face heightened volatility as geopolitical tensions and central bank policies dominate headlines. A selloff in Japanese government bonds, with 40-year yields surging past 4% for the first time, pressures the Bank of Japan to accelerate rate hikes, while U.S. Treasuries and global equities decline amid Trump’s tariff threats over Greenland, fueling fears of a transatlantic trade war. Gold surges to a record $4,700 an ounce as investors seek safe havens, while oil markets remain steady despite surplus concerns. Meanwhile, China’s economic divide widens, with manufacturing and tech sectors outpacing consumer-driven growth, even as its real estate slump weighs on household savings. Corporate developments include Novo Nordisk’s 8% stock jump on strong Wegovy sales, Stellantis’ turnaround efforts, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley beating earnings estimates. Business leaders at Davos emphasize AI and M&A as key growth drivers, while prediction markets gain traction amid regulatory debates.
