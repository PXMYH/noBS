## 🌍 World & Politics

Global trade tensions escalate as President Donald Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariffs if it pursues a trade deal with China, signaling a potential new front in his protectionist agenda. The UK also moves to tighten trade restrictions, considering reductions in tariff-free steel imports amid a global glut and rising protectionism. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains deepen between China and Japan, with Chinese tourism to Japan plummeting after Tokyo's remarks on Taiwan, underscoring the fragile state of regional relations. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations, reflecting growing public resistance to immigration enforcement policies. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against government volatility, while Trump's push for U.S. investment in the country remains hampered by lingering sanctions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant volatility as geopolitical tensions and economic policy shifts dominate headlines. Gold surges past $5,000 an ounce for the first time, driven by investor flight to safe-haven assets amid uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies and global instability. The dollar weakens to a four-month low, while Treasuries rise alongside European bonds, reflecting cautious sentiment ahead of key auctions. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with notable deals including Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and China’s Zijin Mining Group’s C$5.5 billion purchase of Allied Gold. However, risks loom in private credit markets, where BlackRock’s private debt fund suffers steep losses after loan writedowns, and regulators warn of a potential meltdown in the rapidly growing $3.4 trillion sector. On the policy front, Trump’s aggressive trade stance—including threats of 100% tariffs on Canadian imports and a lawsuit against JPMorgan—further rattles markets, while Brazil’s next leader faces pressure to stabilize public debt. Retail trends show resilience, with consumers stretching budgets at thrift stores like Goodwill, even as inflation remains sticky at 2.8% through November 2025.

## 💻 Technology

This week's headlines are dominated by the intersection of AI, corporate strategy, and global economic shifts. Baker Hughes doubles its data center equipment order target to $3 billion, reflecting the surging demand for AI-powered infrastructure, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang prepares for a pivotal visit to China amid stalled AI chip sales. Meanwhile, TikTok undergoes a major corporate restructuring in the U.S., spinning off its American operations to address regulatory pressures, though questions remain about potential changes for users. The tech sector also sees notable movements, with Netflix's ad revenue strategy yielding $1.5 billion in 2025 and projections to double this year, signaling a shift in its business model. Beyond tech, severe winter storms disrupt U.S. air travel, canceling over 16,000 flights and prompting Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to assure a return to normalcy by midweek. Regulatory and legal developments are also in focus, as the U.S. Treasury cancels $21 million in contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton over data protection failures, and the IMF raises its global growth forecast to 3.3% for 2026, citing AI investment as a key driver.
