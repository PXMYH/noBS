## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week. Japan’s finance minister signals potential direct intervention to stabilize the yen, reflecting growing concerns over currency volatility. Meanwhile, the Trump administration escalates its controversial foreign policy, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries—including Brazil, Iran, and Russia—citing welfare concerns, while also pushing aggressive moves toward Venezuela’s oil reserves, a strategy critics argue could undermine U.S. economic stability. Former Biden advisor Amos Hochstein warns against simplistic approaches to Iran, emphasizing the complexity of regime change compared to Venezuela. On the diplomatic front, Canada’s Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained relations and explore new trade opportunities amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Domestically, the Pentagon faces scrutiny over plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, accused of political bias, while Lucasfilm undergoes leadership changes with Kathleen Kennedy stepping down as president.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals as investors navigate economic resilience, policy shifts, and corporate challenges. Asian markets, particularly China, are drawing renewed optimism from regional investors, with BofA noting stronger bullish sentiment compared to cautious US peers. Meanwhile, corporate bond yield premiums have hit their lowest since 2007, reflecting confidence in economic stability. However, volatility looms as the Bank of Japan's upcoming meeting and Japan's snap election add uncertainty to the yen. In the US, major banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs report strong earnings in wealth and asset management, while Bank of America, Citi, and JPMorgan face pressure from potential credit card rate caps proposed by the Trump administration. The retail sector is under strain, with Saks Global filing for bankruptcy after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus, while Amazon threatens legal action over its $475 million stake in the failed deal. Commodities are also in focus, with silver prices surging—benefiting investors but squeezing solar panel manufacturers—while India's Russian oil imports face potential declines, leaving cargoes stranded. Central bank independence remains a hot topic, with Fed officials warning that political interference could reignite inflation.

Financial markets show mixed signals, with tech stocks rallying amid AI optimism, while the Treasury market remains unusually stagnant. Elsewhere, Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries, and the UK economy posts better-than-expected growth despite political uncertainty.
