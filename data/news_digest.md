## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with geopolitical rivalries and trade disputes taking center stage. In the U.S., President Trump escalates protectionist measures, threatening a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a trade deal with China, while the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut driven by Chinese production. Meanwhile, China's diplomatic clashes with the Philippines over the South China Sea and Japan over Taiwan continue to strain regional relations, with Chinese tourism to Japan plummeting amid the dispute. On the economic front, defense stocks surge amid global instability, though investors await earnings reports to gauge sustainability, while Venezuela's economic turmoil drives locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against instability. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations, reflecting growing public pushback against immigration enforcement policies.
