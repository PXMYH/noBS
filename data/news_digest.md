## 🌍 World & Politics

Global trade tensions and economic protectionism dominate headlines this week, with the UK poised to tighten tariff-free steel imports amid a global glut driven by Chinese production. Meanwhile, President Trump escalates threats of a new trade war, even as U.S. courts weigh whether to curb his tariff authority. His administration also faces challenges in Venezuela, where sanctions complicate potential U.S. investment despite Trump's interest in expanding economic ties. In Asia, diplomatic strains between China and Japan deepen as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo's warnings about military intervention in Taiwan. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota, where tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations and an investigation into alleged constitutional violations. Against this backdrop, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals to adopt cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against political and financial turmoil, highlighting broader trends in unstable regimes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant volatility driven by geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and shifting trade dynamics. Gold prices have surged past $5,000 an ounce, reflecting investor flight to safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and a weakening U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Japan faces bond market turmoil, with a $41 billion rout in government debt raising concerns about real estate investment trusts and potential currency intervention. Corporate activity remains robust, highlighted by China’s Zijin Gold acquiring Allied Gold for $4 billion and Capital One’s $5.15 billion purchase of fintech startup Brex. The Trump administration’s aggressive trade policies, including threatened tariffs on South Korea and Canada, are further destabilizing global supply chains, while China’s industrial profits show signs of recovery after years of decline. Against this backdrop, Wall Street is grappling with risks in private credit markets and regulatory pressures on insurers, even as small businesses report resilience amid broader economic challenges.
