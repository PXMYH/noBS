## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In the Americas, Colombia's Grupo Argos considers re-entering Venezuela following the US-backed removal of President Nicolás Maduro, signaling potential economic recovery and asset reclamation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump escalates trade threats, warning Canada of 100% tariffs if it pursues a deal with China, while the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut and rising protectionism. Domestic unrest in the US sees mass protests in Minnesota against ICE operations, reflecting growing public opposition to immigration enforcement policies. Internationally, China-Japan relations deteriorate as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets after Tokyo's remarks on Taiwan, underscoring regional military tensions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are experiencing significant volatility as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid geopolitical uncertainty and shifting monetary policies. Gold surged past $5,000 per ounce for the first time, while silver posted its largest gain since 2008, driven by global tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. Treasury yields fell as strong demand for two-year notes reinforced expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One acquiring fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion and Spirit Airlines in takeover talks with Castlelake. Earnings season is underway, with Procter & Gamble beating profit estimates but reporting weaker-than-expected revenue, reflecting mixed consumer demand. The Fed's policy path remains a focal point, with traders speculating on potential leadership changes, including BlackRock's Rick Rieder as a contender for Fed chair. In global markets, Japan's fiscal policies are influencing bond markets, while Ecuador returns to international debt markets for the first time since its 2020 restructuring.

## ⚽ Sports

The Washington Post reverses its earlier decision to skip in-person coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics, now committing to send a small team of reporters to Italy just weeks before the Games begin. The abrupt shift follows initial plans to forgo on-site reporting, underscoring the event's global significance despite logistical challenges. Meanwhile, in golf, Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf continues its partnership with the Trump Organization, announcing another tournament at the former president's New Jersey resort. This marks at least the sixth LIV event hosted at a Trump property in four years, reinforcing the league's controversial ties to both Saudi funding and U.S. political figures. The move comes as LIV Golf solidifies its presence in the sports landscape, despite ongoing debates about its impact on traditional golf tours.
