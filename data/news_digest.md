## 🌍 World & Politics

Global trade tensions escalate as President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a deal with China, while the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut driven by Chinese production. The protectionist shift underscores a broader retreat from liberal economic policies, with Trump's World Economic Forum speech signaling a further abandonment of the post-war democratic order. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains deepen between China and Japan, as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo's warnings about potential military intervention in Taiwan. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota against an ICE crackdown, with organizers demanding the agency's removal from the state. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as sanctions and political turmoil persist, even as Trump eyes U.S. investment in the country's oil sector despite lingering restrictions.
