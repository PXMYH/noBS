## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s policies sparking concerns over a potential trade war and long-term economic consequences for the U.S. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump’s renouncement of the liberal democratic order signals a retreat from global leadership, leaving a vacuum China appears poised to fill. Meanwhile, geopolitical instability and freezing weather in key agricultural regions like the U.S. and Russia drive wheat prices higher, adding to global economic pressures. Domestically, Minnesota sees a widespread economic strike as protesters demand the removal of ICE from the state, citing constitutional violations. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT to shield themselves from political and economic turmoil, highlighting the broader impact of unstable governance. Additionally, efforts to protect the independence of the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* from Pentagon control underscore ongoing debates over press freedom within the U.S. military.
