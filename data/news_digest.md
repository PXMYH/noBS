## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Trump announced the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela and oversee the rebuilding of its oil infrastructure, though oil markets remain largely unaffected despite Venezuela's vast reserves. The move follows weeks of escalating tensions, including a U.S. blockade that disrupted oil shipments to the country. Meanwhile, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung arrives in Beijing for a high-stakes summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, aimed at stabilizing relations amid rising regional tensions—underscored by North Korea’s missile launch just hours before the meeting. In other diplomatic news, China previously threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting Beijing’s growing assertiveness on the global stage. Domestically, the Trump administration’s restructuring of the federal workforce continues to draw scrutiny, with critics arguing it has weakened government efficiency.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism, as the S&P 500 inched higher amid mixed signals. Semiconductor stocks led gains, buoyed by anticipation for the CES tech conference, while concerns over stretched valuations and inflation lingered. The Federal Reserve faces a divided path forward, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson hinting at potential rate cuts later in the year, though minutes from the December meeting revealed deep splits among officials over whether inflation or unemployment poses a greater risk. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Saks Global replaced its CEO as it reportedly prepares for bankruptcy, while private equity firm Oakley Capital explores a sale of London estate agency Dexters for over £500 million. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply after a record high, and oil fluctuating amid supply surplus concerns. Ethiopia also reached a deal-in-principle with bondholders to restructure $1 billion in defaulted debt, signaling progress in its financial recovery.

## ⚽ Sports

The sports world is seeing significant developments both on and off the field. The NBA is making strides in global expansion, actively pursuing ownership groups to launch a new professional men’s basketball league in Europe in partnership with FIBA. This move could reshape international basketball and create new opportunities for players and fans alike. Meanwhile, the business side of sports is evolving, with Fox’s free streaming service Tubi surpassing major competitors like Peacock and HBO Max in viewership share, according to Nielsen’s November report, signaling a shift in how audiences consume sports and entertainment content. On a more concerning note, youth sports are facing a crisis as research highlights the emotional and physical toll of overbearing coaches and parents, leading to burnout and injuries among young athletes. These trends underscore the growing pressures in both professional and amateur sports, from business strategies to athlete well-being.
