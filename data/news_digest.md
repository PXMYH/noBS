## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. Euro-area finance ministers are poised to select the European Central Bank’s next vice president, a move that could shape the institution’s future leadership as Christine Lagarde’s term nears its end. Meanwhile, financial markets react to escalating trade disputes, with copper prices surging toward $13,000 as the dollar weakens amid President Donald Trump’s threats of tariffs on Greenland, while China’s economic growth meets government targets. In Japan, government bonds slump following reports of a potential food tax cut, raising fiscal concerns ahead of an anticipated snap election next month. On the security front, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issues warnings about military activity in parts of the Pacific Ocean near Latin American countries, urging pilots to exercise caution. Additionally, Trump’s controversial claims over Venezuela’s oil resources face skepticism from major energy firms, who may prefer domestic production over risky foreign ventures.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face fresh volatility as President Donald Trump’s threat of tariffs on European nations over Greenland sparks risk aversion, sending stock futures lower and driving gold and silver to record highs. The dollar weakens amid policy uncertainty, while oil prices stabilize as geopolitical tensions ease. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk surges 8% on strong Wegovy sales, contrasting with earnings misses at major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America, which are grappling with Trump’s proposed credit card rate cap. Meanwhile, China’s economic woes deepen as real estate slumps and investment drops, though exports helped GDP meet targets. Central banks, including Romania’s, hold rates firm to combat stubborn inflation, while Japan’s economy shows signs of strain from a weak yen and rising costs.
