## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines. Euro-area finance ministers are poised to select the European Central Bank's next vice president, a move that could signal broader leadership changes as Christine Lagarde's term nears its end. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration issues warnings to pilots over heightened military activity in parts of the Pacific Ocean near Latin American countries, including Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, raising concerns about regional stability. In the U.S., former President Donald Trump's push to leverage Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from major oil giants, who may prefer domestic production over risky foreign ventures. Additionally, Hollywood sees a leadership shakeup as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking a shift in the 'Star Wars' franchise's direction.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face renewed volatility as President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies—including proposed tariffs on European nations over Greenland and threats to cap credit card interest rates—rattle investor sentiment. Stock futures in the U.S. and Europe decline, while gold and silver surge to record highs amid safe-haven demand. The dollar weakens as geopolitical tensions escalate, with Trump's actions also complicating Fed policy discussions, as Jerome Powell navigates political pressure and a DOJ investigation. Meanwhile, corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk deliver strong results, but major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America underperform amid regulatory uncertainty. In Asia, China's export-driven growth hits a 27-year high, though its real estate crisis persists, while India's Clean Max prepares a scaled-back IPO amid investor caution. Commodities remain under pressure, with iron ore falling on oversupply concerns and oil stabilizing amid shifting geopolitical risks.
