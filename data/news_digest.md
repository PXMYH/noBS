## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week's headlines, with Venezuela at the center of U.S. strategic interests. President Donald Trump meets with oil executives, including Exxon Mobil's CEO, to discuss long-term investments in Venezuela following Nicolás Maduro's removal, though industry leaders remain cautious amid political instability and sanctions concerns. Meanwhile, Trump's aggressive push into Latin America draws scrutiny as China, the region's dominant lender, monitors U.S. moves closely. Elsewhere, Greenland's labor union leader firmly rejects Trump's annexation claims, while oil prices surge for a third consecutive week as Iran's crackdown on protests and U.S. threats of intervention heighten regional tensions. In Europe, a UK minister's visit to Taiwan earlier in the year triggered a diplomatic row with China, which threatened to cancel trade talks, underscoring the fragile balance in international relations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with strong momentum, as U.S. stocks surged to fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, December’s jobs report, showing a sharper-than-expected drop in unemployment, dampened bets on an imminent January rate cut, with traders now pricing in minimal chances of easing this month. The Fed’s cautious stance is reinforced by lingering inflation concerns, though analysts anticipate potential cuts later in the year if labor market conditions soften. Meanwhile, corporate activity is heating up, with IPOs from First Student, EquipmentShare, and Motive Technologies set to launch, while merger talks between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore signal a potential $260 billion deal that could reshape the industry. In policy news, President Trump’s directive for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds aims to boost housing affordability, though critics warn of risks reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis. Tariff uncertainties also loom, with the Supreme Court’s pending ruling on trade policies creating volatility for sectors like American whiskey exporters. Elsewhere, General Motors reported a $7.1 billion earnings hit tied to its scaled-back EV ambitions, reflecting shifting consumer demand and policy changes, while Walmart-backed fintech OnePay hit a $4 billion valuation, underscoring the growing intersection of retail and financial services.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape opens 2026 with a mix of AI controversies, corporate shake-ups, and shifting market dynamics. Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, faces backlash for generating sexualized images of real people, prompting X to restrict access to paid subscribers amid regulatory scrutiny. Meanwhile, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin further distance themselves from California, signaling a broader trend of tech leaders diversifying their personal and professional ties. In corporate news, Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount’s $108 billion hostile takeover bid, doubling down on its Netflix partnership, while GM and Ford announce major financial hits tied to EV slowdowns and restructuring. The job market shows signs of cooling, with December’s modest 50,000 new jobs capping the weakest year for U.S. hiring since the pandemic, raising questions about economic policy under Trump’s second term. AI’s legal and ethical challenges also take center stage, as Google and Character.AI settle a lawsuit over a teenager’s death linked to an AI chatbot, and China investigates Meta’s acquisition of AI startup Manus for potential compliance violations.
