## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with President Trump's aggressive trade policies and geopolitical maneuvers taking center stage. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and his threats to seize Greenland underscore his confrontational approach to foreign policy, while his renouncement of liberal democratic principles signals a further retreat from U.S. global leadership. Meanwhile, China stands to benefit as the U.S. steps back, amplifying concerns over shifting economic power dynamics. Domestically, Trump's tariff threats—particularly against European wine—risk escalating trade disputes, even as courts consider limiting his authority. In Venezuela, despite Trump's interest in U.S. investment, sanctions continue to stifle opportunities, pushing locals toward cryptocurrencies like USDT to hedge against instability. Protests in Minnesota highlight growing opposition to ICE's expanded operations, reflecting broader domestic unrest over immigration policies. Elsewhere, France's Macron draws unexpected attention at Davos, not for policy but for his stylish sunglasses, a lighthearted contrast to the forum's weighty geopolitical discussions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policy moves rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, while silver surged past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hit a 16-week high as traders sought safe havens amid turmoil. The yen staged its biggest one-day jump since August on speculation of Japanese currency intervention, while the dollar suffered its worst week since May. Meanwhile, corporate dealmaking remained active, with Capital One acquiring fintech Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX lining up banks for a potential blockbuster IPO. The Fed's independence came under scrutiny as Trump's legal battle with JPMorgan and pressure on the central bank raised concerns about political interference in monetary policy.

Meanwhile, Apple is quietly reshaping its leadership pipeline, expanding hardware chief John Ternus' role to include design—a clear signal he’s being groomed as a potential successor to CEO Tim Cook.

Regulatory shifts are also in focus, as TikTok updates its U.S. terms following a corporate restructuring to distance itself from its Chinese parent company, and the FCC cracks down on late-night TV shows hosting political candidates. Elsewhere, Big Tech’s record bond issuances to fund AI ambitions are raising economic concerns, and a lawsuit challenges AI-driven hiring tools, questioning their legality under credit reporting laws.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire, announcing its latest tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This marks at least the sixth event hosted at a Trump property in the past four years, underscoring the league’s strategic partnership with the Trump brand amid its ongoing rivalry with traditional golf tours. The move highlights LIV Golf’s efforts to secure high-profile venues as it seeks to solidify its position in the sport, despite lingering controversy over its Saudi funding and the broader political implications of its alliances. Meanwhile, the tournament adds to the growing list of major golf events scheduled at Trump-owned courses, reinforcing the former president’s enduring influence in the sport even as legal and political challenges persist elsewhere.
