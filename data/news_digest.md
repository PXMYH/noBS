## 🌍 World & Politics

Global markets and geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as Japan's stock market prepares for a surge amid a weaker yen and speculation over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's potential snap election. Meanwhile, Bolivia's President Rodrigo Paz secures a critical agreement to phase out fuel subsidies, marking an early victory in his economic reform agenda. In energy markets, oil prices hit a one-month high due to unrest in Iran and growing concerns over supply disruptions, while President Trump's push to revive Venezuela's oil sector faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives and analysts. The move, part of a broader Latin America strategy, risks exacerbating a global oil glut and straining U.S. economic leverage, with China closely monitoring developments as it maintains its dominant trade and lending position in the region. Elsewhere, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Ukraine's Nemiroff vodka producer defies wartime challenges by expanding exports to Western markets.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank scrutiny, and corporate shifts. Oil prices surged to a one-month high after President Trump announced tariffs on countries trading with Iran, while the S&P 500 hit fresh records despite escalating concerns over Federal Reserve independence. A Justice Department probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell has sparked backlash from former Fed officials and market unease, though stocks and bonds showed resilience. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Medline's post-IPO rally and GigaDevice's $600 million Hong Kong debut highlighting strong investor appetite for AI and healthcare sectors. In Latin America, Argentina secured multilateral funds to repay a $2.5 billion U.S. swap, while the Philippine peso's record weakness raises questions about central bank intervention. The Fed's cautious stance on rate cuts persists amid solid jobs data, keeping market expectations in check.
