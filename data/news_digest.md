## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures dominate global headlines this week, with Russia facing logistical challenges as at least 12 tankers carrying Urals crude idle off the Omani coast, signaling potential disruptions in its oil exports. Meanwhile, oil prices surge above $65 a barrel amid escalating U.S. pressure on Iran and attacks on Black Sea tankers, exacerbating supply concerns. In Latin America, President Trump’s push to expand U.S. influence in Venezuela’s oil sector meets resistance from wary energy executives, while China watches closely, having already established itself as the region’s dominant economic partner. Ukraine’s corporate sector grapples with a $3 billion debt crisis as Russian strikes intensify, forcing businesses to seek debt extensions, though some, like vodka maker Nemiroff, continue expanding exports despite wartime challenges. Diplomatic strains also flare as China threatens to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, underscoring Beijing’s assertive stance on sovereignty issues.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are reacting to a mix of inflation data, central bank actions, and political tensions. U.S. Treasuries surge after softer-than-expected inflation figures reinforce bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut by June, while stocks rise on hopes of easing monetary policy. However, a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside Trump administration pressure for rate cuts, sparks concerns over central bank independence, drawing rare public support from global counterparts like the ECB and Bank of England. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal mixed results: JPMorgan beats estimates despite a drop in investment-banking fees, while US Bancorp announces a $1 billion acquisition of BTIG to expand its trading business. In commodities, gold holds near record highs amid geopolitical uncertainty, and European defense stocks face valuation concerns after a 20% rally this year. Trade tensions persist as Trump’s proposed 10% credit card rate cap alarms banks, and China-EU talks aim to resolve electric vehicle tariff disputes.
