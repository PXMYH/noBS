## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is making bold moves to reshape Venezuela’s oil industry, announcing plans to seize and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan crude while easing some sanctions to facilitate ongoing sales. The U.S. has already intercepted two tankers, including a Russian-flagged vessel, as part of an intensifying blockade, signaling a major shift in energy geopolitics. Meanwhile, Mexico pledges to continue oil shipments to Cuba as humanitarian aid, defying U.S. pressure. Domestically, Trump is pushing Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes and cracking down on defense contractors over executive pay, even as he seeks a record $1.5 trillion military budget. The fallout from Venezuela’s leadership change is rippling globally, with China reassessing its oil deals and debating lessons for Taiwan, while airlines cancel flights amid U.S. airspace restrictions over the Caribbean. The seizure of Nicolás Maduro has sparked debates about interventionism, even among Trump’s usual allies, and left investors scrambling to adapt to the new landscape.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face headwinds as 2026 momentum fades, with Asian equities poised to open lower amid mixed U.S. economic data and geopolitical tensions. The Federal Reserve's independence is under scrutiny as President Trump pushes policies like banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases, rattling housing stocks and sparking debate over central bank autonomy. Meanwhile, Venezuela dominates energy and bond markets after U.S. forces seized control of its oil exports, prompting a surge in Venezuelan bond trading and volatility in crude prices. Corporate America sees shifts as Warren Buffett exits Berkshire Hathaway, GameStop ties CEO pay to a $100 billion valuation, and SpaceX prepares for a potential record-breaking IPO. Commodities remain volatile, with silver and platinum plunging amid U.S. tariff risks and China's export restrictions, while Japan's bond market braces for a supply shock.
