## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic diplomacy dominate this week’s headlines. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrives in Beijing for the first state visit in eight years, aiming to repair strained relations and secure new trade opportunities amid U.S.-China tensions. Meanwhile, China’s earlier threat to cancel UK trade talks over a British minister’s Taiwan visit underscores Beijing’s sensitivity to Taiwan-related diplomacy. In the U.S., the Trump administration faces criticism for its approach to Venezuela’s oil resources, with analysts warning it could undermine long-term American economic strength. Domestically, concerns arise over political interference in military media, as applicants for *Stars and Stripes* face loyalty tests tied to administration priorities. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff vodka expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, while India’s government cracks down on 10-minute delivery services, citing risks to gig workers.

## 📰 Other News

Economic pressures and policy shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with housing affordability emerging as a central theme. President Trump faces criticism as his administration’s housing policies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s retreat from low-income assistance under Bill Pulte, clash with his public push to address rising costs. Meanwhile, families grapple with soaring childcare expenses, with one in five reporting financial strain, and food prices surge, particularly for beef, coffee, and produce. The Supreme Court’s growing favoritism toward wealthy litigants and California’s controversial billionaire tax proposal further highlight the nation’s economic divides. Internationally, the EU and South America finalize a landmark free-trade deal, contrasting with the U.S.’s more coercive trade tactics, while China’s state media amplifies narratives of American poverty to deflect from domestic challenges. On the cultural front, the Golden Globes introduces a best podcast category, signaling the medium’s rising prominence, and Gourmet Magazine resurfaces as an unsanctioned newsletter, blending nostalgia with modern media’s rebellious spirit.
