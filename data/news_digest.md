## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic shifts as the U.S. doubles down on its 'America First' policies, disrupting long-standing trade relationships. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are holding interest rates steady amid lingering inflation concerns, with the Fed facing political pressure from President Trump, who continues to push for lower rates despite warnings of a potential 'sugar high' economic effect. Meanwhile, China’s stock market reflects a bifurcated economy, with industrial exporters thriving while consumer-facing sectors struggle. Corporate activity remains robust, highlighted by Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a blockbuster IPO, while private credit markets show signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19%.
