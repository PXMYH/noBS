## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic tensions dominate headlines as leaders navigate corruption scandals, diplomatic shifts, and military concerns. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces pressure amid a corruption scandal, prompting outreach to potential rivals as calls for elections grow. Meanwhile, China intensifies its anti-corruption crackdown, punishing 69 senior officials last year, signaling Beijing’s continued focus on internal discipline. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi considers suspending food sales taxes ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution, a move aimed at bolstering her election campaign. The U.S. makes waves in international relations, with the Trump administration halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, while also asserting influence over Venezuela’s oil sector despite skepticism from major energy firms. Diplomatic efforts are underway elsewhere, as former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Military tensions rise as the FAA warns pilots of heightened activity near Latin American waters, reflecting broader geopolitical unease.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures, with the Federal Reserve at the center of a growing storm. The Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, coupled with President Trump’s push for lower interest rates and a 10% cap on credit card rates, has rattled financial institutions and sparked debates over central bank independence. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains resilient, with small-cap stocks outperforming broader indexes and major banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs posting strong earnings despite regulatory uncertainties. Corporate America is also in flux, as Novo Nordisk surges on strong obesity drug sales, Saks files for bankruptcy after its Neiman Marcus acquisition, and York Space Systems prepares for a $544 million IPO. Overseas, Japan’s stock rally faces risks from inflation and rising borrowing costs, while Ecuador eyes a return to global debt markets after a seven-year hiatus. The broader economic landscape is marked by rising food prices, a shift toward gold as central banks diversify away from the dollar, and growing tensions between policymakers and industries like crypto, where Coinbase’s lobbying power is reshaping regulatory debates.
