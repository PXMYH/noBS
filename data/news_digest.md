## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which has sent shockwaves through global markets and diplomatic circles. The move has disrupted Venezuela’s oil industry, throwing foreign oil claims into uncertainty and prompting China to condemn Washington’s intervention as 'hegemonic.' While the dollar strengthens amid rising geopolitical risks, China’s short-term oil supply concerns are mitigated by stockpiled crude at sea. Meanwhile, airlines cancel flights as the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, and businesses like Toyota adopt remote work in Venezuela amid the instability. Beyond Venezuela, tensions persist between China and the West, with Beijing threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and imposing a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for perceived support of Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing bombings, signaling resilience amid war. Domestically, the U.S. government faces scrutiny over efficiency under Trump’s downsizing efforts, while Wall Street’s anticipated dealmaking boom in 2025 fell short of expectations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with a mix of optimism and caution, as investors weigh geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and the enduring AI-driven rally. Equities extend last year’s gains, with European stocks tipped for further growth and Wall Street strategists forecasting another strong year for the S&P 500, despite concerns over sky-high valuations and inflation. The Fed faces internal divisions over rate cuts, while Trump’s influence looms large over monetary policy and trade, with tariffs raising prices but falling short of expectations. Commodities see volatility: copper surges toward record highs on supply fears, while silver retreats sharply after China announces export restrictions. Meanwhile, high-profile IPOs—including India’s SBI Funds Management and MiniMax’s AI-driven Hong Kong debut—highlight robust investor appetite, even as corporate struggles like Saks Global’s leadership shakeup and FC Barcelona’s debt crisis underscore lingering economic pressures.
