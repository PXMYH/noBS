## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures dominate global headlines this week. In the UK, the Bank of Scotland faces a £160,000 fine for facilitating banking services for a sanctioned ally of Vladimir Putin, highlighting ongoing challenges in enforcing Western sanctions against Russian elites. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains between China and Japan escalate as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets by nearly half following Tokyo’s warnings about potential military intervention in Taiwan, underscoring the fragile state of East Asian relations. In the U.S., President Trump’s aggressive trade rhetoric resurfaces as courts debate limiting his tariff authority, while his administration explores investment opportunities in Venezuela despite lingering sanctions that complicate business ventures. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand the removal of ICE, reflecting growing public opposition to federal immigration policies. Amid economic instability, Venezuelans increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT to shield savings from political turmoil, a trend mirrored in other volatile regimes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, monetary policy shifts, and corporate maneuvering. Gold surges past $5,000 an ounce, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar and investor flight from sovereign bonds, while silver's rally is fueled by speculative demand and physical buying. The Trump administration's protectionist policies continue to rattle trade relations, with new tariff threats on South Korea and a $1.6 billion investment in USA Rare Earth, amplifying concerns over supply chain disruptions. Meanwhile, central banks face pressure as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley challenge South Africa's inflation outlook ahead of a key rate decision, and Japan weighs currency intervention amid yen volatility. Corporate activity remains brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and Elliott Management's pushback against Toyota's buyout bid, while GM braces for a $7.1 billion write-down tied to its EV restructuring. Retail investors defy broader market caution, snapping up dips, but risks loom in private credit and commercial real estate lending.
