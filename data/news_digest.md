## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warns of potential intervention to stabilize the yen, signaling rare coordination with the U.S. amid economic volatility. Meanwhile, U.S. domestic politics heat up as Senate Democrats threaten a government shutdown over Republican funding for Homeland Security, while mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations. On the international stage, President Trump's aggressive trade threats—including a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa engages with China—underscore a shifting global order, with analysts warning of China's rising influence as the U.S. retreats from traditional leadership roles. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT, while Trump's push for U.S. investment in the country faces hurdles from lingering sanctions. Diplomatic maneuvering continues as Chrystia Freeland, now an adviser to Ukraine's Zelenskiy, emphasizes that peace talks hinge on Putin's next moves, even as Davos attendees grapple with broader geopolitical uncertainties.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank caution, and corporate maneuvering as 2026 unfolds. The Federal Reserve and other major central banks are holding interest rates steady amid lingering inflation concerns, with U.S. consumer prices rising 2.8% through November 2025, signaling sticky inflation. Meanwhile, President Trump’s unpredictable trade policies—including a sudden reversal on European tariffs and threats of 200% levies on French wine—are rattling allies and markets, though his about-face on Greenland tariffs briefly buoyed stocks. In corporate news, Big Tech earnings are under scrutiny as investors weigh whether AI-driven niche stocks will outperform broader market giants, while SpaceX’s rumored $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO underscores the frothy appetite for high-growth tech. Saudi Arabia’s decision to open its property market to foreign buyers is lifting local developers, and Japan’s currency intervention speculation is adding volatility to Asian markets. Elsewhere, private credit’s rapid growth to $4.9 trillion by 2029 is raising alarms on Wall Street, and Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex highlights ongoing consolidation in financial services.
