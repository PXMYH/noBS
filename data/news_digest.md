## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as geopolitical and economic rifts deepen. In the U.S., Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, threaten a government shutdown over Republican funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations. Meanwhile, President Trump intensifies trade threats, vowing a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China, further straining North American relations. His aggressive stance extends to Venezuela, where he pledges to seize and process its oil despite lingering sanctions. At Davos, former Canadian Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland, now advising Ukraine, insists the 'ball is in Putin’s court' for peace talks, while Trump’s isolationist rhetoric at the forum cedes global economic leadership to China. Financial instability looms as Japan’s Prime Minister Takaichi warns of intervention amid yen volatility, and Venezuela’s economic crisis drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT for stability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank decisions, and corporate maneuvering as 2026 unfolds. The Federal Reserve and other major central banks are holding interest rates steady, signaling caution amid economic uncertainty, while speculation grows about potential Fed leadership changes under President Trump. In Asia, Japan’s bond market volatility and potential yen intervention are rattling investors, while China’s stock market reflects a divide between export-driven industrial growth and sluggish consumer demand. Corporate activity is heating up, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a blockbuster IPO, though private credit markets show signs of strain as BlackRock writes down a debt fund by 19%. Meanwhile, Trump’s erratic trade policies—including threats of tariffs on European wine and a sudden reversal on Greenland—continue to disrupt markets, sparking relief rallies when tensions ease. Retail investors are defying Wall Street’s bearish sentiment, while emerging markets and gold benefit from a weakening dollar and diversification trends.

## 💻 Technology

This week's tech and business landscape is dominated by AI's growing influence and its economic ripple effects. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid tightening U.S. export controls, while the IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, hitting young workers hardest. Meanwhile, Big Tech is taking on record debt—$108.7 billion in Q4 alone—to fund AI ambitions, raising concerns about broader economic risks. TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. also makes headlines, with the app spinning off its American operations under new ownership tied to Trump allies, though users may see minimal immediate changes. Beyond AI, regulatory shifts are reshaping industries: the FCC cracks down on late-night TV political appearances, and a new U.S. rule accelerates deep-sea mining permits, benefiting firms like The Metals Company. In travel, airlines grapple with mass cancellations as a winter storm batters the U.S., while facial recognition at airports becomes more ubiquitous despite privacy debates. The week also sees Netflix's ad revenue surging to $1.5 billion, with expectations to double in 2026, signaling a strategic pivot paying off.

The move underscores the growing influence of Saudi-backed LIV Golf in the sport, despite ongoing controversies surrounding its partnership with the former president’s business empire. Elsewhere, the sudden shift in Olympic media coverage raises questions about logistical challenges or potential disputes ahead of the high-profile event.
