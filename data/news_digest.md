## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing signs of shifting dynamics in early 2026, with investors pivoting away from the AI-driven rally that dominated the past three years. The S&P 500's energy sector surged 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela's oil market, following Nicolás Maduro's arrest and Trump's claims of potential oil shipments to the U.S. Meanwhile, European markets are drawing interest as U.S. investors seek diversification beyond tech-heavy stocks, though Euro-area inflation easing to the ECB's target suggests steady rates ahead. In commodities, iron ore hit a 10-month high on China's economic support outlook, while the PBOC extended its gold-buying streak for a 14th month. Corporate developments include Samsung's $350 billion rally on record earnings expectations and Saks Global's leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors. The Fed faces political pressures as Trump seeks to reshape the institution, while Minneapolis Fed's Kashkari signals limited rate cuts ahead.
