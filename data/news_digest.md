## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic political shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces mounting pressure amid a corruption scandal, prompting outreach to potential rivals as calls for elections grow louder. Meanwhile, China intensifies its anti-corruption drive, punishing 69 high-ranking officials last year, signaling Beijing's continued crackdown on graft. On the economic front, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi considers suspending food sales taxes ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution, aiming to bolster her election campaign. The U.S. makes waves in international relations, with the Trump administration halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, while also asserting influence over Venezuela’s oil sector—though major energy firms remain hesitant. Diplomatic maneuvers continue as former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations amid worsening U.S.-China ties. Military tensions rise in Latin America, with the FAA warning pilots of heightened activity near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador, underscoring regional instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic optimism and political uncertainty as 2026 begins. German industrial stocks rally, signaling potential recovery in Europe, while Japan's market surge faces risks from inflation and rising borrowing costs under Prime Minister Takaichi's policies. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with former officials and analysts warning that political pressure—including a DOJ investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell—threatens central bank independence, which could reignite inflation. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal mixed results: major banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs outperform in wealth management, but Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo struggle amid Trump's proposed 10% credit card rate cap, a move banks fiercely oppose. High-profile bankruptcies, like Saks Global's collapse following its Neiman Marcus acquisition, underscore retail sector strains, while Novo Nordisk soars 8% on strong demand for its obesity drug Wegovy. Elsewhere, crypto firm Coinbase flexes its political muscle by blocking a Senate crypto bill, and Ecuador plans a return to global debt markets after a seven-year hiatus. Energy and commodities see shifting dynamics, with hedge funds slashing silver bets and central banks stockpiling gold as a hedge against dollar volatility.
