## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a trade deal with China, signaling a potential new trade war. Meanwhile, Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, emphasizes that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding Ukraine negotiations, while Trump’s aggressive stance on Venezuela—including plans to seize its oil—highlights his unorthodox foreign policy approach. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations, reflecting growing public resistance to immigration enforcement. Economically, France faces criticism from its central bank over insufficient deficit reduction, while Venezuela’s citizens increasingly turn to cryptocurrency like USDT amid political instability. These developments underscore a fractured global order, with Trump’s protectionist policies and geopolitical brinkmanship reshaping international relations.

## 💻 Technology

{
    "summary": "The tech and business landscape is dominated by AI's growing influence and its economic ripple effects. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid tightening U.S. export controls, while Big Tech's record $108.7 billion in bond issuances highlights the financial strain of funding AI ambitions. Meanwhile, the IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with young workers bearing the brunt, as automation reshapes industries from law to manufacturing. TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. aims to distance itself from Chinese ownership, though questions linger about user experience changes, while regulatory pressures mount on platforms like Netflix, which is doubling down on its ad strategy after hitting $1.5 billion in ad revenue last year.

Beyond AI, geopolitical and economic tensions simmer as President Trump's unpredictable policies—from trade threats to Greenland to a potential Fed chair pick—keep global markets on edge. Mining stocks surge amid a metals supercycle fueled by AI demand, while seabed mining accelerates under new U.S. rules. In corporate moves, Berkshire Hathaway prepares to exit its troubled Kraft Heinz stake, and United Airlines forecasts record earnings, signaling resilience in consumer travel despite broader economic uncertainty. Legal challenges also emerge, with job applicants suing AI recruitment tools over alleged discriminatory algorithms, reflecting growing scrutiny of automated decision-making systems.",
