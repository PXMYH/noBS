## 🌍 World & Politics

Global trade tensions escalate as President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a deal with China, signaling a potential new trade war. Meanwhile, the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut driven by Chinese production, reflecting rising protectionism. In Venezuela, Trump's push for U.S. investment in the country's oil sector faces hurdles due to lingering sanctions, even as locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies like USDT to shield against economic instability. Diplomatic strains deepen between China and Japan, with Chinese tourism plummeting after Tokyo's remarks on Taiwan, while Russia's Nornickel faces setbacks in a Chinese copper smelter project. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations, highlighting growing civil unrest over immigration policies.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant volatility as geopolitical tensions and shifting monetary policies reshape investor sentiment. The U.S. dollar continues its decline, hitting a four-month low amid speculation of potential coordinated currency intervention with Japan to support the yen. Gold surges past $5,000 per ounce, driven by safe-haven demand as President Trump's 'America First' policies disrupt global trade norms. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's preparations for a blockbuster IPO. Economic indicators present a mixed picture: U.S. small businesses show resilience, but Germany's business outlook unexpectedly weakens, reflecting broader concerns about sluggish growth. The Federal Reserve faces pressure from Trump, who is pushing for lower interest rates while also proposing a 10% cap on credit card rates—a move that has paradoxically lifted bank stocks. Against this backdrop, emerging markets like Zambia are capitalizing on commodity rallies, with plans for new IPOs and a gold-linked ETF.
