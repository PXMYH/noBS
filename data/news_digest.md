## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are navigating a tense period as central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, signal a pause on interest rate changes amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The Fed's cautious stance comes as President Trump escalates pressure on the central bank, threatening legal action and advocating for lower rates, which analysts warn could create a short-term economic 'sugar high' with long-term risks. Meanwhile, markets are reacting to mixed signals: the S&P 500 posts its first two-week loss since June, while commodities like silver surge past $100, and emerging markets, along with gold, attract diversified investment flows. Corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's preparations for a potential $800 billion IPO, though private credit markets show signs of strain, as BlackRock writes down a fund by 19%. Trade tensions also dominate, with Trump reversing course on tariffs—sparking market relief—but maintaining threats against European wine imports, while Japan weighs currency intervention to stabilize the yen.

## 💻 Technology

{
    "summary": "This week's tech and business landscape is dominated by AI's growing influence and its economic ripple effects. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid tightening U.S. export controls, while the IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with young workers facing the brunt of the impact. Meanwhile, Big Tech is taking on record debt—$108.7 billion in Q4 alone—to fund AI ambitions, raising concerns about broader economic risks. TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. also makes headlines, with the platform spinning off its American operations under new ownership tied to Trump allies, though users may see minimal immediate changes. Beyond AI, regulatory and geopolitical tensions simmer, from the FCC cracking down on late-night TV political appearances to Trump's erratic economic policies unsettling global markets at Davos. The mining sector is also in focus, with metals demand surging due to AI and green tech, sparking a potential supercycle as companies like The Metals Company expand seabed mining operations.

    In other developments, Netflix's ad strategy is paying off, with revenues hitting $1.5 billion in 2025 and projections to double this year, while United Airlines reports a strong start to 2026, signaling robust travel demand despite winter storm disruptions. The housing market, however, shows signs of strain, with pending home sales dropping sharply in December amid record-low inventory. Legal challenges to AI are emerging too, as job applicants sue an AI recruitment tool company, alleging its screening software operates like an unregulated credit agency. Finally, facial recognition technology is becoming more ubiquitous at airports, streamlining check-ins but reigniting privacy debates.",
