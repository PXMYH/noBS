## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with bold geopolitical and domestic moves. The State Department indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, Trump's push to assert control over Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from U.S. energy giants, who prefer domestic production, raising questions about the economic viability of his aggressive foreign policy. The Pentagon also announces plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, tightening Defense Department control amid accusations of political bias. Internationally, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa's pivot toward new trade partnerships as U.S. ties fray. These developments underscore a period of heightened tension in global affairs, with Trump's unilateral actions reshaping alliances and economic strategies.
