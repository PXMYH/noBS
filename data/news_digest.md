## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines this week, with President Trump's aggressive trade policies and diplomatic shifts reshaping international relations. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's keynote speech signals a retreat from the liberal democratic order, ceding economic leadership to China, while economists warn his first-year policies could weaken the U.S. economy long-term. Meanwhile, a U.S. court weighs curbing Trump's tariff authority, though he continues to threaten a new trade war, escalating uncertainties in global markets. Wheat prices surge amid freezing weather in the U.S. and Russia, compounding concerns over food security and geopolitical instability. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to USDT stablecoins as a hedge against economic collapse, highlighting the broader impact of political instability on financial systems. Domestically, the Pentagon faces criticism over attempts to control the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, sparking a debate over press freedom within the armed forces. These developments underscore a volatile global landscape, where economic policies, military oversight, and financial adaptations reflect deeper geopolitical fractures.
