## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Asia, South Korea’s stock exchange plans to extend trading hours as its benchmark index surges toward President Lee Jae Myung’s ambitious 5,000-point target, reflecting regional economic optimism. Meanwhile, Japan’s markets hit record highs amid speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call a snap election, signaling potential political volatility. In Latin America, President Trump’s aggressive push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives, who remain wary of the region’s instability. The move, part of a broader strategy to counter China’s deep economic influence in the region, risks exacerbating a global oil glut and undermining U.S. shale producers already struggling with low prices. Elsewhere, China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring the fragile state of international relations. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue to defy wartime challenges, expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, highlighting resilience amid conflict.

## 💻 Technology

Tech and AI dominate headlines as Google's parent company, Alphabet, hits a $4 trillion valuation following a landmark AI deal with Apple to power Siri with Gemini, propelling it past Apple as the world's second-most valuable company. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, faces regulatory scrutiny in the UK and bans in Malaysia and Indonesia over sexually explicit AI-generated images, prompting X to restrict image requests to paid subscribers. In corporate moves, JPMorgan's asset management arm ditches controversial proxy advisors in favor of AI-driven analysis, while Boeing secures its largest order ever from Alaska Airlines for 110 new jets. The tech sector's surge contrasts with broader economic concerns, as U.S. job growth slows and Trump's policies, including a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates, spark debate. Elsewhere, automakers like Ford and Stellantis adjust strategies amid an EV slowdown, while China's property sector shows signs of strain with Vanke seeking bond extensions.
