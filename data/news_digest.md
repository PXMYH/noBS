## 🌍 World & Politics

Global economic and geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as President Trump pushes a controversial $100 billion plan to revive Venezuela’s oil sector, facing skepticism from U.S. oil executives wary of political risks and market instability. The move, seen as a bid to counter China’s deepening influence in Latin America, could exacerbate a global oil supply glut, further pressuring U.S. frackers already grappling with four-year-low prices. Meanwhile, China asserts its economic leverage, threatening to derail UK trade talks after a British minister’s Taiwan visit, while also tightening regulations on domestic tech giants like Meituan and Alibaba to curb aggressive price wars. In Europe, Bolivia’s government prepares a new economic decree amid protests, maintaining fuel subsidy cuts, while Ukraine’s businesses, including a major vodka exporter, defiantly expand operations despite ongoing Russian attacks. Diplomatic friction escalates as Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into a U.S. Middle East envoy, and prediction markets debate the definition of a U.S. invasion in Venezuela.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are on edge as the Trump administration escalates its pressure on the Federal Reserve, with the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The move, condemned by former Fed leaders and lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, has reignited fears over central bank independence, triggering volatility in stocks, bonds, and commodities. Gold and silver surged to record highs, while the dollar weakened amid a revived 'sell America' trade. Meanwhile, corporate battles intensify, with Paramount Skydance escalating its fight against Warner Bros. Discovery by nominating directors to block a potential Netflix merger and filing a lawsuit for financial transparency. In other developments, General Motors reported a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions, and European and Chinese officials took steps to ease trade tensions over electric vehicle tariffs. Emerging markets saw gains as investors sought alternatives to U.S. assets, while corporate earnings, like Tata Consultancy Services' miss, reflected ongoing economic caution.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures drive more households to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping.
