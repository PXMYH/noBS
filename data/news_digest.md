## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian energy infrastructure by striking oil drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea, aiming to cripple Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making aggressive moves in Latin America, as President Trump pushes to secure Venezuela’s vast oil reserves—though his $100 billion plan faces skepticism from major oil executives and investors wary of political instability. The fall of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, reportedly orchestrated by the U.S., eases border tensions with oil-rich Guyana, while China watches Washington’s expanding influence in the region with concern, given its own deep economic ties there. Elsewhere, Greenland’s leadership firmly rejects Trump’s annexation proposals, and China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface after threats to cancel trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls on Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes, citing housing market distortions.
