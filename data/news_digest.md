## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. intervention in Venezuela, where Nicolás Maduro was captured and flown to New York to face charges, prompting a swift shift in global energy markets and diplomatic recalibrations. The U.S. now plans to oversee Venezuela’s transition, with elections expected later, while energy traders like Trafigura engage in talks to resume Venezuelan oil purchases. The move has sparked debates in China, where some view it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others warn of overreach. Meanwhile, China-Japan tensions escalate as Beijing imposes military export controls and bans Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s Taiwan stance. Elsewhere, Russia’s oil revenues plummet amid sanctions, further straining its war economy, while Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, adapt to wartime challenges. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, marking a major shift in media policy, and airlines cancel flights after the FAA restricts Caribbean airspace due to the Venezuela operation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and shifting economic trends. The S&P 500's early-year rally stalls amid sector rotation, with energy stocks surging 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela’s oil potential after President Trump’s interventionist moves, including proposals to subsidize U.S. energy firms rebuilding the country’s oil industry. Meanwhile, German inflation cools to 2%, reinforcing the ECB’s rate-hold stance, while the Fed grapples with internal divisions over further cuts, as minutes reveal a split between inflation and labor market concerns. Emerging markets draw investor interest, with the risk premium on EM bonds hitting a 13-year low, though Africa faces currency devaluation risks due to weak oil prices. Corporate activity highlights include BlueScope Steel’s $8.8 billion takeover bid and Saks Global’s leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors, while Nvidia’s $4 trillion valuation faces growing scrutiny. Commodities see volatility, with silver rallying on Chinese demand before a sharp retreat, and gold steadying as traders focus on U.S. data over Venezuela tensions.
