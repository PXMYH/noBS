Global markets are navigating a mix of economic optimism and geopolitical tension as 2026 begins. U.S. stocks face their first back-to-back losses of the year amid policy uncertainty ahead of midterm elections, while metals like gold, silver, and copper surge to record highs on expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and renewed Chinese market confidence. Corporate earnings reports, including JPMorgan’s strong trading revenue, paint a resilient picture of consumer and business activity, though inflation remains steady at 2.7%, keeping the Fed cautious. Meanwhile, geopolitical risks dominate headlines, with Trump’s tariff policies and the 'Donroe Doctrine' fueling trade disputes, while central banks rally around Fed Chair Jerome Powell amid a Justice Department investigation, underscoring concerns over political interference. In Europe, France’s bond sale draws massive demand despite fiscal risks, while China’s record trade surplus and weak yen raise deflationary fears for the continent. High-profile business moves include Jollibee’s planned U.S. IPO, Astorg’s €2 billion IQ-EQ sale, and Saks’ bankruptcy filing, reflecting ongoing retail sector struggles.
