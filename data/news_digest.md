## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate maneuvering as 2026 kicks off. The Bank of Japan’s upcoming meeting has yen traders on edge amid speculation over rate hikes, while the Federal Reserve faces renewed pressure from the Trump administration, with Chair Jerome Powell defending the central bank’s independence as a DOJ investigation looms. Meanwhile, China’s rare-earth export decline and Hong Kong’s gold exchange deal with Shanghai underscore shifting trade dynamics in Asia. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk beat expectations, but major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America struggle amid Trump’s threatened credit card rate caps. In M&A, Netflix’s bold bid for Warner Bros. Discovery’s film and TV assets signals a content war escalation, while Saks’ bankruptcy after its Neiman Marcus acquisition highlights retail sector strains. Geopolitical risks also flare, with the EU halting a U.S. trade deal over Trump’s tariff threats and Venezuela’s oil sector drawing speculative interest from smaller firms tied to the administration.
