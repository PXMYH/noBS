## 🌍 World & Politics

Global economic and political tensions dominate headlines as President Trump's policies continue to reshape international relations. At the World Economic Forum, Trump's keynote speech signals a further retreat from the liberal democratic order, ceding ground to China, which is increasingly seen as a leader in the global economy. Meanwhile, Trump's threats of a new trade war loom, even as U.S. courts consider limiting his tariff authority. Economists warn his first-year policies, though initially inconsequential, may weaken the U.S. economy long-term. Domestically, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, while Minnesota braces for an economic blackout protest against ICE operations following a high-profile killing. In financial markets, Japan's super-long bonds recover after a selloff triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's tax-cut proposals, reflecting investor jitters over fiscal policy shifts. Elsewhere, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against government volatility, highlighting broader trends in unstable regimes.
