## 🌍 World & Politics

The US's dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend has sent shockwaves through global markets and geopolitics. The move, condemned by China as a 'hegemonic act,' has disrupted Venezuela's oil industry, throwing foreign oil claims into uncertainty and prompting a surge in the US dollar amid rising geopolitical risks. While China faces short-term oil supply disruptions, its strategic reserves and stored crude may mitigate immediate impacts. The operation has also strained US-China relations, with Beijing warning of broader implications, including comparisons to Taiwan. Meanwhile, airlines cancel flights as the US closes Caribbean airspace, and businesses like Toyota adjust operations in Venezuela. Beyond Venezuela, tensions persist in other regions, with Ukraine's Nemiroff vodka maker expanding exports despite wartime challenges, and China leveraging trade restrictions—such as a ban on Japanese scallops—to signal displeasure over Taiwan-related diplomacy. Domestically, the US government grapples with the long-term effects of Trump's federal workforce reductions, while Wall Street reflects on unmet expectations for a 2025 dealmaking boom under his administration.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by AI-driven optimism and geopolitical shifts. TSMC shares surged after Goldman Sachs raised its price target by 35%, reflecting confidence in sustained AI demand, while emerging-market stocks neared record highs on tech sector gains. China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's top EV seller in 2025, as Tesla's deliveries slumped following the withdrawal of U.S. subsidies under Trump. Meanwhile, regulatory and trade tensions persist, with Europe considering a rollback of its 2035 combustion engine ban and the U.S. pausing a tech-focused trade deal with the UK over digital regulations. Venezuela emerges as a focal point for investment and geopolitical maneuvering, with hedge funds eyeing opportunities post-Trump's intervention, though oil giants remain silent on rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure. The AI boom continues to mint new billionaires, while China tightens regulations on AI chatbots amid IPO filings from startups like Minimax and Z.ai.
