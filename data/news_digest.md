## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about military activity in Pacific Ocean regions near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, raising concerns over regional stability. On the domestic front, former President Donald Trump makes financial moves, purchasing $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds after hinting at involvement in their merger approval, while his administration's aggressive stance on Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms. The entertainment industry also sees a shake-up as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking a shift in leadership for the 'Star Wars' franchise.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face headwinds as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts dominate the financial landscape. President Trump's threat of new tariffs on European countries over Greenland disputes weighs on risk sentiment, prompting the EU to halt approval of a key trade deal with the U.S. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve remains under scrutiny, with transcripts revealing past policy missteps and a Justice Department investigation into Chair Jerome Powell adding uncertainty. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: while HDFC Bank and Novo Nordisk exceed expectations, major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America report disappointing results amid Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. In commodities, central banks are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against volatility, while China's rare-earth exports decline amid rising tensions with Japan. The private credit boom in emerging markets gains momentum, with sovereign wealth funds diversifying away from U.S. assets, while Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 tourism push aims to reduce oil dependence.
