## 🌍 World & Politics

Tensions escalate as the U.S. tightens its grip on Venezuela’s oil industry, seizing two tankers—including a Russian-flagged vessel—and asserting control over the country’s crude sales after the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration’s aggressive moves, which include plans to ramp up military spending while cracking down on defense contractors, have rattled markets and drawn mixed reactions from conservative media. Meanwhile, China faces uncertainty over its oil investments in Venezuela, sparking internal debates about geopolitical strategy amid comparisons to Taiwan. Elsewhere, Iran’s president orders security forces to ease crackdowns on protesters, while Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka exporter Nemiroff, push forward despite ongoing war disruptions. The U.S. also closes Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks, as airlines scramble to adjust flights.
