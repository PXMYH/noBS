## ⚽ Sports

The Washington Post reverses its initial decision to skip on-site coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, announcing it will now send a small team of reporters just weeks before the Games begin. The abrupt shift follows widespread criticism of the paper's earlier plan to rely solely on remote reporting, underscoring the event's global significance. Meanwhile, in golf, Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf continues its controversial partnership with former President Donald Trump's properties, scheduling another tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This marks at least the sixth event the breakaway league has held at Trump-owned venues since 2022, further cementing their alliance amid ongoing scrutiny over LIV's financial ties to Saudi Arabia. The move comes as LIV Golf seeks to solidify its position in the sport, though it remains a polarizing force in professional golf.
