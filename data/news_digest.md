## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as Ukraine faces a massive Russian drone and missile attack, even as US, Russian, and Ukrainian officials continue negotiations in the UAE to seek a resolution to the prolonged conflict. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive economic policies take center stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he renounces liberal democratic principles, sparking concerns over US leadership in the global economy. His threats of new tariffs on European wine and renewed trade wars add to the uncertainty, while his push for US investment in Venezuela remains hampered by existing sanctions. Domestically, tens of thousands of Minnesotans stage a strike to protest ICE operations, demanding the agency’s removal from the state. In other developments, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT for financial security, while France’s President Macron makes headlines at Davos—not for policy, but for his stylish sunglasses covering a burst blood vessel.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattled investors. The S&P 500 logged its first two-week loss since June, driven by President Trump’s abrupt threats of tariffs on Europe and subsequent reversal, which triggered rapid selloffs and rebounds. Safe-haven assets surged, with silver topping $100 an ounce for the first time, while gold wagers hit a 16-week high amid concerns over Greenland and broader economic instability. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, boosting the yen and other currencies as traders speculated about potential Japanese currency intervention, possibly with U.S. support. Meanwhile, private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19% and warnings of a potential meltdown in the $3.4 trillion sector. Corporate activity remained brisk, highlighted by Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a blockbuster IPO, while AMC Entertainment’s debt talks spooked bondholders. Earnings reports were mixed, with Procter & Gamble beating estimates but missing on revenue, reflecting lingering consumer demand weakness. The Fed’s independence also came under scrutiny as the Supreme Court weighed Trump’s authority to dismiss central bank officials, adding to uncertainty over monetary policy.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire. The league announces it will host a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort, marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in the past four years. This partnership underscores LIV Golf’s strategy of aligning with high-profile venues and figures, despite ongoing political and ethical debates surrounding its Saudi funding. The move also highlights the league’s efforts to solidify its presence in the U.S. golf market, even as traditional tours like the PGA maintain their dominance. Meanwhile, the collaboration raises questions about the intersection of sports, politics, and business, as LIV Golf’s expansion remains a polarizing topic in the golf world.
