## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with bold geopolitical moves, including an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, citing welfare concerns. This sweeping restriction targets nations like Brazil, Iran, and Russia, escalating tensions over legal immigration pathways. Meanwhile, Trump's controversial push to assert control over Venezuela's oil resources faces skepticism, as analysts argue domestic production remains more viable and cost-effective. Critics warn his approach could undermine U.S. economic strength, drawing parallels to historical resource exploitation. Elsewhere, Canada seeks to diversify its trade relations, with former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney traveling to Beijing to repair strained ties with China amid worsening U.S.-China relations. The diplomatic effort underscores Canada's urgency to secure new markets as global trade dynamics shift.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are showing resilience amid economic uncertainty, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index hitting a record high above 33,000, driven by gains in tech and industrial stocks. However, Treasury yields rose after strong labor market data cast doubt on imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts, keeping investors cautious. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs outperformed expectations, buoyed by strong wealth management and asset divisions, while Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo faced pressure from weaker results and looming regulatory threats, including President Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates—a policy banks are fiercely resisting. Meanwhile, high-profile bankruptcies and M&A activity dominate headlines, with Saks Global filing for Chapter 11 after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus collapsed, leaving Amazon’s $475 million investment worthless. Elsewhere, Netflix is reportedly shifting to an all-cash offer to accelerate its $83 billion takeover of Warner Bros Discovery, while China’s record $1.19 trillion trade surplus underscores global economic tensions. Central bank independence remains a flashpoint, with Fed officials warning that political interference could reignite inflation, even as geopolitical risks like tariffs and AI disruption top business concerns.

## 💻 Technology

Tech and AI dominate headlines as TSMC's robust $56 billion capital spending plan for 2026 reignites confidence in the AI boom, lifting US stocks and easing concerns over the sector's longevity. Meanwhile, the Trump administration imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI325X, citing national security, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the blow. The move comes amid broader trade discussions, including a potential US-Taiwan deal that could see TSMC expand US manufacturing. Elsewhere, soaring memory prices create a 'crisis' for tech hardware firms like Apple, while data center demand remains strong despite supply concerns. Beyond tech, Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries, and the UK economy shows unexpected resilience with 0.3% November growth. However, Trump's manufacturing revival promises fall flat as job growth hits a five-year low, and labor tensions rise with union accusations of Nazi-like rhetoric from his administration.
