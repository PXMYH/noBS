## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian energy infrastructure by striking oil drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea, aiming to cripple Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making aggressive moves in Latin America, as President Trump pushes to secure Venezuela’s oil reserves—despite skepticism from major oil firms and concerns over political instability. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has eased border tensions with Guyana, a rising oil power, while China watches Washington’s regional power play warily, given its own deep economic ties in Latin America. Elsewhere, Greenland’s leadership firmly rejects Trump’s annexation proposals, and China’s diplomatic pressure on the UK over Taiwan underscores its assertive stance on sovereignty issues. Domestically, Trump seeks to tighten control over defense contractors and housing markets, signaling a broader push to reshape economic and military policies.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by significant developments in AI, regulatory shifts, and corporate strategy. Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, faces backlash as Malaysia and Indonesia block access due to sexually explicit content, while China investigates Meta’s acquisition of AI startup Manus over compliance concerns. Meanwhile, Asia’s AI race accelerates, with regional tech stocks outperforming U.S. peers, though Chinese AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. In corporate news, Boeing reports its highest airplane deliveries in seven years, while GM and Ford grapple with EV market challenges, including GM’s $7.1 billion writedown and Ford’s push into eyes-off driving tech. Regulatory and legal moves are also prominent, with U.S. lawmakers revisiting crypto legislation and JPMorgan dropping controversial proxy advisors in favor of AI-driven analysis. The labor market shows signs of slowing, with December job growth hitting a five-year low, while Trump’s policies—from credit card interest rate caps to Venezuela’s oil industry revival—spark debate.
