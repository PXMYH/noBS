## 🌍 World & Politics

The US's dramatic intervention in Venezuela, culminating in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, dominates global headlines, sparking sharp condemnation from China and raising geopolitical tensions. Beijing denounces the move as a 'hegemonic act,' signaling the end of 'Pax Americana,' while analysts warn of disruptions to Venezuela's oil industry, a critical supplier to China. The dollar strengthens amid rising uncertainty, and airlines cancel flights as the US closes Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks. Meanwhile, China's diplomatic tensions extend beyond Venezuela, with threats to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit and a ban on Japanese scallops as punishment for Tokyo's stance on Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on despite wartime challenges, while domestic US stories highlight the lingering impact of Trump's federal workforce cuts and Wall Street's unmet expectations for a 2025 dealmaking boom.
