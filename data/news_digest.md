## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is making bold moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, pushing for U.S. control over Venezuela’s oil reserves. Major oil companies remain hesitant to invest despite Trump’s $100 billion plan, citing political risks, though commodity traders like Vitol and Trafigura are exploring opportunities with U.S. refiners. The fall of Maduro eases tensions for Guyana, which holds vast oil reserves, while Mexico’s oil shipments to Cuba heighten U.S. concerns. Meanwhile, China watches closely as its economic influence in the region faces potential challenges from Trump’s aggressive policies. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing conflict, while the UK faces diplomatic strain with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit threatened trade talks.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets in early 2026 are shaped by geopolitical shifts, central bank caution, and sector-specific trends. The U.S. stock market, while still buoyed by AI optimism, is underperforming relative to international peers as investors diversify away from the dollar. Defense stocks are surging amid global instability, while gold remains a favored safe haven despite its record 2025 rally. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector—aiming to slash U.S. oil prices to $50 a barrel—faces skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which cite unresolved debt and investment risks. On the corporate front, a potential $260 billion merger between mining titans Rio Tinto and Glencore is gaining traction, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions. The Fed maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts, waiting for clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as Egypt and India signal potential easing amid stable inflation. In credit markets, Saks Global teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, and Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates draws sharp criticism from banks.
