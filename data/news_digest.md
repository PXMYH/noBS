## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies set to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. While Venezuela’s Supreme Court has granted temporary presidential powers to Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, the U.S. has effectively taken control, prompting Caracas to accuse Washington of an attack. The oil market, however, remains largely unaffected, with analysts suggesting global supplies can absorb any disruptions. Meanwhile, North Korea escalated tensions by launching ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, underscoring regional instability. In other diplomatic news, China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, while Japan faces economic retaliation from Beijing over its stance on Taiwan, including a ban on Japanese scallops. Domestically, the Trump administration’s restructuring of the federal workforce continues to draw scrutiny, with critics arguing it has weakened government efficiency.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism as Wall Street builds on its strongest year since 2009, fueled by tech gains and hopes of further Fed rate cuts. The S&P 500 inched higher, buoyed by semiconductor stocks and easing tariff concerns, though stretched valuations and inflation risks loom. Federal Reserve officials remain divided on the pace of future cuts, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson signaling modest reductions later in the year if economic conditions hold. Meanwhile, corporate activity is mixed: Saks Global’s CEO departure and potential bankruptcy underscore retail struggles, while SpaceX’s anticipated IPO could become the year’s biggest market event. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply after a record high, and oil fluctuating amid supply surplus fears. Geopolitical and policy risks—from Trump’s tariff policies to China’s silver export restrictions—add uncertainty to an otherwise bullish outlook.
