## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic maneuvers dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector drawing skepticism from U.S. oil executives and international observers. Despite Trump’s efforts to rally investment in Venezuela, major firms remain hesitant due to political instability and China’s entrenched economic influence in Latin America. Meanwhile, China is tightening oversight of its domestic tech sector, launching an antitrust probe into food-delivery giants like Meituan and Alibaba to curb price wars, signaling Beijing’s continued regulatory crackdown on market competition. In Europe, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejected Trump’s annexation claims, while the UK faced diplomatic backlash from China after a minister’s visit to Taiwan threatened key trade talks. On the military front, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff Vodka expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, underscoring the country’s determination to maintain economic activity amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with a mix of geopolitical tension and economic uncertainty, as the U.S. Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rattles investor confidence. Gold surges to a record high amid concerns over Fed independence and escalating protests in Iran, while U.S. stock futures dip alongside a weaker dollar. In Asia, emerging-market equities climb after a softer U.S. jobs report, though China’s economic challenges persist—its AI and robotics push fails to offset a slumping real estate sector, and battery stocks decline after Beijing cuts export tax rebates. Corporate developments dominate headlines, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks to create a $260 billion mining giant, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions, and Saks Global faces potential bankruptcy. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though Trump’s push for a 10% cap on credit card rates draws criticism from banks. Venezuela’s bonds emerge as a speculative hot trade, while Indonesia kicks off Asia’s sovereign dollar bond issuance for the year.
