## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as the U.S. captures Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise military operation, sending shockwaves through energy markets and geopolitical alliances. The move raises questions about Venezuela's oil future, with China's billions in loans to Caracas now in limbo, while investors like Michael Burry position for U.S. intervention in the country's oil sector. Meanwhile, China intensifies pressure on Japan, imposing military export controls and banning scallop imports over Tokyo's Taiwan stance, as Beijing's long-term strategy to dominate rare earths and assert regional influence faces new scrutiny. In Europe, France warns of a ballooning deficit amid budget deadlock, while the UK grapples with fallout from a minister's Taiwan visit that nearly derailed trade talks with China. Against this backdrop, Ukraine's war economy shows resilience, with businesses expanding despite ongoing conflict, even as oil markets fluctuate on potential peace deal progress.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weighed Federal Reserve policy shifts and geopolitical developments. The S&P 500 neared record highs, buoyed by signs of cooling service-sector activity that reinforced expectations of further Fed rate cuts, though a hawkish tilt among new FOMC voters could delay easing. Treasury yields reflected this divide, with the 10-year yield approaching 2025 highs relative to the two-year, signaling bets on looser monetary policy. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Charter Communications refinanced $1.75 billion in junk debt ahead of its Cox deal, while Warner Bros. Discovery faced a renewed takeover battle, with Netflix emerging as a potential frontrunner. Commodities saw volatility, with cotton hitting an eight-week high on supply concerns and gold edging up as traders looked past Venezuela’s political turmoil to U.S. economic data. Zambia’s kwacha rally continued after authorities curbed dollar usage, while China’s preliminary talks with Zambia on a currency swap underscored efforts to mitigate financial risks. In corporate earnings, JPMorgan strategists predicted a broadening of profit growth in 2026, driven by sustained AI capital expenditure, though Nvidia’s $4 trillion rally faced mounting threats. The year also began with notable restructuring: Saks Global’s CEO stepped down amid bankruptcy rumors, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting dissolved after federal funding cuts. Energy stocks surged on Venezuela-related bets, while Saudi Arabia’s move to open its stock market to all foreign investors aimed to boost inflows into the region’s largest equity market.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape kicks off 2026 with significant shifts in AI, energy, and global markets. Vista Equity Partners is making waves with its 'agentic factory' approach, redefining how companies integrate AI, while Nvidia's comments at CES send data-center cooling stocks tumbling amid concerns over demand. In the automotive sector, China's BYD surpasses Tesla as the world's top EV seller after Tesla's deliveries slump following the withdrawal of U.S. subsidies, signaling a competitive year ahead for electric vehicles. Meanwhile, energy giants like Shell and Chevron are expanding their footprints, with Shell acquiring a stake in Angola's oil blocks and Chevron eyeing opportunities in Venezuela amid political uncertainty. Financial markets remain volatile, with Citadel's flagship hedge fund posting a 10.2% gain in 2025, while private credit faces cooling confidence due to persistent high interest rates. Regulatory and legal battles also take center stage, as Ørsted challenges the U.S. government over a suspended wind farm project and the New York Times accelerates its lawsuit against the Pentagon over press restrictions.
