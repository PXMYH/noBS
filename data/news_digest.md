## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as China escalates its dispute with Japan by imposing export controls on military-related goods, retaliating for Tokyo’s remarks on Taiwan. The move follows Beijing’s earlier threats to cancel UK trade talks over a British minister’s Taiwan visit, underscoring China’s assertive stance on territorial issues. Meanwhile, the U.S.-led ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro sends shockwaves through global markets, with China reconsidering its oil deals with Caracas amid uncertainty over Venezuela’s future. The U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks, while airlines scramble to adjust flights. Domestically, President Trump’s defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting leads to its dissolution, marking another shift in his broader overhaul of federal agencies. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on despite wartime disruptions, symbolizing resilience amid ongoing conflict.
