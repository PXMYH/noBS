## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are navigating a volatile week as central banks and geopolitical tensions shape investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve and other major central banks are expected to hold interest rates steady, signaling caution amid economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, President Trump's unpredictable trade policies—including threats of tariffs on European wine and a sudden reversal on Greenland-related tariffs—have triggered sharp market swings, with the S&P 500 posting its first two-week loss since June. The dollar weakened significantly, benefiting the yen and emerging-market assets, while gold surged past $100 an ounce as investors seek safe havens. Corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's preparations for a potential $800 billion IPO. However, risks in private credit markets are rising, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19% and concerns growing over a potential meltdown in the $3.4 trillion sector. Retail traders continue to buoy stocks, while corporate earnings show mixed results, with Procter & Gamble beating estimates but facing shrinking demand.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid tightening U.S. export controls, while Big Tech's record $108.7 billion in bond issuances highlights the financial strain of funding AI ambitions. The IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with young workers facing the brunt of automation, though advisors to the ultra-rich dismiss AI as a game-changer for client acquisition. Meanwhile, TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about data privacy and app changes for its 200 million American users, as the platform updates its terms under new American ownership tied to Trump allies. Beyond tech, a winter storm disrupts travel with 13,000 flight cancellations, and mining stocks surge on AI-driven metals demand, signaling a potential supercycle.

Regulatory and legal battles are heating up, with the FCC cracking down on late-night TV political appearances and job applicants suing an AI recruitment tool company over alleged discriminatory algorithms. Netflix's ad revenue doubles to $3 billion, reflecting its pivot to advertising, while Paramount bets on European regulators to block a Warner Bros. Discovery-Netflix merger. In finance, Berkshire Hathaway prepares to exit its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz, marking a rare retreat for Warren Buffett, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent joins criticism of Fed Chair Powell, escalating tensions over monetary policy. The housing market falters as pending home sales drop sharply, and facial recognition expands at airports, balancing convenience with privacy concerns.",
