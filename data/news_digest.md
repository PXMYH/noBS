## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate this week's headlines, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in the punishment of 69 high-ranking officials, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued push to consolidate power and root out dissent within the Communist Party. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, with reports indicating she may suspend food sales taxes—a move likely aimed at bolstering public support ahead of elections. The Trump administration makes waves on multiple fronts, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting influence over Venezuela's oil sector, though U.S. energy giants remain hesitant to engage amid domestic production stability. On the security front, the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, reflecting rising tensions in the region. Domestically, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and signaling tighter government control over military media.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate earnings this week. In Asia, Hong Kong is strengthening financial ties with Shanghai through a gold exchange agreement, while China's rare-earth exports decline amid rising tensions with Japan. The Bank of Japan's upcoming meeting keeps yen traders on edge as investors speculate on rate hikes, complicated by looming elections. Meanwhile, the EU threatens to halt a trade deal with the U.S. over President Trump's tariff threats, adding to transatlantic trade strains. Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: HDFC Bank beats estimates on strong loan growth, while major U.S. banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo fall short as Trump's proposed 10% credit card rate cap looms. Novo Nordisk surges 8% on strong Wegovy sales, contrasting with Stellantis' struggles as it enters a critical 'year of execution.' The Fed remains in focus after 2020 transcripts reveal Jerome Powell's regrets over rate guidance, while Trump escalates pressure on the central bank, threatening legal action against JPMorgan and reshuffling the Fed chair race. Gold demand rises as central banks diversify reserves, reflecting waning confidence in the dollar.
