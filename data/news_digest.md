## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week. Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates pressure on foreign businesses by seizing Danish insulation manufacturer Rockwool’s assets, sending shockwaves through European markets. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive stance on Iran drives oil prices to a two-month high, amplifying concerns over potential supply disruptions and military intervention. His parallel push to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from domestic energy executives, who remain wary of the financial and political risks. In trade diplomacy, China signals a potential thaw with Canada, offering to ease restrictions on Canadian canola imports if Prime Minister Mark Carney relaxes tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles—a move that could reshape bilateral economic ties. Elsewhere, Beijing’s earlier threat to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit underscores its unyielding stance on territorial sovereignty, while Ukrainian businesses, including a bombed vodka producer, demonstrate resilience by expanding exports despite ongoing war.
