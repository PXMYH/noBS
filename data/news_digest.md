## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, former Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, emphasizes that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding Ukraine negotiations, while also addressing President Trump’s controversial threats to seize Greenland and his meeting with Zelenskiy. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive trade policies—including renewed tariffs on European wine and broader threats of a new trade war—spark concerns about U.S. economic leadership, with analysts warning that China stands to benefit as America retreats from the liberal democratic order. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations, accusing the agency of constitutional violations. In Venezuela, despite Trump’s interest in U.S. investment, sanctions continue to hinder business opportunities, pushing locals toward cryptocurrencies like Tether’s USDT to shield against economic instability. The Pentagon’s attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*—criticized as 'woke'—triggers pushback from Congress and the outlet’s leadership, highlighting ongoing debates over press freedom within the military.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets experienced significant volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and policy shifts dominated headlines. The S&P 500 posted its first two-week loss since June, driven by uncertainty over U.S. trade policy after President Trump abruptly reversed course on tariffs targeting Europe, sparking a synchronized selloff before a partial rebound. Safe-haven assets surged, with silver topping $100 per ounce for the first time and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high amid investor anxiety over Greenland and broader economic instability. Meanwhile, the dollar suffered its worst week since May, boosting emerging markets and commodities as traders diversified away from U.S. assets. In corporate news, Capital One announced a $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex, while SpaceX lined up Wall Street banks for a potential blockbuster IPO. The Fed faced renewed scrutiny over its independence, and private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19%. Japanese markets remained on edge as speculation grew over potential yen intervention, while AMC’s debt talks and Spirit Airlines’ bankruptcy negotiations underscored ongoing corporate distress.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire, announcing its latest tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This event marks at least the sixth time in four years that LIV Golf has hosted a competition at a Trump-owned property, underscoring the league’s strategic partnership with the Trump brand. The collaboration highlights LIV Golf’s efforts to secure high-profile venues as it competes with established tours like the PGA. Meanwhile, the league’s growing presence in the U.S. raises questions about its long-term impact on the golfing landscape, particularly as it attracts top talent and expands its schedule. Upcoming tournaments, including this New Jersey event, are expected to draw significant attention as LIV Golf solidifies its position in the sport.
