## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate the week as President Donald Trump pursues aggressive moves in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where he seeks to secure oil investments despite skepticism from major energy firms. His push for U.S. involvement in Venezuela’s resources faces resistance, with analysts warning of potential economic and diplomatic backlash, especially as China maintains its stronghold in the region. Meanwhile, Trump’s administration escalates pressure on defense contractors, demanding faster weapons production, while also proposing measures to curb Wall Street’s acquisition of single-family homes. Internationally, China flexes its diplomatic muscle, threatening to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit, while Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims. Domestic political friction continues as Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into a Middle East envoy, and a prediction market sparks controversy over bets on a U.S. invasion of Venezuela.
