## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as the Arctic emerges as a new battleground, with the U.S. eyeing Greenland for national security while Greenlanders push for independence. Meanwhile, China's internal military purge, marked by the ousting of top general Zhang Youxia, signals a major leadership shake-up under Xi Jinping, raising questions about the stability of the People's Liberation Army. On the trade front, President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China, further straining North American relations. The UK also tightens trade policies, reducing tariff-free steel imports amid a global glut and rising protectionism. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations, reflecting growing public resistance to immigration enforcement. Additionally, China-Japan relations sour as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo's remarks on Taiwan, underscoring regional tensions over the island's security.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are experiencing significant volatility as the dollar weakens amid growing speculation of U.S.-Japan currency intervention, while gold surges past $5,000 an ounce for the first time, driven by geopolitical uncertainty and investor flight from sovereign bonds. The yen strengthens on intervention risks, and emerging-market currencies, including the South Korean won, hit record highs as the dollar's decline accelerates. Meanwhile, China is expanding its influence in commodities by opening nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors, while Hong Kong doubles yuan supply to banks to bolster the currency's global use. Corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One acquiring fintech startup Brex for $5.15 billion and SpaceX lining up Wall Street banks for a potential blockbuster IPO. However, concerns over private credit risks and Fed independence loom, as Trump's aggressive policies—including a lawsuit against JPMorgan and pressure on the Federal Reserve—add to market unease. Small businesses show resilience with rising optimism, but trade tensions and economic policy shifts continue to disrupt global supply chains.

## ⚽ Sports

The sports world sees major developments as the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, with the Washington Post abruptly scrapping its coverage plans just weeks before the Games begin in Italy, signaling potential logistical or editorial challenges. Meanwhile, in golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf league continues its controversial partnership with former President Donald Trump’s properties, announcing a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort—marking at least the sixth event held at Trump-owned venues since the league’s inception. The move underscores LIV Golf’s strategic alignment with high-profile, politically connected venues amid ongoing debates about the league’s influence on the sport. Elsewhere, the sports media landscape faces uncertainty as outlets grapple with last-minute adjustments to major event coverage, while golf’s breakaway circuit solidifies its footprint in the U.S. with another Trump-branded event.
