## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with President Trump's aggressive trade policies and diplomatic retreats reshaping global dynamics. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's renouncement of liberal democratic principles leaves a leadership void, allowing China to assert greater influence in the global economy. Meanwhile, his threats of a new trade war escalate as courts consider limiting his tariff authority, creating uncertainty for international markets. Domestically, protests erupt in Minnesota as activists demand an end to ICE operations, alleging constitutional violations, while the Pentagon faces criticism over attempts to control the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, sparking a debate over press freedom within the armed forces. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against government volatility, even as U.S. sanctions complicate potential investment under Trump's administration. The week also saw lighter moments, with French President Macron's sunglasses becoming an unexpected talking point at Davos, overshadowing weightier geopolitical discussions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, corporate maneuvering, and shifting monetary policy. The dollar is posting its worst week since May amid unpredictable U.S. policymaking, while commodities like silver and copper surge—silver hitting $100 an ounce and copper topping $13,000 a ton—as investors seek safe havens. Meanwhile, corporate activity dominates headlines: Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech Brex underscores consolidation in financial services, while SpaceX’s reported $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO highlights the frothy private markets. President Trump’s $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and CEO Jamie Dimon adds to the political and economic uncertainty, as his administration’s trade policies and Fed criticism rattle markets. Elsewhere, TikTok’s deal to transfer U.S. operations to American investors ends years of regulatory drama, and UBS’s move to offer crypto trading signals growing institutional adoption of digital assets.
