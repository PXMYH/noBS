## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with oil markets reacting sharply to escalating pressures. Oil prices surged past $65 a barrel amid heightened U.S. actions against Iran and attacks on tankers near Russia’s Black Sea coast, exacerbating supply concerns. Meanwhile, President Trump’s push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector faces skepticism from major energy firms, wary of political instability and long-term risks. His broader Latin America strategy also draws scrutiny as China, already the region’s dominant economic player, monitors U.S. moves closely. In Europe, China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK flared after a minister’s Taiwan visit threatened key trade talks, underscoring Beijing’s assertive stance on sovereignty issues. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war disruptions, while Trump’s domestic focus on defense contractors signals a crackdown on delayed weapons deliveries.
