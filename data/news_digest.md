## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week’s headlines, with major developments in energy, trade, and diplomacy. Hungarian energy firm Mol Nyrt. is finalizing a deal to acquire a majority stake in Serbia’s sole refinery, as US sanctions force Russia’s Gazprom Neft to divest. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil resources faces skepticism from industry experts, who argue domestic production remains a more viable option. The move, criticized as economically outdated, underscores Trump’s aggressive stance on resource acquisition. In Europe, US Ambassador to Belgium Bill White calls for simplified EU regulations, reflecting ongoing transatlantic trade frictions. Elsewhere, Canada’s former central bank governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, seeking new markets amid worsening US-China ties. The UK also faces diplomatic fallout after China threatened to cancel trade talks following a minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting Beijing’s sensitivity over the issue. Despite ongoing conflicts, Ukrainian businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff continue to expand exports, demonstrating resilience amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Wall Street kicks off 2026 with strong earnings from major banks, as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup all surpass profit estimates, driven by robust trading activity and wealth management growth. The market's resilience is further highlighted by BlackRock's record $14 trillion in assets under management, fueled by surging ETF demand. However, volatility lurks beneath the surface, with individual stocks experiencing extreme swings despite overall market calm. Meanwhile, geopolitical and economic tensions dominate headlines, as China reports a record $1.19 trillion trade surplus, raising concerns about global trade imbalances. The World Economic Forum warns that economic conflicts between major powers pose the greatest near-term risk to businesses, while the Fed faces pressure from both political and market forces amid steady inflation at 2.7%. In corporate news, Saks Global's bankruptcy filing after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus underscores the challenges in retail, while Netflix's potential all-cash bid for Warner Bros Discovery signals a major shakeup in the streaming industry.

## 💻 Technology

The tech sector is riding a wave of optimism in early 2026, driven by AI advancements and strong earnings. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) delivered an upbeat outlook, propelling ASML to a $500 billion valuation and reviving confidence in AI-driven growth. However, soaring memory prices are creating challenges for hardware manufacturers like Apple, while South Korea narrows its sovereign AI competition, excluding major players like Naver and NCSoft. Meanwhile, regulatory and legal pressures are mounting, with Mastercard, Visa, and Revolut losing a UK lawsuit over cross-border fees, and India’s Supreme Court ruling against Tiger Global in a Flipkart tax dispute. Beyond tech, Britain’s offshore wind sector secures major contracts, while the U.S. explores expanding private sector roles in cyberwarfare. The labor market shows signs of weakness, with job growth slowing under Trump’s policies, and unionization efforts gain traction in unexpected sectors like bakery workers in New York.
