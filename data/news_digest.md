## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration continues to make bold moves on multiple fronts, with significant implications for both domestic and international affairs. Domestically, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over its editorial direction and alignment with Trump’s policies. Meanwhile, the State Department indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare use as justification—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations and draw criticism from affected nations. On the energy front, Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major oil companies, which may prefer domestic sources over the geopolitical and logistical risks of Venezuelan extraction. Internationally, Canada’s former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa’s effort to diversify trade partnerships amid worsening U.S.-China tensions. In entertainment, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy steps down, marking a leadership shift in the *Star Wars* franchise as two studio veterans take the helm.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are grappling with political and economic uncertainty as President Trump's policy proposals rattle key sectors. His call to cap credit card interest rates at 10% sent banking stocks tumbling, with major lenders like JPMorgan and Bank of America facing earnings pressure amid the threat of regulatory intervention. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's independence is under scrutiny, with Jerome Powell garnering support amid a DOJ investigation and Trump signaling hesitation over nominating Kevin Hassett as his replacement. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong early sales of its obesity drug Wegovy, while Clear Street closed a $12 billion pre-IPO funding round. Energy markets saw volatility, with European gas prices soaring 30% on cold weather and supply concerns, while oil recovered slightly on geopolitical tensions. Central banks are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against dollar instability, reflecting broader economic unease.
