## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions remain high as Ukraine launches its first bond sale since Russia's 2022 invasion, signaling cautious economic recovery, while Kyiv's drone strikes on Russia's Afipsky oil refinery underscore the ongoing conflict's energy warfare dimension. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warns of growing Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic, a concern echoed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Qatar's finance minister also emphasized energy resilience amid global instability. Domestically, the U.S. faces economic and political challenges: President Trump's tariff threats and potential trade wars loom as courts debate his authority, while Congress narrowly avoids a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape is dominated by high-stakes acquisitions, AI-driven economic shifts, and geopolitical tensions. Netflix's revised $83 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery signals a major consolidation in streaming, while the IMF highlights AI investment as a key driver of global growth, projecting a 3.3% expansion in 2026. Meanwhile, regulatory and legal battles intensify, with the U.S. Supreme Court reviewing Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and the White House threatening legal action against CBS over an unedited Trump interview. AI’s economic impact remains a double-edged sword, with surging demand for data centers inflating energy costs and prompting state-level pushback. Elsewhere, China’s demographic crisis deepens as birthrates hit historic lows, and BYD’s dominance in EVs underscores shifting global supply chains, particularly as the U.S. nears a trade deal with Taiwan to bolster domestic semiconductor production.
