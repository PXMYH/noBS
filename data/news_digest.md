## 🌍 World & Politics

Global oil markets fluctuate amid geopolitical tensions, with crude prices falling after President Donald Trump signals a potential pause in U.S. military action against Iran, citing assurances that Tehran will halt its crackdown on protesters. The shift eases earlier fears of escalation, though broader supply disruptions—including instability in Venezuela and the Black Sea—widen the discount of U.S. oil to the Brent benchmark, reflecting ongoing volatility in energy flows. Meanwhile, diplomatic maneuvering intensifies as Canada’s Prime Minister sends former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S. economic ties with China deteriorate. The move underscores growing efforts by Western nations to navigate complex relations with China, particularly after revelations that Beijing threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan earlier in the year. In Eastern Europe, Ukrainian businesses demonstrate resilience, with a leading vodka exporter expanding operations despite persistent Russian attacks, highlighting the country’s determination to sustain economic activity amid war.

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by high-stakes financial moves, regulatory shifts, and evolving market trends. Major IPOs from SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic could flood markets with capital, while Boeing outpaces Airbus in deliveries for the first time since 2018. Meanwhile, AI's rapid growth faces a reality check as a key U.S. grid operator scales back power demand forecasts, tempering expectations of an immediate infrastructure boom. In corporate news, JPMorgan reports lower 2025 earnings, and GM announces a $7.1 billion charge tied to EV restructuring, reflecting broader industry challenges. Regulatory and political developments also dominate, with the U.S. considering expanded private-sector roles in cyberwarfare and a potential Taiwan trade deal aimed at boosting domestic chip production. Elsewhere, Starlink provides free internet access in Iran amid a communications blackout, and a robotics startup, Skild AI, secures $1.4 billion to develop a universal 'brain' for robots, signaling continued innovation in automation.
