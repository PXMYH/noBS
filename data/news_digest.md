## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. The U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has sent shockwaves through oil markets, though prices remain surprisingly stable despite Venezuela's vast reserves. Analysts suggest the move reflects President Donald Trump's broader strategy to assert control over Venezuela's oil, though major energy firms remain hesitant to invest amid domestic alternatives. Meanwhile, Russia faces mounting economic pressure as oil and gas revenues plummet to a five-year low, undermining its war efforts in Ukraine. On the diplomatic front, Canada's former central bank governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S.-China tensions escalate. The Trump administration also tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Russia and Iran, citing welfare concerns. Critics argue Trump's aggressive resource grabs, like Venezuela's oil, could ultimately weaken U.S. economic influence rather than strengthen it.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Wall Street banks delivered mixed earnings this week, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley posting strong results in equities trading and wealth management, while Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo faced pressure from weaker consumer lending and looming regulatory threats. President Trump’s proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% has rattled the financial sector, prompting banks to strategize responses amid uncertainty over implementation. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s assets under management surged to a record $14 trillion, driven by ETF inflows, while Coinbase flexed its political muscle by blocking a Senate crypto bill, underscoring the industry’s growing influence in Washington. In corporate news, Saks Global filed for bankruptcy after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus collapsed, drawing legal pushback from Amazon, which saw its $475 million stake wiped out. Commodities markets saw volatility, with copper and silver retreating from recent highs, while China reported a record trade surplus, exacerbating global trade tensions. The Fed warned that undermining central bank independence could reignite inflation, as economic indicators showed persistent food price inflation and a slowdown in Peru’s copper-dependent economy.

## 💻 Technology

Tech and AI dominate headlines as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) delivers a strong earnings report, reigniting investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and pushing U.S. stocks near record highs. Meanwhile, President Trump imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X, citing national security concerns, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the impact. The move comes amid broader trade negotiations with Taiwan, where TSMC has pledged to expand U.S. manufacturing. In regulatory news, New York City sues food-delivery app Motoclick over alleged wage theft, signaling Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s aggressive stance on gig economy labor rights. Elsewhere, Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries for the first time since 2018, while JPMorgan Chase reports lower annual profits, raising questions about the bank’s future as CEO Jamie Dimon marks two decades at the helm. The tech sector also braces for a potential wave of mega IPOs in 2026, with SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic among the high-profile candidates poised to go public.

## 📰 Other News

This week’s news highlights a mix of economic shifts, corporate maneuvers, and social challenges shaping the U.S. and global landscape. The Trump administration’s indefinite suspension of immigrant visas from 75 countries marks a significant escalation in immigration policy, while rising food prices and housing affordability crises dominate domestic concerns. In corporate developments, Netflix is reportedly adjusting its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming assets to an all-cash deal, and Bombardier’s stock surged to a 23-year high after announcing a new Quebec factory. Meanwhile, social trends reveal growing strains, with seniors increasingly burdened as solo caregivers for aging partners and families cutting back on childcare due to soaring costs. The resurgence of prediction markets among younger users and the bumpy rollout of psilocybin therapy in legalized states also underscore evolving cultural and technological landscapes.
