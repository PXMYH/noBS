## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who is now detained in New York. President Trump has declared the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, while pledging American oil companies will rebuild the country’s struggling energy infrastructure. Financial markets are reacting cautiously, with Venezuelan bonds surging on hopes of regime change, though oil markets remain stable amid ample global supply. The operation has also disrupted regional airspace, prompting flight cancellations in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Western nations persist, as Beijing threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and imposed a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing war challenges, signaling resilience amid conflict.

Global markets are reacting to geopolitical tensions after the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, with gold and silver rising as safe-haven assets while oil prices decline amid uncertainty over Venezuela’s energy sector. Goldman Sachs suggests Venezuelan oil output could eventually increase, potentially pressuring crude prices long-term, though OPEC+ maintains its current supply strategy. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces internal divisions over further rate cuts in 2026, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson hinting at possible reductions later in the year. In corporate news, Saks Global is preparing for a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, seeking a $1 billion loan to stay afloat, while SpaceX’s anticipated IPO looms as a major market event. Investors remain cautious about AI-driven valuations and the Fed’s policy path, though Wall Street forecasts another strong year for stocks despite inflation and geopolitical risks.
