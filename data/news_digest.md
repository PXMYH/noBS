## 🌍 World & Politics

Global economic and political shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with China expanding its financial influence in the Gulf through record lending, solidifying its strategic ties in the region. Meanwhile, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, French President Emmanuel Macron’s appearance—marked by his now-famous sunglasses—overshadowed urgent geopolitical discussions, though the event underscored broader concerns about U.S. leadership under President Trump. Trump’s first year in office has sparked economic warnings, as his protectionist policies and threats of a new trade war raise fears of long-term damage to the U.S. economy, even as courts consider reining in his tariff authority. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency, particularly USDT, as a hedge against government volatility, highlighting the growing role of digital assets in unstable regimes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing a shift as geopolitical tensions ease and investors rotate away from U.S. assets. Stocks extended gains while the dollar weakened, lifting commodities like oil and gold to near-record highs. The Federal Reserve's independence remains a focal point, with the Supreme Court appearing likely to reject President Trump's attempt to fire a Fed governor, though his influence looms large over monetary policy. Corporate activity is brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and Singapore's $3.9 billion allocation to boost local stocks. Meanwhile, India continues to reduce its U.S. Treasury holdings, reflecting a broader trend of diversification among emerging economies. In earnings, Procter & Gamble beat estimates but reported weaker revenue, while Alaska Air offered a cautious 2026 outlook despite strong demand. Trump's legal and policy moves, including lawsuits against JPMorgan and proposed credit card rate caps, are adding volatility to financial sectors.
