## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warns of potential intervention to stabilize the yen, signaling rare coordination with the U.S. amid economic volatility. Meanwhile, U.S. domestic politics heat up as Senate Democrats threaten a government shutdown over Republican funding for Homeland Security, while mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations. On the international stage, President Trump's aggressive trade threats—including a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa engages with China—underscore a shifting global order, with analysts warning of China's rising influence as the U.S. retreats from traditional leadership roles. In Europe, France grapples with budget deficits, while Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against government instability.
