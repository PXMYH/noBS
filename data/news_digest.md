## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. has intensified its intervention in Venezuela, removing President Nicolás Maduro from power and seizing control of the country’s oil reserves. Chevron is accelerating oil shipments, while major traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore deals with U.S. refiners. The move has triggered a 124% rally in Venezuelan assets but raises concerns over legal and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, China faces uncertainty over its oil-backed loans to Venezuela, sparking domestic debates about Taiwan. Defense stocks surge amid heightened global tensions, and the U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, including a vodka exporter, press on despite ongoing war challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reacting to a mix of geopolitical developments and economic signals as 2026 begins. President Trump’s aggressive push to reshape housing policy—including a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase plan and a crackdown on institutional homebuyers—sparked volatility in real estate and mortgage-backed securities, while his controversial moves in Venezuela, aimed at securing oil supplies and lowering prices to $50 a barrel, sent energy stocks surging. Meanwhile, the Fed’s path remains in focus, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinting at a potential new Fed chair pick in January, even as Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggests limited room for further rate cuts. Corporate America is seeing shifts, with General Motors posting a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions, Saks Fifth Avenue teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. Investors are also rotating out of tech stocks into small caps and energy, while emerging-market currencies dip amid a stronger dollar and resilient U.S. economic data.
