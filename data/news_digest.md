## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate headlines this week, with significant actions from major powers. In China, an intensifying anti-corruption campaign sees 69 high-ranking officials punished, reinforcing President Xi Jinping’s ongoing crackdown on graft within the ruling party. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential economic shifts with a proposed temporary suspension of food sales tax—a move tied to her election campaign. In the U.S., the Trump administration tightens immigration policies by halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also making waves in corporate circles with Trump’s personal investment in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds following their merger announcement. Geopolitical tensions rise as the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and seeking greater Defense Department control.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank uncertainty, and corporate earnings this week. In Asia, Hong Kong is strengthening financial ties with China by signing an MOU with the Shanghai Gold Exchange, while China's rare-earth exports decline amid rising tensions with Japan. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's upcoming meeting has yen traders on edge as they speculate on potential rate hikes, complicated by looming elections. In the U.S., President Trump's threats to sue JPMorgan over alleged debanking and his push for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates are rattling financial institutions, with banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo reporting weak earnings amid regulatory pressures. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with newly released 2020 transcripts revealing Chair Jerome Powell's past policy missteps, while current Fed officials warn that undermining central bank independence could reignite inflation. Corporate highlights include Novo Nordisk's 8% stock surge on strong Wegovy sales, Stellantis' turnaround efforts, and Amazon's $475 million loss in the Saks-Neiman Marcus bankruptcy fallout. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 tourism push and the EU's 'Made in Europe' industrial policy signal shifting economic priorities, while gold demand rises as central banks seek hedges against dollar volatility.
