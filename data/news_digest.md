## 🌍 World & Politics

The dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces dominates global headlines, sparking immediate geopolitical and economic repercussions. Maduro pleaded not guilty in a U.S. court to narco-terrorism charges, setting the stage for a high-stakes legal battle with far-reaching implications. The move has rattled oil markets, with hedge funds increasing bullish bets on crude amid speculation of further U.S. intervention in Venezuela. Canada’s heavy crude prices slump, while Colombia’s bonds drop as regional tensions escalate between U.S. President Donald Trump and Colombian leader Gustavo Petro. Meanwhile, China faces uncertainty over its oil deals with Venezuela, with billions in loans to Caracas now in question. The U.S. has also closed Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks, disrupting flights as military operations unfold. Beyond Venezuela, China’s diplomatic tensions persist, with Beijing threatening to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and imposing a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff push forward despite ongoing war challenges, while global markets grapple with the broader fallout of Maduro’s ouster and its potential to reshape the global order.
