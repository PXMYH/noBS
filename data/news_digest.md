## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration continues to make bold moves on multiple fronts, with significant implications for both domestic and international affairs. In a controversial decision, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over its editorial direction and aligning it more closely with Defense Department priorities. Meanwhile, the administration indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare use as justification—a move likely to strain diplomatic relations and draw criticism from affected nations. On the economic front, Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, which appear hesitant to engage amid legal and logistical uncertainties, preferring domestic sources instead. Internationally, Canada seeks to pivot its trade strategy as former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa’s effort to diversify markets amid worsening U.S.-China tensions. In entertainment, Lucasfilm undergoes a leadership shakeup as Kathleen Kennedy steps down as president, marking a shift in the *Star Wars* franchise’s direction under new studio veterans.
