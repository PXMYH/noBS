## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intensifies its intervention in Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers and outlining plans to revive the country’s oil industry following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The move has sparked debates in China, where some view it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others warn of ideological risks. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s grain exports plummeted 25% in December amid escalating Russian strikes on port infrastructure, exacerbating global food supply concerns. In economic developments, President Trump’s proposal for a 50% increase in U.S. defense spending has sent defense stocks surging, signaling a year likely defined by military buildups and geopolitical conflict. Italy, however, insists its NATO-mandated defense spending hikes won’t come at the expense of social programs. Elsewhere, China’s oil deals with Venezuela face uncertainty post-Maduro, and the UK grapples with fallout from a minister’s Taiwan visit, which nearly derailed key trade talks with Beijing.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reacting to a mix of geopolitical shifts, central bank signals, and corporate maneuvers. Oil markets remain volatile as institutional investors turn bearish amid a supply glut, while Venezuela's political turmoil sends ripples through niche energy sectors and African credit markets. The U.S. trade deficit shrinks to its lowest since 2009, bolstered by tariffs, but Treasury yields slip ahead of key jobs data and potential legal challenges to trade policies. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve signals a dovish stance, with Governor Stephen Miran advocating for 150 basis points of rate cuts in 2026 to support the labor market, though Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggests limited further easing may be needed. Corporate activity is brisk, with JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, and Advent International in talks for a potential buyout of logistics firm InPost. Defense stocks surge on Trump’s proposed military budget hike, while tech shares waver, reflecting mixed economic signals. In real estate, shifting migration patterns and a balancing housing market hint at evolving demand, though institutional homebuyers face political scrutiny. Emerging markets face pressure as the dollar strengthens, and Venezuela’s debt and oil reserves become flashpoints for investors betting on political transitions.
