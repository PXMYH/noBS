## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, sparking geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. The Trump administration claims control over Venezuela’s oil reserves, though negotiations with the state-owned oil company remain unresolved. The U.S. has intensified its blockade, seizing two tankers—one Russian-flagged—while closing Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights. China, a major creditor to Venezuela, faces potential losses on billions in loans, fueling internal debates over whether Maduro’s ouster could serve as a template for Taiwan. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Ukraine’s Nemiroff vodka maker defies wartime challenges by expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks.

Global markets are bracing for volatility as traders await a pivotal U.S. jobs report and a potential Supreme Court ruling on President Trump’s tariffs, which could reshape trade dynamics. The Fed’s independence faces scrutiny amid political pressures, while Trump’s aggressive housing policies—including a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase—spark rallies in mortgage-backed securities and home-lender stocks. In corporate news, General Motors reports a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back EV ambitions, and Rio Tinto’s potential $200 billion merger with Glencore could create the world’s largest mining giant. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s oil sector dominates headlines as Trump seeks to leverage its reserves to slash U.S. oil prices, though experts remain skeptical about investor appetite. Asian markets show mixed reactions, with China’s inflation hitting a 34-month high driven by food costs, while MiniMax’s AI startup debuts strongly in Hong Kong.

## ⚽ Sports

Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is making waves off the court by advocating for NBA players to gain equity stakes in teams, arguing that current labor rules fail to reflect the league's massive financial growth. In a recent interview, the four-time All-Star and 2024 Finals MVP highlights the disparity between player contributions and ownership rewards, framing it as a broader issue of economic justice in professional sports. Brown, known for his activism and entrepreneurial ventures, suggests that players should share in the long-term value they help create, a stance that could spark broader discussions about revenue sharing and labor rights in the NBA. His comments come as the league continues to see record-breaking valuations and media deals, raising questions about how wealth is distributed among stakeholders.
