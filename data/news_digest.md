## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank policies, and corporate maneuvers this week. The Federal Reserve and other major central banks are holding interest rates steady, signaling caution amid economic uncertainty, while speculation grows about potential Fed leadership changes under President Trump. In Asia, Japan faces bond market volatility and currency intervention rumors as the yen weakens, while China’s stock market reflects a divide between export-driven industrial growth and sluggish domestic consumption. Corporate activity is brisk, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a blockbuster IPO, though private credit markets show signs of strain, including BlackRock’s 19% write-down in a debt fund. Meanwhile, Trump’s erratic trade policies—from reversing tariff threats to suing JPMorgan—continue to rattle markets, while retail investors defy Wall Street’s bearish sentiment by buying dips.

## 💻 Technology

This week's tech and business landscape is dominated by AI's growing influence and its economic ripple effects. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid tightening U.S. export controls, while Big Tech's record $108.7 billion in bond issuances highlights the financial strain of funding AI ambitions. Meanwhile, the IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with young workers facing the brunt of automation—particularly in entry-level roles. TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S., including updated terms and a new American-led entity, reflects ongoing geopolitical tensions, though users may see minimal immediate changes. Beyond tech, a winter storm wreaks havoc on travel, canceling 13,000 flights, while U.S. automakers face setbacks in Canada as trade policies push the country toward Chinese carmakers. Mining stocks surge as AI-driven demand for critical metals sparks talk of a new supercycle, though environmental concerns loom over accelerated seabed mining permits.
