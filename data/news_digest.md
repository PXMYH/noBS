## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro marks a major geopolitical shift, with the Trump administration moving to control the country’s vast oil reserves. Chevron is accelerating oil shipments from Venezuela, while the U.S. tightens its blockade by seizing tankers, including a Russian-flagged vessel. The move has sparked global reactions, with China debating its implications for Taiwan and investors scrambling to assess the fallout. Meanwhile, defense stocks surge amid heightened tensions, and airlines cancel flights as the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace. Domestic political developments include Democratic lawmakers calling for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump pushing Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

{
    "summary": "Markets are reacting to a mix of geopolitical developments and economic signals as 2026 begins. The U.S. trade deficit has shrunk to its smallest since 2009, driven by tariffs and a drop in imports, while Treasury yields slip ahead of Friday’s jobs report. Investor attention is also fixed on Venezuela, where President Trump’s plans to leverage the country’s oil reserves—aimed at driving crude prices to $50 a barrel—have sparked volatility in energy stocks and bonds, though Wall Street largely shrugs off broader geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces pressure as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hints at a potential Fed Chair pick this month, with rates still seen as restrictive. Corporate moves include JPMorgan’s takeover of the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs and the dissolution of a boutique muni restructuring firm, while the housing market shows signs of balancing after years of investor dominance.

In other developments, the White House is considering bipartisan nominees for the CFTC, and Czech defense firm CSG is preparing for an Amsterdam IPO. Private equity firms emphasize discipline amid a shifting dealmaking landscape, and New Fortress Energy seeks more time to restructure its debt. The closure of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting underscores ongoing media industry struggles, while Berkshire Hathaway transitions leadership as Warren Buffett steps down.",
