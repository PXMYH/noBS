Algorithmic traders turn bullish on oil as Trump’s rhetoric against Iran escalates, while his push to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from US energy executives, who fear exacerbating an already oversupplied market. Meanwhile, China leverages trade negotiations to ease Canadian EV tariffs in exchange for rapeseed relief, highlighting Beijing’s strategic use of economic pressure.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with Aldi and other value-focused retailers drawing shoppers away from traditional supermarkets. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push consumers across income levels to prioritize affordability without sacrificing quality. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further intensifying pressure on established grocers to adapt. The expansion also signals confidence in the discounter's long-term growth, with plans to strengthen its footprint in both urban and suburban markets.
