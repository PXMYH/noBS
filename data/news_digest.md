## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate headlines as President Trump escalates threats of a new trade war, even as courts weigh limiting his tariff authority. His first year in office leaves economists warning of long-term economic weakening, while his controversial stance on Venezuela—where he has declared himself 'acting president'—faces skepticism from major oil companies reluctant to invest amid instability. Meanwhile, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though domestic unrest persists as Minnesota braces for an economic blackout protesting ICE operations following a high-profile killing. Internationally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity over Latin American waters, while Venezuela’s economic collapse drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against instability. These developments underscore deepening divisions over immigration, trade, and foreign intervention, with Trump’s aggressive policies shaping both domestic and global landscapes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, with U.S. and European stocks posting their worst session in months after President Trump's threats of new tariffs over Greenland sparked fears of a trade war. The S&P 500 dropped over 2%, erasing its 2026 gains, while gold surged to a record high above $4,700 an ounce as investors sought safe havens. The dollar weakened, and Treasury yields rose amid a selloff in Japanese bonds, compounded by concerns over Japan's fiscal policies and a 'dementia money' crisis threatening trillions in assets. Meanwhile, corporate earnings and deals are making headlines: Netflix reported strong fourth-quarter results but issued a cautious forecast due to increased content spending and its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while drone delivery startup Zipline hit a $7.6 billion valuation after raising $600 million. The Federal Reserve remains in focus as Trump considers replacing Chair Jerome Powell, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinting a decision could come next week, adding to market volatility.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape is dominated by high-stakes acquisitions, AI advancements, and geopolitical tensions. Netflix's revised $83 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery signals a major shift in the streaming wars, while OpenAI's introduction of ads in ChatGPT underscores the monetization push in AI. Meanwhile, global markets face volatility amid Trump's Greenland standoff with Europe and escalating tariffs, with copper prices surging to 2021 levels. AI remains a key driver of economic growth, as the IMF highlights its role in boosting global output, while smaller firms challenge Big Tech in AI-driven sectors like data centers and retail automation. Regulatory and legal battles also take center stage, from CBS's delayed '60 Minutes' segment on Venezuelan deportations to lawsuits over vaccine policies and student loan collections.
