## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines as President Trump's policies continue to reshape international relations. At the World Economic Forum, Trump's renouncement of liberal democratic principles and threats of a new trade war signal a shift in U.S. leadership, leaving a vacuum that China appears poised to fill. Meanwhile, Argentina's President Javier Milei defends his country's deepening trade ties with China while seeking a parallel deal with the U.S., highlighting the complex balancing act smaller nations face amid great power competition. In Europe, defense industry leaders like Fincantieri's CEO call for greater coordination in military spending as geopolitical risks mount, underscoring the continent's urgency to bolster its security infrastructure. Domestically, the U.S. avoids a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though economic warnings persist about the long-term consequences of Trump's policies. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies like USDT as economic instability worsens, reflecting broader trends in countries grappling with political turmoil.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded Thursday after President Trump backed away from imposing new tariffs on European countries, easing trade tensions that had rattled investors earlier in the week. The shift lifted European stocks, while oil prices declined as focus returned to supply outlooks. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's independence remains a flashpoint, with the Supreme Court appearing likely to reject Trump's attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, though concerns persist about political pressure on monetary policy. In corporate news, Procter & Gamble posted mixed earnings, Spirit Airlines entered takeover talks with Castlelake, and Paramount extended its tender offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. At Davos, leaders like Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto and Argentina's Javier Milei touted economic growth prospects, while BlackRock's emerging-market ETF saw record inflows as investors rotate away from U.S. assets. Elsewhere, China's real estate slump continues to weigh on growth, and Benin returned to the bond market amid improving sentiment.
