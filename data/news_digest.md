## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signals potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales, while major trading firms like Vitol and Trafigura explore partnerships with US refiners. However, oil executives remain cautious about investing in Venezuela despite Trump’s $100 billion plan, citing political and financial risks. The fall of Maduro also eases tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from its oil-rich Essequibo region. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the US expands its influence in a region where Beijing has long held economic dominance. Elsewhere, Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation proposals, and the UK faces diplomatic strain with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit nearly derailed trade talks. Domestic issues in the US include Trump’s push for new powers to pressure defense contractors and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as inflation trends show signs of stabilization, though risks linger beneath the surface. U.S. inflation remains subdued, reinforcing expectations of gradual Fed rate cuts, while Egypt's steady inflation raises hopes for further monetary easing. However, corporate bond markets face pressure, with a growing number of investment-grade issuers teetering on the brink of junk status, exemplified by Saks Global's struggles to secure financing amid potential bankruptcy. Meanwhile, geopolitical and commodity markets are in flux as President Trump's aggressive push to nationalize Venezuela's oil industry sparks skepticism from major energy firms like Exxon, which deem the country 'uninvestable' without significant reforms. Defense stocks surge in Europe and Asia amid global instability, while gold investors remain bullish after a record 2025 rally, betting on sustained safe-haven demand. In corporate news, BlackRock forecasts a continued AI-driven bull market but advises targeted bets, while a potential $260 billion merger between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore reignites after years of failed talks. The U.S. trade deficit hits its lowest level since 2009, reflecting the impact of Trump's tariff policies, though concerns grow over the Fed's independence as political pressures mount.
