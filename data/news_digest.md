## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global financial markets are navigating a tense period as central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, signal a pause on interest rate changes amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The Fed's cautious stance comes as President Trump's unpredictable trade policies—including threats of 200% tariffs on European wine and abrupt reversals on tariffs—continue to rattle markets, sparking volatility in stocks, bonds, and currencies. The S&P 500 posts its first two-week loss since June, while silver surges past $100 an ounce, reflecting shifting investor sentiment. Meanwhile, corporate America faces mixed fortunes: Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex highlights dealmaking momentum, while BlackRock's 19% write-down in a private debt fund underscores growing concerns about the $3.4 trillion private credit market. In Washington, Trump's escalating feud with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon—culminating in a $5 billion lawsuit—adds to the strain between the administration and Wall Street, even as the Supreme Court weighs the limits of presidential power over the Fed.
