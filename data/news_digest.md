## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as the U.S. intensifies its intervention in Venezuela, seizing oil tankers and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration claims an agreement with Venezuela’s government, though state-owned oil company PDVSA states negotiations are ongoing. The move has sparked global reactions, with China debating its implications for Taiwan and investors like Michael Burry positioning for shifts in the oil market. Meanwhile, Iran faces internal unrest as President Masoud Pezeshkian orders security forces to avoid targeting peaceful protesters amid deadly crackdowns. In the U.S., Trump pushes for legislative action to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes and vows to crack down on defense contractors’ executive pay while proposing a $1.5 trillion military budget. The FAA’s closure of Caribbean airspace due to the Venezuela operation disrupts flights, underscoring the broader regional impact of the crisis.
