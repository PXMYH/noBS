## 🌍 World & Politics

President Donald Trump is making aggressive moves to reshape Venezuela’s oil sector following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, pushing U.S. energy executives to invest in the country’s vast reserves. However, major oil companies remain hesitant due to political instability, sanctions uncertainty, and competition from China and Russia, which maintain strong economic ties in the region. The administration’s plans, including potential oil sales agreements, face skepticism from industry leaders, though hedge funds are growing bullish on oil amid escalating unrest in Iran and Venezuela’s shifting dynamics. Meanwhile, Trump’s broader geopolitical strategy in Latin America is drawing scrutiny, with China closely monitoring U.S. actions as it seeks to protect its own interests in the region. Elsewhere, tensions flare as Greenland rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring the fragile state of international relations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with a risk-on rally, as U.S. stocks surged to fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, December’s jobs report tempered immediate rate-cut bets, with traders now pricing in a more cautious Fed approach. The dollar remained resilient despite geopolitical tensions, while gold edged higher as investors weighed mixed economic signals. In corporate news, General Motors reported a $7.1 billion loss tied to its EV pullback, and Rio Tinto and Glencore revived merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining company. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s oil sector took center stage as Trump pushed for U.S. investment, though industry leaders like Exxon called the country ‘uninvestable’ without major reforms. The week also saw strong IPO activity, with Aktis Oncology jumping 24% in its debut, and Goldman Sachs highlighting utilities as a key sector for 2026.
