## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals in early 2026, with geopolitical shifts and central bank policies driving key trends. The Trump Organization and Dar Global Plc are launching $10 billion in Saudi real estate projects, capitalizing on new foreign investment rules, while Venezuela’s bonds surge following Nicolás Maduro’s ouster, shrinking distressed debt opportunities. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve remains cautious on rate cuts despite steady inflation, with December’s jobs data reinforcing a wait-and-see approach. Corporate activity is heating up, as Rio Tinto and Glencore restart merger talks to create a $260 billion mining giant, and JPMorgan Chase takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. However, challenges persist: General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back EV ambitions, and Saks Global struggles to secure financing amid potential bankruptcy. Gold investors remain bullish after a record 2025 rally, while defense stocks gain traction amid global instability. In consumer trends, Gen Z investors shift from meme stocks to index funds, and China’s experience economy shows resilience despite flat prices.
