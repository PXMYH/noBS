## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as President Trump's aggressive trade policies and geopolitical maneuvers dominate headlines. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump renounces liberal democratic principles, signaling a shift in U.S. global leadership that analysts say benefits China. His threats to impose new tariffs on European wine and seize Greenland, discussed with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, further strain transatlantic relations. Meanwhile, domestic unrest grows as tens of thousands in Minnesota stage protests against ICE, demanding the agency's removal from the state amid allegations of constitutional violations. In Venezuela, economic instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins as a hedge against government volatility, even as Trump expresses interest in U.S. investment there—though sanctions complicate any potential deals. The Pentagon's criticism of *Stars and Stripes* as 'woke' sparks a debate over military media independence, while France's Macron makes headlines for a more trivial reason: his sunglasses at Davos.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets faced heightened volatility this week as geopolitical tensions and unpredictable U.S. policymaking rattled investors. The S&P 500 posted its first two-week loss since June, with silver surging past $100 an ounce and gold wagers hitting a 16-week high as traders sought safe havens. The yen staged its biggest one-day jump since August amid speculation of Japanese currency intervention, while the dollar suffered its worst week since May. Meanwhile, the Fed's delayed inflation data showed sticky price pressures, keeping monetary policy in focus. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's reported $800 billion valuation ahead of a potential IPO. However, private credit markets showed signs of strain, with BlackRock marking down a debt fund by 19% and AMC bondholders engaging in restructuring talks. Trump's erratic trade policies—including a sudden reversal on European tariffs and a lawsuit against JPMorgan—added to market uncertainty, while his potential Fed chair pick, Rick Rieder, gained traction.

The tech sector is buzzing with major developments, led by Tesla's bold move to deploy fully autonomous robotaxis in Austin without safety drivers, marking a significant leap in self-driving technology. Meanwhile, Apple signals a potential leadership transition by expanding hardware chief John Ternus' role to include design, positioning him as a top contender to succeed CEO Tim Cook. In AI, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled chip sales amid geopolitical tensions, while the IMF warns of an AI 'tsunami' disrupting labor markets, with young workers facing the brunt of job displacement. Regulatory shifts are also making waves, as TikTok updates its U.S. terms following a corporate restructuring to distance itself from Chinese ownership, though questions linger about potential app changes for American users. Elsewhere, Big Tech's record $108.7 billion bond issuance in Q4 highlights the financial risks companies are taking to fuel AI ambitions, even as critics warn of broader economic implications.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire. The league announces it will host a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort, marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in the past four years. This partnership underscores LIV Golf’s strategy of aligning with high-profile venues and figures, despite ongoing political and ethical debates surrounding its Saudi funding. The move also highlights the league’s efforts to solidify its presence in the U.S. golf market, even as traditional tours like the PGA maintain their dominance. Meanwhile, the collaboration raises questions about the intersection of sports, politics, and business, as LIV Golf’s expansion remains a polarizing topic in the golf world.
