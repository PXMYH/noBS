## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic political shifts dominate global headlines. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces mounting pressure amid a corruption scandal, prompting outreach to potential rivals as calls for elections grow louder. Meanwhile, China intensifies its anti-corruption drive, punishing 69 high-ranking officials in 2025, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares for a snap election, considering a temporary suspension of food sales tax to bolster her campaign. The U.S. remains a focal point, with the Trump administration halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, citing welfare concerns, while also warning of heightened military activity in Latin American airspace. Venezuela, under Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, secures its first LPG export deal, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage despite Trump's interest in the country's resources.
