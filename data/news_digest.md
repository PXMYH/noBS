## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as the U.S. consolidates control over Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, with President Trump pushing for American oil companies to invest in the country’s energy sector. However, major oil executives remain hesitant due to political instability and uncertainty, even as hedge funds grow bullish on oil amid disruptions in Venezuela and Iran. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the U.S. expands its influence in Latin America, where Beijing has long held economic dominance. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejects Trump’s renewed calls for annexation, while the UK faces diplomatic strain with China after a minister’s visit to Taiwan nearly derailed trade talks. In Hong Kong, the government rules out reusing a fire-ravaged housing estate, and Ukrainian businesses, including a vodka exporter, press on despite ongoing war challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a bullish tone, as U.S. stocks hit fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. The December jobs report, showing slower payroll growth, reinforced the Fed’s cautious stance, with officials seeking clearer signs of rising unemployment before easing policy further. Meanwhile, corporate earnings revealed mixed fortunes: General Motors posted a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, while IMAX thrived in 2025 by capitalizing on shifting consumer trends. In dealmaking, Rio Tinto and Glencore revived merger talks, potentially creating the world’s largest mining company, while JPMorgan Chase struck a deal to take over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. Geopolitical and economic policy moves also dominated headlines, with President Trump pushing aggressive measures to lower oil prices by leveraging Venezuela’s crude reserves—a plan met with skepticism from energy executives. India’s 7.4% GDP growth drew attention, though analysts warned of underlying weaknesses, while Switzerland’s flexible labor market continued to bolster its economic resilience.
