## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warns of potential intervention to stabilize the yen, signaling rare coordination with the U.S. amid economic volatility. Meanwhile, U.S. domestic politics heat up as Senate Democrats threaten a government shutdown over funding disputes tied to immigration enforcement, while mass protests in Minnesota demand ICE's withdrawal from the state. On the trade front, President Trump's aggressive tariff threats—including a 100% levy on Canadian imports if Ottawa engages with China—underscore a rising protectionist tide, mirrored by the UK's planned steel tariff hikes. Diplomatic strains deepen as China-Japan relations sour over Taiwan, with Chinese tourism to Japan plummeting, while Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against government instability. Chrystia Freeland, now advising Ukraine, frames the war's future as dependent on Putin's next moves, even as Trump's erratic policies—from seizing Venezuelan oil to renouncing global leadership—further fracture international alliances.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic shifts, with President Trump's unpredictable trade policies—including tariff threats and reversals—dominating headlines. The Federal Reserve and other central banks signal a cautious stance on interest rates, holding steady amid inflation concerns, while investors flock to high-risk junk bonds, reflecting confidence in low corporate defaults. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust: Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex highlights M&A momentum, and SpaceX's potential IPO, valued at $800 billion, underscores the tech sector's resilience. In Asia, Saudi Arabia's property market opens to foreign investors, boosting developer stocks, while China's stock market diverges between industrial exporters and struggling consumer firms. Small businesses in the U.S. show surprising optimism, but risks loom in private credit markets and potential Fed overreach under political pressure.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's upcoming visit to China underscores the company's push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid tightening U.S. export controls. Meanwhile, TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about data privacy and app functionality, as the platform spins off its American operations under new ownership.

In mining, a new U.S. rule accelerates deep-sea mineral extraction, fueling a potential supercycle as AI-driven demand for metals surges. Elsewhere, Paramount bets on European regulators to block a Warner Bros. Discovery-Netflix merger, while Netflix's ad revenue strategy shows early success, doubling projections for 2026.
