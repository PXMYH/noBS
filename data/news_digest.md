## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week, with President Trump's aggressive push into Venezuela taking center stage. After ousting Nicolás Maduro, the U.S. is seeking to secure Venezuela's oil reserves, though major oil executives remain hesitant due to political instability and financial risks. Analysts warn Trump's plan could backfire, weakening U.S. economic influence while China, already deeply embedded in Latin America as the region's top lender, watches closely. Meanwhile, Greenland's labor leader firmly rejected Trump's annexation claims, underscoring Arctic sovereignty concerns. In Asia, China's antitrust probe into food-delivery giants like Meituan and Alibaba signals Beijing's effort to curb cutthroat competition, while earlier diplomatic tensions with the UK over Taiwan resurface, revealing Beijing's readiness to leverage trade talks as political pressure. Elsewhere, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff vodka expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, highlighting the country's determination to sustain its economy amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with uncertainty as political and economic pressures intensify. The U.S. Federal Reserve faces unprecedented scrutiny after the Justice Department issued subpoenas to Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns about central bank independence and triggering a 'Sell America' sentiment in markets. Gold and silver prices surged to record highs amid the turmoil, while U.S. stock futures and the dollar weakened. Meanwhile, China's economic challenges persist, with its AI and robotics push failing to offset the real estate slump, and battery stocks dropping after Beijing announced plans to cut export tax rebates. Corporate shakeups are also making headlines, including Heineken's CEO stepping down due to slumping beer sales and Deutsche Bank's India retail assets attracting final bids from local lenders. In M&A news, mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore have restarted merger talks, potentially creating the world's largest mining company, while JPMorgan Chase is set to take over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. The housing market shows signs of balancing, but Trump's policies—such as a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates and a push for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds—are sparking debate over their economic impact.
