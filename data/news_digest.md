    "summary": "The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily administer Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies slated to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. The move has prompted Venezuela’s Supreme Court to grant temporary presidential powers to Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, while global oil markets remain largely unaffected despite Venezuela’s vast reserves. Meanwhile, tensions in East Asia escalate as North Korea launches ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, underscoring regional instability. Diplomatic frictions also persist between China and the UK, with Beijing threatening to cancel trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, and Japan facing economic retaliation from China over its stance on Taiwan. Domestically, the Trump administration’s restructuring of the federal workforce continues to draw scrutiny, with critics arguing it has weakened government efficiency.",

    "summary": "Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism, as the S&P 500 inched higher amid mixed signals. Semiconductor stocks led gains, buoyed by anticipation for the CES conference and easing concerns over Trump’s tariff policies, though stretched valuations and inflation risks linger. The Fed faces a divided path forward, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson hinting at potential rate cuts later in the year, while minutes from the December meeting revealed deep splits among officials over whether inflation or unemployment poses the greater threat. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Saks Global replaced its CEO as bankruptcy rumors swirled, while private equity firm Oakley Capital explored a £500 million sale of London estate agency Dexters. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply from record highs and oil fluctuating amid supply surplus concerns. Ethiopia also struck a deal-in-principle with bondholders to restructure $1 billion in defaulted debt, offering a rare bright spot in emerging markets.",
