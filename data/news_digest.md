## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as Mexico delivers a significant oil shipment to Cuba, defying U.S. pressure amid the fallout from Venezuela’s political upheaval. The Trump administration is aggressively pursuing control of Venezuela’s oil reserves, meeting with hesitant energy executives and proposing a $100 billion investment plan, though major firms remain wary due to instability and competing interests from China and Russia. Meanwhile, China asserts its dominance in Latin America, monitoring U.S. moves closely, while Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims. In other developments, hedge funds grow bullish on oil amid Venezuela’s turmoil and Iran’s protests, and the U.S. outlines plans for Venezuela’s oil sales despite conflicting reports from Caracas. Domestically, Trump pushes for new powers to pressure defense contractors and calls on Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases, while Democratic lawmakers seek an investigation into a Middle East envoy.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a risk-on rally, as U.S. stocks surged to fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Fed's cautious stance persists, however, with December's jobs report showing slowing payroll growth, suggesting officials will wait for clearer signs of rising unemployment before easing further. Meanwhile, corporate America delivered mixed results: General Motors posted a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, while IMAX thrived in 2025 by capitalizing on shifting consumer trends. In dealmaking, Rio Tinto and Glencore restarted merger talks that could create the world's largest mining company, while JPMorgan Chase took over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking the latter's retreat from consumer banking. Geopolitical and energy markets remained volatile, with President Trump pushing to unlock Venezuela's oil reserves—a move met with skepticism from oil executives citing political risks and unpaid debts. India's economy grew at 7.4%, though analysts warned of underlying weaknesses, while China promoted its duty-free Hainan island amid a $1 trillion trade surplus. The housing market showed signs of balancing, though Trump's mortgage bond initiative and tariff policies continued to reshape trade and real estate dynamics.
