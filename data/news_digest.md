## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as the U.S. solidifies its influence in Latin America following the capture of Venezuela’s former President Nicolás Maduro. President Trump pushes for American investment in Venezuela’s oil sector, though major oil executives remain hesitant due to political instability. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipment to Cuba escalates U.S.-Cuba tensions, while China watches Trump’s Latin America strategy closely, given its deep economic ties in the region. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into a U.S. Middle East envoy. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite ongoing conflict, while China’s threat to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit underscores rising diplomatic friction.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a risk-on rally, as U.S. stocks hit fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. The December jobs report, showing slower payroll growth, reinforced the Fed’s cautious stance, though officials signal they need clearer signs of rising unemployment before easing further. Meanwhile, corporate earnings revealed mixed fortunes: General Motors posted a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, while IMAX outperformed rivals in the theater sector. In dealmaking, Rio Tinto and Glencore revived merger talks, potentially creating the world’s largest mining company, and JPMorgan Chase struck a deal to take over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. Geopolitical and energy markets remained in focus as President Trump met with oil executives to discuss Venezuela’s vast crude reserves, though industry leaders like Exxon’s CEO called the country ‘uninvestable’ without major reforms. India’s economy grew at 7.4%, though analysts warned of underlying weaknesses, while China promoted its duty-free Hainan island amid a $1 trillion trade surplus. Credit markets saw volatility, with Saks Global struggling to secure financing ahead of a potential bankruptcy, and Venezuela’s bonds becoming a hot but risky trade on Wall Street.
