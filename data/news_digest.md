## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week's headlines, with Venezuela at the center of U.S. and Chinese strategic interests. President Trump's aggressive push to secure Venezuela's oil reserves faces skepticism from major oil executives, who remain wary of political instability and legal risks. Meanwhile, China, already a dominant economic force in Latin America, watches Trump's moves closely, reinforcing its long-standing influence in the region. In a diplomatic win, Venezuela releases two Italian prisoners, easing tensions with Italy, while Greenland firmly rejects Trump's annexation claims, underscoring Arctic sovereignty concerns. On the economic front, China's antitrust probe into food-delivery giants like Meituan and Alibaba signals Beijing's effort to curb aggressive price wars, boosting investor confidence. Elsewhere, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Ukraine's Nemiroff vodka maker defies wartime challenges by expanding exports, highlighting resilience amid ongoing conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with heightened uncertainty as political pressures on the Federal Reserve escalate, with the U.S. Justice Department issuing subpoenas to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns over central bank independence. The threat of criminal indictment has rattled investors, sending U.S. stock futures lower and pushing gold to record highs amid safe-haven demand. Meanwhile, emerging markets show resilience, with Asian equities climbing after a softer U.S. jobs report, while Indonesia prepares to issue the first Asian sovereign dollar bond of 2026, signaling strong appetite for debt issuance. Corporate activity remains robust, highlighted by Deutsche Bank’s $2.5 billion India retail asset sale drawing final bids from local lenders, and mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining company. In China, despite efforts to boost AI and robotics, economic growth remains vulnerable to trade risks, with battery stocks declining after export tax rebate cuts. The housing market shows signs of stabilization in the U.S., though General Motors’ $7.1 billion loss underscores challenges in the EV sector as policy shifts dampen demand.
