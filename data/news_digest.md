## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant volatility as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty drive investors toward safe-haven assets. Gold surges past $5,100 an ounce, hitting record highs alongside silver, as traders react to Trump’s threat of 100% tariffs on Canada and fears of a U.S. government shutdown. The dollar weakens to a four-month low, while emerging-market currencies, including South Africa’s rand, rally amid a broader 'dollar debasement trade.' Meanwhile, U.S. stocks open higher, buoyed by strong fourth-quarter earnings, though concerns linger over sticky inflation and the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Corporate activity remains brisk, with notable deals including Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex and China’s Zijin Mining Group’s $4 billion purchase of Allied Gold. Elsewhere, Trinidad and Tobago and Ecuador tap debt markets, while a severe winter storm in the U.S. threatens up to $115 billion in economic damages. The Trump administration’s unpredictable trade policies and legal battles—including a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan—add to market jitters, as allies and businesses brace for further disruptions to the global economic order.
