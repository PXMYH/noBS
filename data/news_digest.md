## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as geopolitical and economic rifts deepen. In the U.S., Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, threaten a government shutdown over Republican funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations. Meanwhile, President Trump intensifies trade threats, vowing a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China, further straining North American relations. His aggressive stance extends to Venezuela, where he pledges to seize and process its oil despite lingering sanctions. At Davos, former Canadian Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland, now advising Ukraine, urges Putin to engage in negotiations, while Trump’s isolationist rhetoric at the forum cedes global economic leadership to China. Financial instability looms as Japan’s Prime Minister Takaichi warns of intervention amid yen volatility, and Venezuela’s economic crisis drives citizens toward cryptocurrency like USDT for stability.

## ⚽ Sports

The sports world sees major developments as the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, with the Washington Post abruptly scrapping its coverage plans just weeks before the Games begin in Italy, signaling potential logistical or editorial challenges. Meanwhile, in golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf league continues its controversial partnership with former President Donald Trump’s properties, announcing a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort—marking at least the sixth event hosted at Trump-owned venues since the league’s inception. The move underscores LIV Golf’s strategic alignment with high-profile, politically connected venues amid ongoing debates about the league’s global influence and ethics. Elsewhere, the sports media landscape faces uncertainty as major outlets adjust their Olympic preparations, while golf’s breakaway circuit solidifies its ties to polarizing figures, setting the stage for further scrutiny as the season progresses.
