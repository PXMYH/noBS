## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is making bold moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where President Trump is pushing for U.S. control over the country's oil reserves following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Major oil companies and commodities traders like Vitol and Trafigura are cautiously exploring opportunities in Venezuela, though many remain skeptical due to political and financial risks. Meanwhile, the fall of Maduro has eased tensions for neighboring Guyana, which stands to benefit from its own oil wealth without the threat of border conflicts. Elsewhere, China is closely monitoring U.S. actions in the region, where it has long held significant economic influence, while also flexing its diplomatic muscle by threatening to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s visit to Taiwan. Domestically, Trump is seeking expanded powers to pressure defense contractors and curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes, reflecting his broader economic agenda.
