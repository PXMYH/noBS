## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian infrastructure by striking oil drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea, aiming to cripple Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump is making aggressive moves in Latin America, pushing to lift sanctions on Venezuela and secure its oil reserves—a plan met with skepticism from major oil executives and concerns over political instability. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has eased regional tensions, particularly for oil-rich Guyana, but China’s deep economic ties in Latin America pose a strategic challenge to Trump’s ambitions. Domestically, Trump is pressuring defense contractors to accelerate weapons production and seeking congressional action to curb corporate housing investments, while Greenland firmly rejects his annexation proposals. Elsewhere, China’s diplomatic pressure on the UK over Taiwan underscores its assertive stance on sovereignty issues, and Ukrainian businesses, like vodka producer Nemiroff, continue to defy wartime disruptions by expanding exports.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as Asian equities prepare to follow U.S. gains, buoyed by softer-than-expected U.S. jobs data that reinforces the Federal Reserve’s patient stance on rate cuts. Bond traders’ bets on a dovish Fed appear vindicated, though concerns linger over corporate bonds teetering on junk status. In commodities, oil prices climb amid geopolitical tensions in Iran, while Iraq and Saudi Arabia cut crude prices for Asian buyers, signaling competitive pressures. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s bonds surge after Nicolás Maduro’s ouster, shrinking the pool of distressed emerging-market debt opportunities, though Exxon and other oil firms remain skeptical of Trump’s aggressive takeover of Venezuela’s oil industry, citing unresolved financial disputes. On the corporate front, merger talks between mining giants Rio Tinto and Glencore resurface, potentially creating the world’s largest mining company, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions. BlackRock forecasts continued strength in AI stocks but urges targeted investments, while JPMorgan Chase secures a deal to take over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking a shift in consumer finance strategies.
