## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate this week's headlines, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in the punishment of 69 high-ranking officials, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, with plans to suspend food sales taxes as part of her election strategy, reflecting domestic economic priorities amid political maneuvering. In the U.S., the Trump administration makes bold moves on multiple fronts: halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, while also asserting influence over Venezuela's oil sector—a controversial step that raises questions about corporate and geopolitical risks. The Pentagon's overhaul of the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, citing ideological concerns, further underscores the administration's efforts to tighten control over institutions.
