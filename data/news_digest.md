## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intensifies its involvement in Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers and detailing plans to control the country’s vast oil reserves following the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. The move, which has sparked debates in China about parallels to Taiwan and raised concerns over Venezuela’s debt to Beijing, signals a major shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, defense stocks surge as Trump pushes for a significant military budget increase, reflecting heightened global security concerns. In Ukraine, escalating Russian strikes on port infrastructure have slashed grain exports by 25%, exacerbating food security risks. Domestically, Trump’s push to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes highlights his economic agenda, while airlines cancel flights after the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace amid the Venezuela operation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reacting to a mix of geopolitical developments, central bank signals, and corporate shifts. The U.S. trade deficit has shrunk to its lowest level since 2009, driven by reduced imports, while the Federal Reserve hints at potential interest rate cuts of around 150 basis points in 2026 to support the labor market. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s oil reserves are at the center of market speculation, with U.S. refiners benefiting from President Trump’s plans to leverage the country’s crude to lower domestic oil prices. In corporate news, JPMorgan Chase is set to take over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking a strategic shift in the consumer finance sector. Emerging markets face pressure as geopolitical risks rise, while European bond markets see record demand amid a global debt binge. The housing market shows signs of balancing, and the energy sector gains on Venezuela-related bets, though skepticism remains about long-term investments in the region.
