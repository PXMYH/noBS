## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with President Trump's aggressive push into Venezuela's oil sector taking center stage. Despite ongoing protests in Iran and Venezuela, oil markets remain surprisingly stable, though U.S. frackers face mounting pressure from potential Venezuelan competition. Trump's $100 billion plan to revive Venezuela's oil industry has met skepticism from major oil executives, who cite political risks and uncertainty. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the U.S. makes its Latin American power play, having already established itself as the region's dominant economic partner. On the diplomatic front, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, while China's threat to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit underscores escalating tensions in Asia. Closer to home, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays, signaling a tougher stance on military readiness.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are rattled by escalating tensions between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve, with the Justice Department opening a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The probe, tied to his congressional testimony on Fed headquarters renovations, has reignited fears over central bank independence, triggering a broad sell-off in U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar while driving gold and silver to record highs. Investors are diversifying away from U.S. assets, reviving the 'sell America' trade, as political uncertainty overshadows economic fundamentals. Meanwhile, Europe and China take steps to resolve their electric vehicle dispute, allowing carmakers to volunteer import limits instead of facing tariffs—a potential boon for Volkswagen. In corporate news, BitGo Holdings aims to raise $201 million in a U.S. IPO, becoming the first crypto firm to pursue a listing in 2026, while Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and UBS lead debt financing for a Chinese acquisition of Italian luxury sneaker brand Golden Goose. General Motors reports a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions amid shifting federal policies, and Saks Global faces potential bankruptcy as it struggles to secure financing.
