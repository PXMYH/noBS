## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. is intensifying its intervention in Venezuela, seizing oil tankers and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration claims an agreement with Venezuela’s government, though negotiations remain ongoing, while the U.S. has also removed some sanctions to facilitate oil sales. The move has triggered global reactions, with China debating its implications for Taiwan and Mexico pledging to continue oil shipments to Cuba as humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks, and Canadian oil prices have tumbled amid the shifting energy landscape. Domestically, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has dissolved after losing federal funding, marking a significant shift in U.S. media policy.

Global markets are reacting to a mix of geopolitical shifts, economic data, and corporate developments this week. The U.S. is making bold moves in Venezuela, seizing control of its oil exports and marketing crude globally, which has sent energy stocks surging even as oil prices dip on supply concerns. Meanwhile, Treasury yields are falling as weak employment data fuels expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, though Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggests further cuts may be limited. Corporate activity is brisk, with Blackstone and other housing-related stocks tumbling after President Trump’s proposal to ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, while GameStop grants CEO Ryan Cohen performance-based options tied to a $100 billion valuation target. Overseas, Saudi Arabia opens its stock market to all foreign investors, and Europe sees a record €61 billion in bond sales, signaling strong appetite for debt amid favorable conditions. The week also marks notable closures, including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, reflecting ongoing pressures in media and public funding.
