## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has sent shockwaves through global markets and geopolitics, with Venezuelan oil now under U.S. control and tankers being intercepted in the Atlantic and Caribbean. The move has disrupted China’s long-standing oil deals with Venezuela, sparking debates in Beijing about its implications for Taiwan, while U.S. businesses remain cautious amid uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s aggressive stance on Venezuela has drawn mixed reactions from conservative media, some of whom now support intervention despite past opposition. Elsewhere, tensions between China and the UK flared after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting ongoing diplomatic friction. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff continue operations despite wartime challenges, while the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, causing flight cancellations amid the Venezuela crisis.
