## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration continues to reshape U.S. policy with bold and controversial moves. The Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over its editorial direction and alignment with Trump’s policies. Meanwhile, the State Department indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for nationals from 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. On the economic front, Trump’s push to exploit Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, which prefer domestic sources over the geopolitical risks of foreign ventures. Internationally, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa’s pivot toward deeper economic ties amid worsening U.S.-China tensions. In entertainment, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy steps down, marking a leadership shift in the *Star Wars* franchise.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are navigating a mix of political uncertainty and economic resilience as President Trump's disruptive policy agenda—including a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates and a potential ban on corporate single-family home purchases—rattles sectors from banking to real estate. The Federal Reserve remains a focal point, with Vice Chair Philip Jefferson affirming current monetary policy as 'well positioned,' though traders now anticipate no rate cuts before June amid lingering questions over Fed independence following a DOJ probe into Chair Jerome Powell. Meanwhile, corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs beat estimates, buoyed by wealth management and asset growth, while Bank of America, Citi, and JPMorgan fell short as Trump’s credit card threats loom. In commodities, European gas prices surged 30% on cold weather and short-covering, while gold dipped as Trump’s hesitation over Fed leadership picks unsettled investors. On the deal front, private equity firms CD&R and TPG are seeking $2.5 billion in financing for veterinary tech firm Covetrus, and Clear Street closed a $12 billion pre-IPO round, signaling robust appetite for private markets despite broader volatility.
