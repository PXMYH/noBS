## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate this week’s headlines, with Canada and the UK navigating delicate relations with China. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dispatches former Bank of England governor Mark Carney to Beijing in a bid to repair strained ties and secure new trade opportunities, signaling Ottawa’s push to diversify markets amid worsening U.S.-China relations. Meanwhile, the UK faces diplomatic fallout after China threatened to scuttle key trade talks following a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing’s growing assertiveness over territorial sensitivities. In a separate development, the U.S. draws criticism for its aggressive pursuit of Venezuelan oil resources, with analysts warning President Trump’s resource-focused strategy risks undermining long-term American economic influence. On the ground in Ukraine, resilience defines the private sector as businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff defy wartime disruptions, expanding exports to Western markets despite ongoing Russian strikes. The contrasting narratives—diplomatic brinkmanship, resource grabs, and wartime resilience—paint a picture of a fractured global order where economic and military pressures collide.
