## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. is asserting control over Venezuela’s oil sector following the capture of Nicolás Maduro by American special forces, with the Trump administration engaging in talks with oil companies to revive production. The seizure of a Russian-flagged tanker fleeing Venezuela underscores escalating tensions, while global oil markets fluctuate amid uncertainty over supply. Meanwhile, China debates the implications of Maduro’s ouster, with some viewing it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others warn of ideological risks. Domestically, the U.S. has dissolved the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after defunding it, and airlines cancel flights due to Caribbean airspace closures tied to the Venezuela operation. In Europe, Slovenia’s president nominates a central bank governor to break a political deadlock ahead of elections.
