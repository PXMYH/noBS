## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions and shifting monetary policies, with the Federal Reserve and other central banks holding interest rates steady amid economic uncertainty. The U.S. under Trump’s 'America First' policies is disrupting trade dynamics, sparking volatility in equities, bonds, and commodities—including a surge in silver prices and speculation around yen intervention by Japan. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, highlighted by Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a potential IPO. However, risks loom in private credit markets, where BlackRock’s 19% write-down on a debt fund underscores growing concerns. Investors are also recalibrating portfolios, favoring emerging markets and gold as diversification plays gain traction.

## 💻 Technology

This week’s headlines highlight a mix of economic shifts, regulatory tensions, and tech-driven disruptions. In the tech sector, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s upcoming visit to China underscores the company’s push to revive AI chip sales amid slowing demand, while TikTok’s corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about future app changes for its 200 million American users. Meanwhile, the IMF warns of an AI 'tsunami' threatening entry-level jobs, particularly for young workers, as automation reshapes labor markets. On the political front, President Trump’s erratic policy moves—from backing away from Greenland threats to signaling a Fed chair pick—keep global markets on edge, while his administration’s trade policies strain U.S.-Canada auto relations. Elsewhere, mining stocks surge as AI-driven demand for critical metals sparks a potential supercycle, and Netflix’s ad revenue doubles, signaling a strategic pivot paying off. Regulatory crackdowns also dominate, with the FCC targeting late-night TV political appearances and a lawsuit challenging AI recruitment tools over bias concerns.
