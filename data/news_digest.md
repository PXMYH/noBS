## 🌍 World & Politics

President Donald Trump is making aggressive moves to reshape Venezuela’s oil sector following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, pushing for a $100 billion investment plan to revive the country’s energy industry. However, major oil executives remain hesitant due to political instability and sanctions concerns, despite Trump’s assurances that Venezuela is 'open for business.' The situation is further complicated by China’s deep economic ties in Latin America, as Beijing watches Washington’s actions closely. Meanwhile, oil prices surge for a third consecutive week amid escalating protests in Iran and fears of supply disruptions, with hedge funds increasing bullish bets on crude. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leaders firmly reject Trump’s annexation claims, while China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring rising geopolitical tensions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with a risk-on rally, as U.S. stocks surged to fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, December’s stronger-than-expected jobs report dampened immediate hopes for a January rate cut, with traders now pricing in minimal chances of a move this month. The Fed’s cautious stance is reinforced by lingering inflation concerns, though the central bank’s independence faces pressure as the Trump administration seeks to reshape its policies. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains brisk: Rio Tinto and Glencore revived merger talks that could create the world’s largest mining giant, while IPOs like Aktis Oncology’s $318 million debut and upcoming listings from First Student and EquipmentShare signal a busy year for public offerings. In other developments, General Motors reported a $7.1 billion loss tied to its scaled-back EV ambitions, and Trump’s directive for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds sparked debate over housing affordability and market intervention.
