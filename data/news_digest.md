## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical tensions are driving significant economic and diplomatic shifts, with trade disputes and military concerns taking center stage. President Trump escalates protectionist measures, threatening a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a trade deal with China, while the UK moves to tighten steel import restrictions amid a global glut fueled by Chinese production. Meanwhile, Trump’s push for U.S. investment in Venezuela clashes with lingering sanctions, complicating business opportunities in the crisis-stricken nation. Domestic unrest in the U.S. sees mass protests in Minnesota against ICE operations, reflecting growing public resistance to immigration enforcement policies. Internationally, China-Japan relations sour as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo’s remarks on Taiwan, underscoring the fragile balance in East Asia. The surge in defense stocks highlights investor bets on prolonged global instability, while Venezuela’s economic turmoil drives locals toward cryptocurrencies like USDT as a hedge against volatility.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with uncertainty as gold surges past $5,000 an ounce, driven by investor flight from sovereign bonds and currencies amid geopolitical tensions. The Federal Reserve is expected to pause its rate-cutting cycle this week, citing a stabilizing jobs market, while the dollar weakens on speculation of potential U.S.-Japan currency intervention. Corporate earnings show signs of broadening beyond Big Tech, though consumer spending remains cautious, with retailers like Lowe's targeting younger demographics as homebuying stalls. Meanwhile, high-profile deals, including Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's potential IPO, highlight shifting investment trends, while Trump's trade policies and legal battles with JPMorgan add to market volatility.

## ⚽ Sports

The 2029 Asian Winter Games, originally scheduled to be held at Saudi Arabia's futuristic Neom desert ski resort, have been postponed following an agreement between Saudi officials and the Olympic Council of Asia. The decision marks a significant setback for the kingdom's ambitious sports and tourism plans, though no new dates have been announced. Meanwhile, the Washington Post has abruptly scrapped its coverage plans for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, just weeks before the event, signaling potential logistical or editorial challenges. In golf, the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump's properties, announcing another tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey—part of a growing partnership that has seen at least six events hosted at Trump venues over the past four years. The move underscores LIV Golf's strategy of leveraging high-profile venues amid its ongoing rivalry with traditional golf tours.
