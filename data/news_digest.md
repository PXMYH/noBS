## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate this week's headlines, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in the punishment of 69 high-ranking officials, underscoring President Xi Jinping's ongoing efforts to consolidate power and root out graft within the Communist Party. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, signaling potential economic shifts as she considers suspending food sales taxes—a move tied to her election campaign promises. In the U.S., the Trump administration tightens immigration policies by halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting controversial claims over Venezuela's oil reserves, though energy analysts remain skeptical about industry interest. On the security front, the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, advising pilots to avoid certain Pacific Ocean routes near Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, raising tensions in the region. Domestically, the Pentagon moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, criticizing its editorial direction as 'woke' and seeking greater Defense Department control, reflecting broader political polarization under Trump's leadership.
