## 🌍 World & Politics

{
    "summary": "The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious about investing in the politically unstable country, despite Trump’s $100 billion plan to revive its oil sector. The shift in Venezuela’s leadership also eases tensions for Guyana, which faces reduced border-conflict risks amid its own oil boom. Meanwhile, China watches closely as the US expands its influence in a region where Beijing has long held economic dominance, particularly as Mexico sends oil shipments to Cuba, further straining US relations.

Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor union leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, asserting the territory is 'not for sale,' while Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on with exports despite ongoing war disruptions, highlighting resilience amid conflict. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and urges Congress to block Wall Street from buying single-family homes, aiming to address housing market challenges.",
