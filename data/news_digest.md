Global markets are grappling with renewed trade tensions as President Donald Trump’s threat of a 10% tariff on European allies over Greenland sparks volatility. European stocks and U.S. futures fell sharply, while safe-haven assets like gold and silver surged to record highs.

In corporate news, Novo Nordisk shares jumped 8% on strong early sales of its obesity drug Wegovy, while Saks Global filed for bankruptcy after its risky acquisition of Neiman Marcus. The Federal Reserve’s independence is under scrutiny as Trump’s administration investigates Chair Jerome Powell, raising fears of inflation resurgence if central bank autonomy is compromised. Elsewhere, sovereign wealth funds are increasingly turning to private credit in emerging markets, and prediction markets are gaining traction, with Goldman Sachs exploring opportunities in the space.
