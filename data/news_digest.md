## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intervention in Venezuela sends shockwaves through markets and diplomacy. The ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro triggers debates in China over potential parallels with Taiwan, while Beijing imposes export controls on Japan in retaliation for remarks supporting the island. Venezuela’s oil sector, already in disrepair, faces uncertainty as China’s billions in loans hang in the balance, though emerging markets rally past the immediate risks. Meanwhile, the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace amid military operations, disrupting flights, while Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war. Domestic shifts also make waves, with the U.S. defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, and Warren Buffett’s departure from Berkshire Hathaway raising questions about the future of its massive equity portfolio.
