## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week, with the U.S. taking aggressive steps in Latin America and Iran. President Trump escalates pressure on Iran by imposing a 25% tariff on countries trading with Tehran, amid ongoing protests and economic instability in the region. Meanwhile, his push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector faces skepticism from major energy firms, despite high-profile meetings with executives. Analysts warn that Trump’s Venezuela strategy could undermine U.S. oil producers already struggling with low prices and oversupply. In Asia, Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi fuels speculation of a snap election as markets surge, while China asserts its influence in Latin America, closely monitoring U.S. moves in a region where it holds significant economic leverage. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite wartime challenges, and diplomatic tensions flare after China threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit.
