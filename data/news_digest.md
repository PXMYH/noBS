## 🌍 World & Politics

The United States has executed a bold military operation in Venezuela, capturing ousted President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a raid that marks a significant escalation in Washington’s intervention in the crisis-stricken nation. President Donald Trump has declared the U.S. will temporarily administer Venezuela until a stable transition can be arranged, while also pledging that American oil companies will invest billions to revive the country’s struggling petroleum sector. The move has triggered geopolitical ripples, with Saudi stocks plummeting amid broader regional tensions, though oil markets appear resilient, absorbing the shock without major supply disruptions. Meanwhile, diplomatic friction persists elsewhere, as China threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s visit to Taiwan, while also leveraging economic measures like a ban on Japanese scallops to signal displeasure with Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. The Maduro capture has also spurred financial speculation, with Venezuelan bond investors betting on gains amid hopes for regime change, even as the U.S. tightens control over Venezuelan airspace, disrupting flights in the Caribbean.
