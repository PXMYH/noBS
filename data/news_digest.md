## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies dominate headlines. His threat to impose tariffs over Greenland sparks a sharp response from European leaders, who convene an emergency summit and warn of retaliatory measures. The move weakens the dollar, boosting copper prices, while China's economic growth aligns with government targets. Meanwhile, Japan faces fiscal uncertainty as bonds slump amid speculation of a food tax cut ahead of an impending snap election. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about military activity near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, raising concerns over regional stability. On the domestic front, Kathleen Kennedy steps down as Lucasfilm president, marking a shift in leadership for the 'Star Wars' franchise. Additionally, Trump's push to assert control over Venezuela's oil reserves meets skepticism from major oil companies, who prefer domestic sources over geopolitical risks.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face fresh volatility as President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on European nations over Greenland sparks risk aversion, weakening the dollar and boosting gold and silver to record highs. The uncertainty weighs on stocks, with US and European futures falling, while haven assets rally. Meanwhile, China's economic woes deepen as real estate prices continue to decline, though exports helped the country meet its 5% GDP growth target for 2025. Corporate earnings in India disappoint, with Reliance and ICICI Bank missing expectations, adding pressure on the Nifty index. In the US, major banks report mixed results, with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs outperforming, while Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo fall short amid Trump's proposed credit card rate caps. Central banks, including Romania's, maintain tight monetary policies to combat persistent inflation, while gold demand surges as institutions seek hedges against geopolitical and economic instability.
