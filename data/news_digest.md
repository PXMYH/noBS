## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S.-led ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, sending shockwaves through financial markets and geopolitical alliances. Investors like Jim Craige and Michael Burry are positioning for Venezuela’s economic revival, while China faces uncertainty over billions in oil-backed loans to Caracas. The transition to acting President Delcy Rodríguez raises questions about Venezuela’s future stability and its impact on regional oil markets, with Canadian crude prices already weakening. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights amid heightened military activity. Beyond Venezuela, tensions flare between China and the West: Beijing threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and imposed a scallop ban on Japan, escalating diplomatic disputes. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on despite wartime disruptions, while global debates over AI in education and China’s rare earths dominance underscore broader economic and technological shifts.
