## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines, with the US and Europe facing growing rifts over trade and energy policies. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil warns Europe must confront widening divisions with the US, while Yara International threatens to abandon a US ammonia project if the EU excludes fertilizers from its carbon border levy. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector meets skepticism from US oil executives, who cite political risks and market instability. His broader Latin America strategy also draws scrutiny as China, already the region’s dominant economic partner, monitors US moves closely. In other developments, China’s antitrust probe into food-delivery giants like Meituan and Alibaba sparks market optimism, while Ukraine’s Nemiroff vodka maker defies wartime challenges to expand exports. The UK’s diplomatic tensions with China resurface after a minister’s Taiwan visit nearly derailed trade talks, underscoring Beijing’s assertive stance on sovereignty issues.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are on edge as the Trump administration escalates its pressure on the Federal Reserve, with the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The move, widely condemned by former Fed officials and economists, has reignited fears over central bank independence, triggering a 'sell America' trade that weakens U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar while boosting gold and emerging-market assets. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal mixed signals: General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back EV ambitions, while Tata Consultancy Services misses profit estimates amid sluggish tech spending. In dealmaking, Paramount Skydance is fighting Warner Bros Discovery’s $82.7 billion Netflix deal, and BitGo is pushing ahead with a $201 million IPO, marking the first crypto listing of 2026. Commodities face disruptions, with Kazakh oil shipments slashed due to port issues and Iranian inventories declining amid unrest, while traders Vitol and Trafigura prepare to move Venezuelan oil to Caribbean storage.
