## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Asia, Malaysia weighs the future of its controversial trade deal with the U.S., signaling cautious engagement amid domestic concerns, while China-Japan relations sour as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo’s remarks on Taiwan’s security. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces internal and external trade challenges: President Trump threatens a new trade war even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority, and his administration explores investment in Venezuela despite lingering sanctions that complicate business opportunities. Financial and diplomatic pressures also surface in Europe, where the UK fines Bank of Scotland for facilitating transactions for a sanctioned Putin ally, underscoring ongoing enforcement of Western sanctions against Russia. Domestically, mass protests in Minnesota highlight growing opposition to ICE operations, with organizers demanding the agency’s withdrawal from the state.

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank caution, and shifting investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve signals a pause in rate cuts despite political pressure from President Trump, while the ECB emphasizes maintaining 'full optionality' amid economic uncertainty.

Meanwhile, corporate America faces headwinds: GM reports a $7.1 billion EV-related write-down, and FAT Brands files for bankruptcy, underscoring challenges in consumer sectors. Trade dynamics remain fluid, with China pivoting to Brazilian soybeans after meeting U.S. commitments, and Trump threatening new tariffs on South Korea.
