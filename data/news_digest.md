## 🌍 World & Politics

Global financial and political tensions dominate headlines as Japan faces economic instability ahead of a snap election, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warning of intervention amid a weakening yen and surging bond yields. In the U.S., Democrats threaten a government shutdown over funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while President Trump escalates trade threats, vowing a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China. Meanwhile, China gains ground as Trump renounces U.S. leadership in the global economy, further straining relations. The UK also tightens trade policies, reducing tariff-free steel imports to counter a global glut driven by Chinese production. Protests erupt in Minnesota over ICE operations, reflecting growing domestic unrest, while Venezuela's economic crisis pushes locals toward cryptocurrency as a hedge against instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant volatility as geopolitical tensions and economic policy shifts reshape investor sentiment. Gold surges past $5,000 an ounce, driven by safe-haven demand amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s disruptive trade policies and currency interventions. The dollar weakens as Japan signals potential yen-buying intervention, while the Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady despite political pressure from Trump, who continues to push for lower rates. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains robust, with Capital One’s $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX’s preparations for a blockbuster IPO. However, risks loom in private credit markets and China’s stock market, where the withdrawal of state-backed support raises concerns. Small businesses show resilience, but trade uncertainties and inflation pressures persist, keeping policymakers and investors on edge.
