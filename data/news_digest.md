## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates this week's geopolitical headlines with a series of controversial moves. The Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over its editorial direction and alignment with Trump's policies—a decision critics label as politically motivated. Meanwhile, the administration indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, a policy that risks further straining international relations. Trump also escalates his focus on Venezuela, declaring himself its 'acting president' and pushing to seize its oil reserves, though analysts warn the move could backfire economically and alienate global oil markets. Elsewhere, Canada seeks to diversify its trade partnerships as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, signaling a shift away from U.S. dependence amid growing tensions. The combined actions underscore a fractious global landscape, with Trump's aggressive policies drawing both domestic and international scrutiny.
