## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s aggressive trade policies and diplomatic retreats reshaping international dynamics. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump’s keynote speech signals a further withdrawal from the liberal democratic order, ceding economic leadership to China, while his threats of a new trade war raise concerns about long-term U.S. economic stability. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s progress in trilateral peace talks with the U.S. and Russia eases oil market tensions, offering a glimmer of hope amid ongoing conflict. Domestically, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though Trump’s tariff threats and potential legal challenges loom over economic policy. In Venezuela, citizens turn to cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against political and economic instability, highlighting the broader impact of unstable governance on global financial behavior.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded sharply on Thursday after President Donald Trump reversed his threat to impose tariffs on eight European countries, easing geopolitical tensions that had triggered a sell-off earlier in the week. The relief rally, dubbed the 'Trump Always Chickens Out' (TACO) trade, lifted U.S. and European stocks, with AI-related names and small-cap stocks leading gains. Gold also hit a record high as the dollar weakened amid mixed economic signals, including sticky inflation data showing a 2.8% rise in consumer prices through November 2025. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders overwhelmingly rejected Paramount’s takeover bid, while Spirit Airlines entered deal talks with investment firm Castlelake amid its bankruptcy. In financial news, JPMorgan Chase faced a $5 billion lawsuit from Trump over alleged 'debanking,' and crypto firm BitGo surged 25% in its IPO debut. The Federal Reserve’s independence came under scrutiny as the Supreme Court weighed Trump’s attempt to fire a Fed governor, while traders speculated on a potential new Fed chair nomination, with BlackRock’s Rick Rieder emerging as a contender.
