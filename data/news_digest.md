## 💻 Technology

Global markets are riding high on AI enthusiasm, with semiconductor stocks surging after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's optimistic remarks at Davos. South Korea's Kospi index crossed the 5,000 milestone, while Disco Corp. shares jumped 15% on booming AI chip demand. Meanwhile, Netflix's ad strategy shift is paying off, with $1.5 billion in ad revenue last year and expectations to double that in 2026. The tech sector also faces regulatory scrutiny, as the FCC targets late-night TV shows for political candidate appearances, and a lawsuit challenges AI recruitment tools over bias concerns. Beyond tech, geopolitical tensions ease slightly as Trump walks back tariff threats against European nations, citing progress on a Greenland deal, though Denmark dismisses it as unreal. The Supreme Court appears skeptical of Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, signaling potential limits on presidential authority over the central bank.
