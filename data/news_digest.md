## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The move has triggered widespread repercussions, including market volatility, with European defense stocks and precious metals rising amid heightened geopolitical risks. China, a long-time ally of Venezuela, faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Caracas, while its oil buyers shun Venezuelan crude due to U.S. sanctions. The event has also sparked domestic debate in China, with some viewing it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others caution against ideological rigidity. Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to reshape U.S. institutions, defunding public broadcasting and downsizing the federal workforce, though critics argue efficiency has suffered. Elsewhere, tensions persist between China and Japan over Taiwan, with Beijing imposing trade restrictions on Japanese scallops as retaliation. Ukrainian businesses, including a major vodka exporter, demonstrate resilience by expanding exports despite ongoing conflict.
