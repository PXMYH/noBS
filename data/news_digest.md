## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In East Asia, South Korea’s stock exchange plans to extend trading hours as its benchmark index surges toward President Lee Jae Myung’s ambitious 5,000-point target, reflecting regional economic optimism. Meanwhile, Japan’s markets hit record highs amid speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call a snap election, signaling potential political volatility. In Latin America, President Trump’s aggressive push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector faces skepticism from U.S. energy executives, who remain wary of the country’s political risks. The move, part of a broader strategy to counter China’s deepening influence in the region, could exacerbate a global oil supply glut, further pressuring U.S. frackers already grappling with four-year-low prices. Elsewhere, China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring the fragile state of international relations. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff continue to expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, highlighting resilience amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank scrutiny, and shifting investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve faces unprecedented pressure as the U.S. Justice Department launches a criminal investigation into Chair Jerome Powell, sparking bipartisan backlash and concerns over the central bank's independence. Former Fed officials and economists, including Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu, warn that undermining the Fed's autonomy could destabilize markets and risk inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, Asian markets rally on cheaper valuations, with Chinese stocks gaining momentum amid surging margin loans and record turnover, though concerns persist about China's economic reliance on trade and tech sectors. In commodities, gold steadies after a surge driven by Fed uncertainty, while oil prices edge higher following Trump's threat of tariffs on Iranian crude buyers. Corporate developments include UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti's planned 2027 departure and criticism of Swiss banking reforms, alongside Hyundai Motor's $24 billion market value gain fueled by robotics enthusiasm. JPMorgan's upcoming earnings report is also in focus as investors seek insights into consumer and corporate health.
