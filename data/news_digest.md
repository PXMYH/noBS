## 🌍 World & Politics

Global markets are adapting to geopolitical shocks, with investors focusing on AI growth and potential rate cuts despite President Trump's unorthodox military operations, including the recent ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. is tightening control over Venezuela's oil industry, securing up to $2.8 billion worth of crude, while China faces uncertainty over its oil deals with Caracas. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Japan escalate as Beijing threatens to cut off rare earth supplies, a critical vulnerability for Japanese manufacturers. In other developments, the U.S. has closed airspace over the Caribbean due to military operations, disrupting flights, and China has warned the UK over diplomatic ties following a minister's visit to Taiwan. Domestically, the U.S. has defunded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, while businesses in Ukraine continue to operate amid ongoing conflict.

Global markets are showing mixed signals as 2026 begins, with Asia-Pacific equities facing headwinds from geopolitical tensions, including a China-Japan trade dispute and new export curbs on rare earths, which have boosted related stocks. Meanwhile, China's equity rally gains momentum, supported by strong trading volumes and optimistic forecasts from Goldman Sachs, which predicts a 20% gain for Chinese stocks this year.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by significant shifts in AI, automotive, and global markets. Baidu’s AI chip unit, Kunlunxin, is preparing for a $2 billion Hong Kong IPO, signaling strong investor confidence in AI hardware amid a broader memory shortage diverting resources to AI data centers—a trend IDC warns could depress the PC market in 2026. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s partnership with Chinese lidar maker Hesai underscores the accelerating race in autonomous driving technology, as global OEMs seek integrated hardware-software solutions. In the EV sector, China’s BYD dethrones Tesla as the world’s top electric car seller, capitalizing on Tesla’s slumping deliveries after U.S. subsidy cuts, while Lucid reports a 55% surge in 2025 deliveries, buoyed by its new Gravity SUV. Beyond tech, geopolitical tensions—particularly around Venezuela’s oil industry and U.S.-China relations—are disrupting markets, with Chevron positioned to benefit from potential Venezuelan oil expansion and China guarding its economic interests. The AI-driven productivity boom is also reshaping labor, with companies adopting four-day workweeks as automation takes over tasks, and Vista Equity Partners doubling down on 'agentic AI' to reinvent enterprise software.
