{
    "summary": "The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which has sent shockwaves through global markets and diplomatic circles. The operation, executed over the weekend, has drawn sharp condemnation from China, which called the move 'deeply shocking' and warned it could set a precedent for handling tensions with Taiwan. Analysts are now assessing the long-term impact on Venezuela’s oil industry, the world’s largest by proven reserves, as investors bet on a potential regime change that could reshape the country’s economic future. Meanwhile, Saudi stocks have plummeted amid rising geopolitical tensions in Yemen, Iran, and Venezuela, reflecting broader market unease.

In other developments, India’s aviation sector faces turmoil as its two dominant carriers struggle, prompting government intervention. Ukraine’s resilience is highlighted by businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff, which continues to expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks. Additionally, China’s economic leverage is under scrutiny, from its decades-long dominance in rare earth minerals to trade threats over Taiwan-related diplomatic spats, including a ban on Japanese scallops as retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on the island.",
