## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration is intensifying its focus on Venezuela, with plans to control the country’s oil sales after the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has seized two tankers, including a Russian-flagged vessel, as part of a broader blockade, while Citgo considers resuming Venezuelan oil purchases. The move has sparked geopolitical tensions, with China debating the implications for its own interests, including Taiwan, and Beijing’s oil deals with Caracas now in question. Domestically, Trump is pushing Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchases of single-family homes and cracking down on defense contractors over executive pay, even as he seeks a $1.5 trillion military budget. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, and public broadcasting faces dissolution after federal funding cuts. The fallout from Maduro’s capture continues to reshape global energy markets and diplomatic relations.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, policy shifts, and corporate maneuvering in early 2026. President Trump's aggressive stance on Venezuela—including plans to indefinitely control its oil sales and seize tankers—has rattled energy markets, lifting oil prices and boosting the S&P 500's energy sector, though experts remain skeptical about U.S. firms' willingness to invest heavily in the region. Meanwhile, Asian markets show cautious optimism, with Philippine bonds emerging as a standout due to attractive yields and anticipated rate cuts, while China's metals markets experience a speculative frenzy driven by copper, nickel, and lithium trading. On the corporate front, JPMorgan Chase's takeover of the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs marks a significant shift in consumer finance, while Blackstone and housing stocks face pressure after Trump's proposal to ban institutional investors from single-family homes. The Fed's independence is under scrutiny as political pressures mount, with Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari suggesting limited room for further rate cuts. Elsewhere, high-profile struggles include the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's shutdown after decades of losses, Saks Global's leadership shakeup amid debt woes, and the looming SpaceX IPO, which could become the largest in history.
