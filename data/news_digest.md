The sports world sees major developments as the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, with the Washington Post abruptly scrapping its coverage plans just weeks before the Games begin in Italy. Meanwhile, LIV Golf continues to strengthen its ties with the Trump Organization, announcing another tournament at a Trump-owned resort in New Jersey—marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in four years. The move underscores the growing influence of Saudi-backed LIV Golf in the sport, despite ongoing controversies. Elsewhere, the sudden shift in Olympic coverage raises questions about media preparations for the high-profile event, as organizers and broadcasters finalize logistics.
