## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a risk-on rally, as U.S. stocks hit fresh highs amid optimism over economic growth and expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. The December jobs report, showing slowing payroll growth, reinforced the Fed’s cautious stance, though officials signal they need clearer signs of rising unemployment before easing further. Meanwhile, corporate earnings revealed mixed fortunes: General Motors posted a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its EV ambitions, while IMAX thrived as a standout in the theater industry. Mergers and acquisitions also took center stage, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting talks for a potential $260 billion mining mega-deal, and JPMorgan Chase acquiring the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. In policy moves, President Trump directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to boost housing affordability, while his administration’s push to tap Venezuela’s oil reserves faced skepticism from energy executives wary of political risks. India’s economy grew at 7.4%, though analysts warned of underlying weaknesses, while Switzerland’s flexible labor market continued to draw attention as a model for resilience.
