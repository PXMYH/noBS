## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded Wednesday after President Donald Trump signaled progress on a 'framework' deal with NATO regarding Greenland, easing fears of new European tariffs that had triggered a sharp selloff earlier in the week. The S&P 500 stabilized, Treasuries rose on strong demand, and energy stocks hit record highs amid geopolitical uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court appeared poised to reject Trump’s attempt to immediately fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, underscoring concerns about central bank independence. In corporate news, Netflix shares tumbled after a disappointing earnings forecast tied to increased programming spending and its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Elsewhere, JPMorgan Chase became the world’s largest active ETF issuer, while Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong early sales of its obesity drug Wegovy. Economic indicators remained mixed, with Malaysia holding rates steady amid strong growth and low inflation, while China’s real estate crash continued to weigh on its economy despite robust export-driven growth.
