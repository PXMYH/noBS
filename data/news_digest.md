## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical and economic tensions dominate global headlines as President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies and territorial claims strain transatlantic relations. A Commerzbank analyst warns that escalating US-EU disputes over Greenland could trigger sanctions affecting European holders of US Treasuries, while Trump's tariff threats persist despite potential legal challenges. Meanwhile, Reliance Industries resumes purchases of non-sanctioned Russian crude, signaling India's balancing act amid Western sanctions. In Latin America, Chile's President-elect José Antonio Kast reshuffles his cabinet, merging mining and economy ministries, while Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward USDT stablecoins as a hedge against inflation. On the diplomatic front, ECB President Christine Lagarde's abrupt exit from a Davos dinner underscores rising US-EU frictions, while Ukraine's first post-invasion bond sale by MHP SE marks a cautious step toward economic recovery. Domestically, the US Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though economic protests in Minnesota highlight growing unrest over immigration enforcement.
