## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. is making bold geopolitical moves, most notably with the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by special forces, a dramatic escalation that has sparked global reactions. The operation, which includes attempts to seize a Russia-flagged ship linked to Venezuela, signals a shift in U.S. foreign policy under Trump, who now frames the intervention as a strategic play for Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. While some conservative media outlets praise the action, others question its consistency with Trump’s past anti-interventionist rhetoric. The ouster of Maduro also strains Venezuela’s ties with China, leaving billions in Beijing’s loans to Caracas in limbo and igniting debates in China over parallels to Taiwan. Meanwhile, the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, and oil companies engage in talks with the White House to revive Venezuela’s struggling energy sector. Elsewhere, tensions persist between China and the UK over Taiwan, with Beijing threatening to cancel trade talks after a British minister’s visit, while Japan faces economic retaliation from China over its Taiwan stance. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, and schools grapple with the rise of AI tools amid skepticism from educators.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by high-stakes corporate battles, AI-driven workplace shifts, and geopolitical tensions. Warner Bros. Discovery's board continues to reject Paramount's $108 billion hostile takeover bid, favoring its existing deal with Netflix, signaling a major power struggle in the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, AI adoption accelerates as companies like Vista Equity Partners push 'agentic software' to reinvent business operations, while others experiment with four-day workweeks powered by automation. Geopolitical moves also dominate, with the U.S. eyeing Greenland's mineral wealth and China warning of rare earth export restrictions, raising concerns in Japan and beyond. In energy, Venezuela's oil industry becomes a flashpoint as U.S. intervention disrupts travel and sparks speculation about Chevron's potential expansion, while BYD overtakes Tesla as the world's top EV seller amid shifting subsidies. Financial markets remain volatile, with Citadel's hedge fund posting strong gains and Jamie Dimon's record pay reflecting a deregulatory boom for banks.
