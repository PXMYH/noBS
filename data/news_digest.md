## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, French President Emmanuel Macron’s unusual appearance—wearing sunglasses to conceal a burst blood vessel—overshadowed discussions on escalating crises, while President Trump’s keynote speech signaled a retreat from the liberal democratic order, further ceding global economic leadership to China. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s announcement of upcoming trilateral peace talks with the U.S. and Russia sparks cautious optimism, driving a dip in oil prices amid hopes for de-escalation. Domestically, the U.S. Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though Trump’s aggressive trade policies and threats of a new tariff war loom large as courts weigh limiting his executive authority. Elsewhere, economic instability fuels protests in Minnesota over immigration enforcement, while Venezuela’s turn to cryptocurrency like USDT highlights growing distrust in faltering governments.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded sharply on Thursday after President Trump walked back threats of tariffs on European countries and Greenland, easing geopolitical tensions that had triggered a sell-off earlier in the week. The relief rally lifted stocks worldwide, with European autos, luxury goods, and tech sectors leading gains, while the dollar weakened as risk sentiment improved. Meanwhile, economic data showed resilience in U.S. consumer spending and sticky inflation, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve will delay interest-rate cuts until later in 2026. The Supreme Court also signaled skepticism toward Trump’s attempt to fire a Fed governor, underscoring concerns about central bank independence. In corporate news, SpaceX advanced plans for a landmark IPO, while Procter & Gamble posted mixed earnings, and Spirit Airlines entered takeover talks with investment firm Castlelake. Elsewhere, Nestlé initiated the sale of its water business, and GM announced it would shift production of a Buick SUV from China to the U.S., reflecting ongoing trade and supply chain adjustments.

## ⚽ Sports

Venezuela is poised to debate a significant oil sector reform bill that could reshape its energy industry. The proposed legislation, set for discussion on Thursday, would permit private oil companies to market their own production, reduce tax burdens, and resolve disputes through international arbitration rather than Venezuelan courts. This move signals a potential shift toward greater private sector involvement in Venezuela's state-dominated oil industry, which has long been plagued by inefficiencies and declining production. If passed, the bill could attract foreign investment and modernize the sector, though critics may raise concerns about sovereignty and regulatory oversight. The debate comes as Venezuela seeks to revive its struggling economy amid ongoing geopolitical and economic challenges.
