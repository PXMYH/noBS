## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warns of increased Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic, raising concerns over regional security. Meanwhile, President Trump's aggressive trade policies and economic strategies face legal challenges, with courts weighing whether to curb his tariff authority, even as economists caution his approach could weaken the U.S. economy long-term. Domestically, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, while Minnesota braces for an economic blackout protest against federal immigration enforcement. In Latin America, the FAA issues warnings about military activity near key ocean routes, and Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against volatility. Oil markets remain cautious amid Trump's push to exploit Venezuelan reserves, with U.S. firms favoring domestic production over risky foreign ventures.
