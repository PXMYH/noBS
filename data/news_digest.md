## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, where airstrikes led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, with American oil companies set to rebuild the country’s oil infrastructure. The move has prompted Venezuela’s Supreme Court to grant temporary presidential powers to Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, while global oil markets remain largely unaffected despite Venezuela’s vast reserves. Meanwhile, tensions in East Asia escalate as North Korea launches ballistic missiles ahead of a summit between South Korean and Chinese leaders, underscoring regional instability. In diplomatic news, China previously threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting Beijing’s sensitivity to Taiwan-related issues. Additionally, Japan faces economic pressure from China’s ban on Japanese scallops, a retaliatory measure tied to Taiwan tensions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism, as the S&P 500 inched higher amid mixed signals. Semiconductor stocks led gains, buoyed by anticipation for the CES tech conference, while concerns over stretched valuations and inflation lingered. The Federal Reserve faces a divided path forward, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson hinting at potential rate cuts later in the year, though minutes from December’s meeting revealed deep splits among officials over whether inflation or unemployment poses a greater risk. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk: Saks Global’s CEO stepped down as the luxury retailer teeters toward bankruptcy, while SpaceX’s impending IPO looms as a potential blockbuster event. Commodities saw volatility, with silver retreating sharply after a record high and oil fluctuating amid supply surplus fears. Geopolitical and economic uncertainties, including Trump’s tariff policies and China’s new silver export restrictions, added to the complex backdrop as investors weigh whether 2025’s market rally can sustain its momentum.

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by shifting dynamics in AI, electric vehicles, and global trade.

Meanwhile, AI continues to drive market optimism, with emerging-market stocks hitting a five-year high on bets tied to Asia's growing role in the technology. Regulatory pressures are also intensifying, as China cracks down on AI chatbots and Europe considers rolling back its 2035 combustion engine ban. In corporate news, Uber restructures contracts to avoid UK taxes, while Citadel's flagship fund posts a 10.2% gain in a volatile 2025.
