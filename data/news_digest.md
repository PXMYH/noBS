## 🌍 World & Politics

Global energy markets and geopolitical tensions dominate this week’s headlines, with Russia’s oil and gas revenues plummeting to a five-year low in 2025, dealing a significant blow to its war chest for the Ukraine conflict. The decline, driven by slumping crude prices and reduced gas exports, underscores the economic strain on Moscow amid prolonged sanctions. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive posture toward Venezuela—including self-declared authority over its oil reserves—faces skepticism from major oil firms, who view domestic production as a more stable alternative. Trump’s stance on Iran also shifts, with oil prices tumbling after he signals a pause in potential military action following Tehran’s pledge to spare protesters, easing immediate fears of escalation. On the diplomatic front, Canada’s former central bank governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair strained relations and explore new trade opportunities, a move that reflects Ottawa’s urgency to diversify markets as U.S. economic policies grow increasingly unpredictable. Closer to home, the Trump administration expands its immigration crackdown, indefinitely suspending visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns in a sweeping restriction on legal migration pathways.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Wall Street banks are navigating a mixed earnings season, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley outperforming expectations thanks to strong equities and wealth management divisions, while Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo face pressure from President Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. The banking sector is also bracing for potential regulatory shifts, as the Fed warns that undermining central bank independence could reignite inflation. Meanwhile, corporate struggles are evident in Saks Global’s bankruptcy filing, driven by debt from its Neiman Marcus acquisition, and Amazon’s $475 million stake in the deal turning worthless. In commodities, silver prices retreat after Trump delays tariffs on critical minerals, while China reports a record $1.19 trillion trade surplus, fueling global trade tensions. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs explores prediction markets, and European defense firms prepare for a wave of IPOs amid sustained demand.

## 💻 Technology

Tech and AI dominate headlines as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s strong earnings reignite optimism in artificial intelligence, pushing U.S. stocks near record highs. Meanwhile, President Trump imposes a 25% tariff on select AI chips, including Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI325X, citing national security concerns, though exemptions for data centers and consumers soften the impact. The U.S. also nears a trade deal with Taiwan, potentially boosting TSMC's U.S. manufacturing presence. Beyond tech, Boeing outperforms Airbus in 2025 deliveries, while JPMorgan faces pressure amid declining profits. Regulatory shifts loom as lawmakers revive crypto legislation, and the U.S. considers expanding private sector roles in cyberwarfare. Economic signals remain mixed, with modest U.S. hiring growth and a sluggish manufacturing sector under Trump's tariff policies.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers.
