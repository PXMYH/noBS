## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intensifies its focus on Venezuela following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, with President Trump pushing to revive the country’s oil sector amid skepticism from major energy firms. The move has drawn scrutiny from China, which holds significant economic influence in Latin America and is closely monitoring U.S. actions. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s financial strain deepens as Ukrainian Railways suspends bond payments due to the prolonged war with Russia, while businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff strive to maintain exports despite ongoing conflict. In other developments, China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface over Taiwan, and Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, underscoring broader Arctic sovereignty concerns.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with a mix of optimism and caution as investors weighed economic data, corporate earnings, and geopolitical risks. U.S. stocks surged to fresh record highs, buoyed by a strong jobs report that reinforced the Federal Reserve’s patient stance on interest rates, with traders now pricing in almost no chance of a January rate cut. Household wealth hit a new peak amid the equity rally, though concerns linger over tariff uncertainty and its impact on sectors like American whiskey exports. Meanwhile, corporate America saw major moves, including General Motors’ $7.1 billion earnings hit from scaling back EV ambitions and JPMorgan Chase’s takeover of the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. M&A activity heated up, with Rio Tinto and Glencore restarting merger talks to create the world’s largest mining giant, while Venezuela’s $60 billion bond restructuring talks and Trump’s plans to leverage its oil reserves added to energy market volatility. The ECB’s vice presidency race and China’s push to expand its duty-free Hainan island also underscored shifting economic priorities globally.
