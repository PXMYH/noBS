Global markets are reeling as geopolitical tensions escalate, with President Trump's threats of new tariffs over Greenland sparking a broad selloff. The S&P 500 wiped out its 2026 gains, dropping over 1% in early trading, while Treasuries and the dollar also fell amid heightened volatility. The standoff has strained U.S.-Europe relations, with EU leaders condemning the tariffs and calling Trump’s trustworthiness into question. Meanwhile, gold prices surged to record highs as investors seek safe-haven assets, reflecting deepening concerns over economic stability and capital flight risks. In corporate news, Netflix’s all-cash $82.7 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery intensifies, with the streaming giant securing $42 billion in bridge financing to outmaneuver rivals. The deal underscores a broader trend of consolidation in the media sector, even as market turbulence complicates financing conditions. Central banks, including Japan’s, are grappling with bond market instability, while the Fed faces uncertainty as Trump nears a decision on a new chair amid legal scrutiny of Jerome Powell. Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk shares jumped 8% on strong demand for its obesity drug Wegovy, and China’s economy showed resilience with 5% growth despite a real estate crash.
