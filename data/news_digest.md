## 🌍 World & Politics

The removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces dominates global headlines, triggering a 124% rally in Venezuela’s stock market and sparking debates over the country’s vast oil reserves. The Trump administration claims an agreement to secure up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, though negotiations remain ongoing, while commodities trader Vitol explores U.S. refiner interest in the resource. The geopolitical fallout extends to China, which faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Caracas and debates the implications for Taiwan. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens its grip on Venezuelan oil shipments, seizing two tankers, and closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights. Domestically, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, while Trump pushes Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases. In Ukraine, businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff press on despite wartime challenges, underscoring resilience amid ongoing conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signals that interest rates remain 'substantially above neutral' and hints at a potential Fed Chair replacement by President Trump in January. Investors are bracing for Friday’s U.S. jobs report, which could influence monetary policy, while Treasuries slip amid anticipation of a Supreme Court ruling on tariffs that have narrowed the trade deficit to its lowest since 2009. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector—aiming to drive crude prices to $50 a barrel—has sparked volatility in energy stocks, with the S&P 500’s energy sector surging 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuelan oil. Corporate shifts are also in focus, as JPMorgan takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, and Czech defense firm CSG prepares for an Amsterdam IPO. Elsewhere, Brazil’s equity funds hope for a rebound after record outflows, while Canada’s trade deficit masks weakness beyond gold exports.
