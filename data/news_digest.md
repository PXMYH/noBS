## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with Ukraine escalating its campaign against Russian energy infrastructure by striking oil drilling platforms in the Caspian Sea, aiming to cripple Moscow’s war funding. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making aggressive moves in Latin America, as President Trump pushes to lift sanctions on Venezuela and secure its oil reserves, though major oil executives remain hesitant amid political and logistical risks. The ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has also eased border tensions with Guyana, a rising oil power, while China watches Washington’s regional power play warily, given its own deep economic ties in Latin America. Elsewhere, Greenland’s leadership firmly rejects Trump’s annexation proposals, and China’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface over a minister’s Taiwan visit, threatening trade talks. Domestic U.S. politics see Trump pressing Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases and targeting defense contractors over delayed weapons deliveries, while Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into a controversial Middle East envoy.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets in early 2026 are navigating a mix of cautious optimism and lingering uncertainties. Bond traders are betting on a prolonged Federal Reserve easing cycle after softer U.S. job growth, while inflation shows signs of stabilizing, though the Fed remains hesitant to cut rates aggressively without clearer labor market weakness. Corporate bonds face pressure as more issuers teeter near junk status, and BlackRock predicts a bullish but selective year for AI stocks, urging investors to focus on income-generating assets. Meanwhile, geopolitical and commodity shifts are reshaping trade dynamics: Venezuela’s bonds surge amid political upheaval, though oil firms remain skeptical of investment opportunities, while Iraq and Saudi Arabia slash crude prices for Asian buyers. In M&A, Rio Tinto and Glencore revive merger talks, potentially creating a mining behemoth, while Trump’s policies—from mortgage bond purchases to credit card rate caps—spark debate over market interventions. Consumer trends highlight a bifurcated economy, with affluent buyers driving new car sales and Gen Z investors shifting from meme stocks to index funds, even as small businesses face modestly higher bankruptcy rates.

Meanwhile, Asia’s tech stocks surge as investors bet on the region’s AI leadership, though Chinese AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. In corporate news, Boeing reports its highest airplane deliveries in seven years, signaling a production ramp-up, while GM and Ford grapple with EV market slowdowns, with GM recording a $7.1 billion charge due to restructuring. Regulatory developments include U.S. lawmakers preparing a new push for comprehensive crypto legislation, and China investigating Meta’s acquisition of AI startup Manus over compliance concerns.
