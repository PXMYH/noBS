## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warns of potential intervention to stabilize the yen, signaling rare coordination with the U.S. amid currency volatility. Meanwhile, U.S. domestic politics heat up as Senate Democrats threaten a government shutdown over funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while mass protests in Minnesota demand an end to ICE operations. On the trade front, President Trump intensifies protectionist measures, threatening a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China, while the UK moves to restrict tariff-free steel imports amid a global glut. China's diplomatic influence grows as it benefits from Trump's retreat from global economic leadership, further strained by a tourism boycott of Japan over Taiwan tensions. Venezuela remains a flashpoint, with Trump eyeing its oil reserves despite sanctions, while locals increasingly turn to cryptocurrency to hedge against economic instability.
