Geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as Europe grapples with escalating hostilities with Russia. European Central Bank official Martins Kazaks warns that Europe is already 'at war' with Russia, urging central banks to prepare for further escalation. Meanwhile, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. In Latin America, the FAA issues advisories cautioning pilots about military activity over parts of the Pacific Ocean near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling heightened regional tensions. On the domestic front, former President Donald Trump makes financial moves, purchasing $1 million in Netflix and Warner Bros. bonds following their merger announcement, while his administration's controversial stance on Venezuela's oil raises questions about feasibility and corporate interest.
