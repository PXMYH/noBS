## 🌍 World & Politics

President Donald Trump is making bold moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where he is pushing for U.S. control over the country’s oil reserves following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Trump met with oil executives to encourage investment in Venezuela, though many remain hesitant due to political and financial risks. The U.S. claims Venezuela will relinquish up to 50 million barrels of oil, but negotiations with the state-owned oil company are still ongoing. Meanwhile, Guyana stands to benefit from Maduro’s fall, as tensions over its oil-rich border region ease. Elsewhere, China is closely monitoring U.S. actions in Latin America, where it has long held significant economic influence. In other developments, Greenland’s labor union leader rejected Trump’s annexation claims, while Democratic lawmakers called for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Additionally, a Mexican oil shipment to Cuba has heightened U.S. tensions, and Ukraine’s Nemiroff vodka maker continues exports despite wartime challenges.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets in early 2026 are shaped by geopolitical shifts, central bank caution, and sector-specific trends. The U.S. stock market, while still buoyed by AI optimism, is underperforming relative to international peers as investors diversify away from the dollar. Defense stocks are surging amid global instability, while gold remains a favored safe haven after its record 2025 rally. Meanwhile, President Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil sector—aiming to slash U.S. oil prices to $50 a barrel—faces skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which cite unresolved debt and investment risks. On the corporate front, a potential $260 billion merger between mining titans Rio Tinto and Glencore is gaining traction, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions. The Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts despite slowing job growth, while India’s 7.4% GDP growth fuels debate over its sustainability. In credit markets, Saks Global teeters on bankruptcy, and Trump’s proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates draws sharp criticism from banks.
