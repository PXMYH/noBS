## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic policy shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is reportedly considering a temporary suspension of the sales tax on food as part of her election campaign, signaling potential economic relief ahead of an expected parliamentary dissolution. Meanwhile, the U.S. under President Donald Trump continues to make bold moves, halting immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The administration also warns of heightened military activity in the Pacific near Latin American nations, with the FAA issuing advisories for pilots to avoid certain oceanic regions. On the energy front, Venezuela secures its first LPG export deal under Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage with Trump’s push for Venezuelan oil, preferring domestic sources. Diplomatically, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to strengthen Canada-China relations amid worsening U.S.-China ties, reflecting a broader realignment in global trade dynamics.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are navigating a mix of political and economic pressures as President Trump's disruptive agenda rattles Wall Street. The Justice Department's criminal subpoena of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Trump's push for a 10% credit card interest rate cap have sparked concerns over central bank independence and financial sector stability. Despite these tensions, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson asserts that current monetary policy is 'well positioned,' though traders now expect no rate cuts before June. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal mixed results: while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs outperformed expectations, major banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America fell short amid regulatory uncertainty. In other developments, Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong Wegovy sales, and York Space Systems filed for a $544 million IPO, signaling continued investor appetite for defense and biotech sectors. The bankruptcy of Saks, following its troubled acquisition of Neiman Marcus, underscores retail sector struggles, while Ecuador's planned return to global debt markets highlights shifting emerging market dynamics.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with Aldi and other value-focused retailers drawing shoppers away from traditional supermarkets. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push consumers across income levels to prioritize affordability without sacrificing quality. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further intensifying pressure on established grocers to adapt. The expansion also signals confidence in the discounter's long-term growth, with plans to strengthen its footprint in both urban and suburban markets.
