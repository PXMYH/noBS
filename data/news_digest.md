## 🌍 World & Politics

President Trump's first year in office continues to dominate headlines, with economists warning that his policies may weaken the U.S. economy in the long term despite minimal immediate impact. His aggressive trade stance remains a focal point, as courts consider curtailing his tariff authority even as he escalates threats of a new trade war. Meanwhile, Congress advances a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown by the January 31 deadline, offering a rare moment of cross-party cooperation amid ongoing political tensions. Domestically, Minnesota braces for an economic blackout protest on Friday, with labor unions and faith groups urging residents to halt work, shopping, and school attendance in response to a surge in federal immigration enforcement following a high-profile killing. Internationally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity over parts of the Pacific near Latin American countries, including Mexico and Colombia, advising pilots to exercise caution. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to USDT stablecoins as a hedge against economic instability, while Trump's push to exploit the country's oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, who view domestic production as a safer alternative.
