## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. launches a major military operation in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a predawn raid. President Trump declares the U.S. will temporarily govern Venezuela until a stable transition can be arranged, with American oil companies poised to invest billions in rebuilding the country’s oil infrastructure. The move prompts Venezuela to accuse the U.S. of aggression, while the FAA closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights. Despite the geopolitical upheaval, oil markets remain largely unaffected, with analysts suggesting global supplies can absorb any short-term disruptions. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Western nations escalate, as Beijing threatens to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s visit to Taiwan and imposes a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s stance on Taiwan. These developments underscore a volatile geopolitical landscape marked by U.S. interventionism and China’s assertive diplomatic tactics.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh geopolitical risks, central bank policies, and corporate shifts. OPEC+ maintains steady oil output amid supply surplus concerns, while Saudi Arabia signals a slowdown in international bond issuance. The Federal Reserve faces internal divisions over further rate cuts, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson suggesting modest reductions later in the year if economic conditions remain stable. Meanwhile, Wall Street extends its 2025 rally, buoyed by tech stocks and AI-driven credit markets, though valuations and inflation risks loom. Corporate activity includes leadership changes at Berkshire Hathaway and Saks Global, which is reportedly preparing for bankruptcy, while SpaceX's anticipated IPO emerges as a potential market-defining event. Commodities see volatility, with silver futures retreating sharply after record highs, and China's move to restrict silver exports adds to supply chain uncertainties.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by shifting dynamics in electric vehicles, AI, and global trade. China's BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world's top EV seller, reflecting broader challenges in the sector as growth slows and automakers pivot back to gas-powered trucks and SUVs. Meanwhile, AI continues to drive market optimism, with emerging-market stocks hitting a five-year high on bets around Asia's AI expansion, though concerns about an AI bubble persist. Regulatory pressures are also intensifying, as China cracks down on AI chatbots and the U.S. faces legal challenges from renewable energy firms like Ørsted over policy shifts. In corporate news, Uber restructures contracts to avoid UK taxes, while Paramount secures backing from Larry Ellison in its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. The global economy remains volatile, with geopolitical tensions—such as the U.S. capture of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro—and trade disputes adding uncertainty to markets and supply chains.
