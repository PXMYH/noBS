## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and economic shifts dominate this week's headlines, with President Trump's aggressive trade policies and geopolitical maneuvers taking center stage. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's renouncement of liberal democratic principles and threats of new tariffs—including potential levies on European wine—signal a further retreat from U.S. leadership in the global economy, a void China appears poised to fill. Meanwhile, Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, emphasizes that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding negotiations over the war in Ukraine, while also highlighting investment opportunities in the war-torn nation. Domestically, Trump's push for U.S. investment in Venezuela clashes with lingering sanctions, complicating business prospects in the South American country. Back in the U.S., mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations, accusing the agency of constitutional violations. Elsewhere, France grapples with fiscal challenges, as Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau criticizes the government’s minimal efforts to reduce the deficit, while President Macron’s sunglasses unexpectedly steal the spotlight at Davos.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets experienced heightened volatility this week as President Trump's unpredictable policy shifts—including abrupt tariff threats on European wine and a sudden reversal on Greenland-related measures—sparked sharp selloffs and rapid rebounds. The S&P 500 posted its first two-week loss since June, while silver surged past $100 an ounce and gold saw increased bullish bets amid geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, the dollar suffered its worst week since May, and speculation grew over potential yen intervention by Japan, possibly with U.S. support. Corporate developments included Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex, SpaceX's preparations for a blockbuster IPO, and BlackRock's 19% writedown on a troubled private debt fund, underscoring rising concerns in the private credit sector. The Federal Reserve remained a focal point, with Trump escalating pressure on the central bank and the Supreme Court signaling unease over threats to its independence.

## 💻 Technology

This week's tech and business landscape is dominated by AI's growing influence and its economic ripple effects. The IMF warns that AI could disrupt 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with young workers facing the brunt of the impact, while Big Tech ramps up debt issuance to fund AI ambitions, hitting a record $108.7 billion in Q4 bonds. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's planned visit to China underscores the high stakes in AI chip markets, as sales stall amid geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, TikTok's corporate restructuring in the U.S. raises questions about data sovereignty, with several major firms—some linked to the Trump administration—now owning stakes in the platform. Beyond AI, regulatory pressures intensify: the FCC cracks down on late-night TV political appearances, and the Supreme Court appears skeptical of Trump's attempt to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, signaling potential limits on executive overreach. In corporate moves, Netflix's ad strategy pays off with $1.5 billion in 2025 revenue, while Paramount bets on European regulators to block a Warner Bros. Discovery-Netflix deal. The mining sector also sees a surge, driven by AI's insatiable demand for metals, with seabed mining accelerating under new U.S. rules.
