## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with aggressive moves in Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers—including a Russian-flagged vessel—and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The White House claims Venezuela will continue supplying oil to the U.S. indefinitely, easing some sanctions while tightening its grip on the nation’s energy sector. The intervention sparks mixed reactions among Trump’s allies, with some MAGA media figures breaking from their anti-interventionist stance to support the action. Meanwhile, China faces economic and diplomatic fallout from Maduro’s removal, as Beijing’s long-standing oil deals with Venezuela hang in the balance and online debates erupt over parallels to Taiwan. Domestically, Trump pushes Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases and vows to crack down on defense contractors’ executive pay amid plans to boost military spending to $1.5 trillion. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing Russian strikes, while the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights amid the Venezuela operation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, central bank signals, and corporate shifts in early 2026. A rally in government bonds, including Treasuries and Australian debt, reflects dovish monetary policy expectations, while stocks face pressure from weak U.S. economic data and rising uncertainties. The Federal Reserve's independence is under scrutiny as political pressures mount, with former Vice Chair Lael Brainard emphasizing its importance for dollar stability. Meanwhile, Venezuela dominates energy and commodity headlines, as the U.S. tightens control over its oil sales and investors bet on the country's bonds amid political transitions. In corporate news, JPMorgan Chase takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking a strategic shift in consumer finance, while SpaceX's anticipated IPO looms as a potential blockbuster event. The commercial real estate sector shows signs of stabilization, though regional shifts in migration patterns are reshaping demand. Elsewhere, China's export restrictions on silver and its push to promote Hainan as a duty-free hub underscore its evolving trade strategy, while corporate struggles—like the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's shutdown and Saks Global's leadership shakeup—highlight ongoing economic challenges.
