## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate headlines as the Trump administration pushes aggressive economic and military strategies. In Latin America, the U.S. is making bold moves in Venezuela, with President Trump urging oil executives to invest in the country’s reserves despite widespread skepticism from industry leaders. The administration claims Venezuela will relinquish up to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., though negotiations remain unresolved. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipment to Cuba escalates tensions with Washington, highlighting the region’s shifting alliances as China maintains its strong economic foothold in Latin America. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, while China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister’s visit to Taiwan, underscoring Beijing’s assertive stance on sovereignty issues. Domestically, Trump seeks expanded powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls on Congress to curb Wall Street’s purchase of single-family homes, aiming to address housing affordability. The fallout from Venezuela’s political upheaval also sparks debates over U.S. intervention, with prediction markets and commodity traders closely watching the unfolding situation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with a mix of caution and opportunity as geopolitical tensions and central bank policies shape investor sentiment. Defense stocks surge in Europe and Asia amid rising instability, while gold remains a favored safe haven despite its record 2025 rally. The Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts after December’s jobs report shows slowing payroll growth, reinforcing expectations of a measured approach to monetary easing. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal mixed fortunes: General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back EV ambitions, while IMAX thrives as a standout in the entertainment sector. Mergers and acquisitions dominate headlines, with Rio Tinto and Glencore reviving talks for a $260 billion mining mega-deal, and JPMorgan Chase taking over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs. President Trump’s aggressive energy policies, including plans to leverage Venezuela’s oil reserves to drive prices down to $50 a barrel, spark both skepticism and market speculation, though oil executives remain wary of the country’s instability. In Asia, India’s 7.4% GDP growth draws scrutiny over its sustainability, while Hong Kong eyes a budget surplus from higher stock trading stamp duties. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though Trump’s push for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds revives memories of the 2008 crisis.
