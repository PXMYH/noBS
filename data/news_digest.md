## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as Europe weighs responses to US President Donald Trump’s aggressive stance on Greenland’s sovereignty, with debates emerging over potential economic countermeasures, including the use of US assets. Meanwhile, Trump’s self-declared authority over Venezuela raises concerns, as his push to exploit the country’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major energy firms, who prefer domestic sources. The FAA’s recent warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace further highlight regional instability, coinciding with Venezuela’s economic turmoil, where citizens increasingly rely on USDT stablecoins to shield against hyperinflation and political uncertainty. In other news, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy steps down, marking a leadership shift in the entertainment industry.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are on edge as escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe over Greenland send shockwaves through equities, commodities, and currencies. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and push to annex Greenland have driven gold and silver to record highs, while Asian and European stocks face pressure amid fears of a prolonged trade war. Meanwhile, central banks are increasingly turning to gold as a hedge against volatility, with Serbia’s central bank among those bolstering reserves. In corporate news, Henkel is in talks to acquire Dutch chemical maker Stahl, while Novo Nordisk shares surged 8% on strong early sales of its obesity drug Wegovy. The Federal Reserve remains in the spotlight as a Justice Department investigation into Chair Jerome Powell complicates Trump’s efforts to replace him, with economic adviser Kevin Hassett downplaying the probe’s significance. Elsewhere, Brazil’s finance chief advocates for central bank oversight of investment funds, and China’s real estate slump continues to weigh on growth despite a rebound in exports.
