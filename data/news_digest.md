## 🌍 World & Politics

The geopolitical landscape is dominated by the U.S. ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who now faces trial in New York after a dramatic capture. The move, orchestrated by President Donald Trump, has sent shockwaves through global markets, with Venezuela’s bonds surging as investors anticipate potential debt recovery. However, uncertainty looms over Venezuela’s future governance and its oil industry, a critical sector with vast reserves but dwindling production. The intervention also strains U.S.-China relations, as Beijing’s oil-backed loans to Caracas hang in the balance, reflecting broader great-power competition. Meanwhile, China’s diplomatic tensions escalate, with threats to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit and a ban on Japanese scallops as retaliation for perceived support of Taiwan. Domestically, Trump’s policies continue to reshape U.S. institutions, from defunding public media to downsizing the federal workforce, leaving long-term efficiency concerns. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka exporter Nemiroff, press on amid ongoing conflict, while European defense stocks rise amid heightened geopolitical risks.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kick off 2026 with mixed signals as commodities surge while economic uncertainties linger. Copper hits a record high above $13,000 per ton, driven by tight supplies and strong U.S. demand, while silver retreats sharply after a volatile rally. Asian equities, led by Chinese stocks, reach multi-year highs on AI optimism and signs of economic recovery, though China's steel sector faces prolonged margin pressures due to slower-than-expected capacity cuts. In corporate news, Hg Capital nears a deal to take OneStream private, and BlueScope Steel shares jump after an $8.8 billion takeover bid. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve remains divided on further rate cuts, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggesting limited need for deeper reductions. Geopolitical risks, including Venezuela's oil output challenges and Saudi Arabia's price cuts, add to market volatility, while Mexico's $9 billion bond sale highlights robust emerging-market debt activity.
