## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines as leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos. President Donald Trump’s administration faces scrutiny over its trade policies, with economists warning of long-term economic consequences despite minimal immediate impact. Trump’s keynote speech at Davos signals a retreat from liberal democratic norms, potentially ceding global economic leadership to China, which strengthens ties with Argentina under President Javier Milei. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Taras Kachka emphasizes security and European integration amid ongoing geopolitical challenges, while Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya criticizes President Alexander Lukashenko’s regime following the release of political prisoners. Domestically, the U.S. Congress avoids a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though protests erupt in Minnesota over federal immigration enforcement. In Venezuela, locals increasingly rely on USDT stablecoins as economic instability persists, highlighting broader trends in unstable regimes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets rebounded on Thursday after President Trump softened his stance on tariffs and Greenland, easing tensions that had triggered sharp sell-offs earlier in the week. European stocks rose, and the dollar stabilized as risk sentiment improved, though concerns linger about the Fed's independence amid Trump's pressure campaign. In corporate news, Procter & Gamble beat earnings estimates but reported weaker-than-expected revenue, while Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong Wegovy sales. Meanwhile, Davos discussions highlighted economic uncertainty, with leaders like Argentina's President Milei advocating for free trade and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warning against undermining Fed autonomy. Elsewhere, China's real estate slump continues to weigh on growth, and Colombia escalated trade tensions with Ecuador by halting power exports and imposing tariffs.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape is buzzing with major developments, from AI-driven market shifts to high-stakes corporate maneuvers. A relief rally in stocks gains momentum, fueled by optimism around AI investments and President Trump’s pivot on Greenland, while tech giants like Netflix and United Airlines report strong earnings. Netflix’s $1.5 billion ad revenue in 2025 and its all-cash $83 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery highlight the streaming wars’ escalation, while General Fusion’s $1 billion SPAC deal marks a milestone for nuclear fusion technology. Meanwhile, regulatory tensions rise as the FCC revisits the ‘equal time’ rule for political candidates on talk shows, targeting late-night hosts like Colbert and Kimmel, and a federal judge blocks prosecutors from reviewing materials seized from a Washington Post reporter. AI’s influence extends beyond markets, with job applicants suing an AI recruitment tool company over alleged discriminatory algorithms, and facial recognition becoming ubiquitous in travel, despite privacy concerns. At Davos, AI and Big Tech dominate discussions, with smaller firms emerging as key players in the AI supply chain, while China’s plunging birthrate and Japan’s nuclear restart underscore global economic and energy shifts.
