## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Financial markets are navigating a mix of corporate resilience and policy uncertainty as major banks report strong earnings amid restructuring efforts. Bank of America and Citigroup both surpassed estimates, with Citigroup's advisory fees surging 84% in Q4, while JPMorgan Chase faces pressure from potential credit card rate caps proposed by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is under scrutiny as a DOJ probe raises questions about his congressional testimony, drawing global central bank support for Fed independence. Commodities are rallying, with gold, silver, and copper hitting record highs, while OPEC projects steady oil demand growth into 2027. However, economic risks loom as the World Economic Forum highlights geopolitical conflicts and tariffs as top business concerns, and Saks Global's bankruptcy underscores retail sector struggles. The U.S. economy shows mixed signals, with inflation holding steady at 2.7% and mortgage rates dropping to near 2022 lows, but corporate optimism contrasts with household pessimism.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with Aldi and other value-focused retailers gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures drive consumers to prioritize affordability without sacrificing quality. Aldi's expansion strategy includes both new locations and remodels of existing stores, further intensifying pressure on traditional supermarkets to adapt to shifting consumer preferences.

## 📰 Other News

Economic pressures and policy shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with housing affordability emerging as a central theme. President Trump faces criticism as his administration’s housing policies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s retreat from low-income assistance, clash with rising costs. Meanwhile, the CPI report reveals sharp increases in food prices, exacerbating financial strain for families already cutting back on child care and other essentials. The Supreme Court’s growing favoritism toward wealthy litigants and California’s controversial billionaire tax proposal further highlight the nation’s deepening economic divide. Internationally, the EU and South America’s landmark free-trade agreement contrasts with the U.S.’s more coercive trade tactics, while China’s state media amplifies narratives of American poverty to deflect from domestic challenges. On a lighter note, the revival of *Gourmet Magazine* as an unsanctioned newsletter and the Golden Globes’ first-ever podcast category signal cultural shifts in media consumption. Emerging trends in AI, like PixVerse’s real-time video tool, and the bumpy rollout of psychedelic therapy underscore the tension between innovation and accessibility.
