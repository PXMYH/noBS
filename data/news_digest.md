## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as President Trump threatens a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa pursues a trade deal with China, signaling a potential new trade war. Meanwhile, Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, asserts that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding Ukraine negotiations, while Trump also hints at U.S. plans to process seized Venezuelan oil despite lingering sanctions. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota against ICE operations, with organizers demanding the agency’s removal from the state.
