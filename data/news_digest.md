## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with aggressive moves in Venezuela, seizing two oil tankers and asserting control over the country’s oil sales after the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The White House plans to lift some sanctions to maintain Venezuelan oil flows, but the intervention sparks debate among Trump’s allies and disrupts global markets, with airlines canceling flights due to Caribbean airspace closures. Meanwhile, China faces economic strain as Venezuela’s political upheaval threatens its oil investments, while Beijing’s diplomatic tensions with the UK resurface over Taiwan. On the domestic front, Trump pushes Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases and targets defense contractors over executive pay, even as he proposes a record $1.5 trillion military budget. Elsewhere, Japan’s defense stocks surge amid rising geopolitical tensions, and Ukrainian businesses like Nemiroff vodka adapt to wartime challenges by expanding exports despite ongoing conflict.
