## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. The US-China relationship remains strained, with former diplomat William Klein highlighting the impact of President Trump’s tariffs on Iran’s trading partners, while China’s threat to cancel UK trade talks over a minister’s Taiwan visit underscores Beijing’s sensitivity to diplomatic provocations. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s gradual release of US prisoners signals a potential thaw in relations, though Trump’s push to exploit Venezuelan oil resources faces skepticism from US energy executives and risks exacerbating a global supply glut. In Japan, fiscal concerns escalate as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s snap election plans trigger a surge in bond yields, reflecting investor unease. On the military front, the US intensifies pressure on illicit oil trade by seizing tankers, prompting a shadow fleet to seek Russian protection, while Trump’s executive order targets underperforming defense contractors to accelerate weapons production.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of economic optimism and political tensions as 2026 begins. Inflation in the U.S. held steady at 2.7% in December, fueling bets on potential Fed rate cuts later in the year, though a top Fed official signaled little urgency for immediate action. The Fed faces unprecedented pressure as the Justice Department launches a criminal investigation into Chair Jerome Powell, sparking a rare show of solidarity from global central banks defending the Fed’s independence. Meanwhile, commodity markets are surging, with tin and copper hitting record highs, while silver topped $90 an ounce for the first time, driven by Fed rate-cut expectations and geopolitical uncertainties. In Asia, Japan’s bond demand weakened amid political risks, and South Korea’s won neared a 17-year low, prompting intervention concerns. Corporate earnings kicked off with JPMorgan beating estimates, though Delta Air Lines’ cautious 2026 forecast weighed on travel stocks. China’s record $1.19 trillion trade surplus underscored its export dominance, while global funds ramped up bets on Chinese stocks and the yuan. President Trump’s economic policies, including a proposed 10% cap on credit card rates and tariff threats, are stirring market volatility and corporate pushback, with banks warning of potential fallout.
