## 🌍 World & Politics

The geopolitical landscape is dominated by the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which has sent shockwaves through global markets and diplomatic circles. Maduro’s ouster, now facing trial in New York, has triggered debates in China about political power and Taiwan, while bondholders scramble to assess the fallout on Venezuela’s $60 billion in defaulted debt. The move also strains China’s oil-backed loans to Caracas and raises questions about Beijing’s broader strategy amid U.S. assertions in Latin America. Meanwhile, financial markets remain resilient under President Trump’s unorthodox policies, with defense stocks and precious metals surging amid heightened tensions. Elsewhere, China’s economic and diplomatic pressures intensify, from threatening trade talks with the UK over Taiwan to banning Japanese scallops in a tit-for-tat dispute. Domestic U.S. policies, including defunding public broadcasting and federal workforce cuts, further underscore Trump’s transformative impact on governance.

Asian equities, led by Chinese tech stocks, rally to multi-year highs on optimism over AI advancements and signs of economic recovery, though China's steel sector faces prolonged margin pressure due to slower-than-expected capacity cuts. In corporate news, Jollibee Foods plans a U.S. IPO for its global business by 2027, while Saks Global faces leadership changes amid bankruptcy rumors.
