## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week, with President Trump's aggressive trade policies and diplomatic maneuvers taking center stage. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump's threats to impose new tariffs on European wine and his controversial meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy underscore his confrontational approach to international relations. Meanwhile, Chrystia Freeland, now an economic adviser to Zelenskiy, emphasizes that the 'ball is in Putin’s court' regarding Ukraine negotiations, highlighting the stalled progress in resolving the conflict. Back in the U.S., domestic unrest flares as tens of thousands of Minnesotans stage a strike to protest ICE operations, demanding the agency's removal from the state. Economically, China stands to benefit as Trump's protectionist policies alienate traditional allies, while Venezuela's unstable economy drives locals to adopt cryptocurrencies like USDT for financial security. The Pentagon's attempt to exert control over the military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* also sparks debate over press freedom within the armed forces.
