## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with trade and sanctions emerging as key flashpoints. Malaysia’s government announces a cost-benefit review of its controversial trade deal with the U.S., signaling cautious engagement amid domestic skepticism, while President Trump escalates threats of a new trade war even as courts weigh curtailing his tariff authority. The U.S. also faces internal unrest, with tens of thousands in Minnesota staging strikes and economic blackouts to protest ICE’s expanded operations, demanding the agency’s removal from the state. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains between China and Japan deepen as Chinese tourism plummets following Tokyo’s warning that a Taiwan invasion could trigger Japanese military action, underscoring the fragile balance in East Asia. Financial repercussions of sanctions also make waves, with the UK fining Bank of Scotland £160,000 for facilitating transactions for a sanctioned Putin ally, and Venezuela’s economic instability driving locals toward cryptocurrencies like USDT as a hedge against government volatility.
