## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as China reaffirms its opposition to the use of force in international relations, following U.S. threats against Iran amid Tehran’s crackdown on protesters. Beijing’s stance underscores its broader diplomatic strategy, which also includes threats to cancel trade talks with the UK after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting China’s sensitivity over the island’s status. Meanwhile, economic maneuvering takes center stage as Hungary’s Mol nears a deal to acquire Gazprom’s stake in a sanctioned Serbian refinery, reflecting the shifting energy landscape amid U.S. sanctions on Russia. In Venezuela, Donald Trump’s push to assert control over the country’s oil resources draws skepticism from major oil giants, with analysts questioning the feasibility and economic wisdom of such a move. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war disruptions, while Canada’s former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to mend frayed Canada-China relations as the U.S. outlook darkens.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Wall Street banks are navigating a mix of strong earnings and regulatory uncertainty as President Trump's policies continue to roil markets. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both surpassed profit estimates, driven by robust equities trading and wealth management performance, while Citigroup and Bank of America also posted better-than-expected results. However, banks are bracing for potential disruptions as Trump revives a push to cap credit card interest rates, sparking industry pushback and lobbying efforts. Meanwhile, corporate America faces mixed fortunes: Saks Global filed for bankruptcy after its debt-laden acquisition of Neiman Marcus collapsed, while Netflix is reportedly shifting to an all-cash offer to accelerate its $83 billion takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery. Global economic tensions remain elevated, with China posting a record trade surplus and the World Economic Forum warning that geoeconomic conflicts pose the greatest near-term risk to businesses. Commodities markets are reacting to geopolitical signals, with oil prices falling after Trump indicated a pause on potential Iran strikes, and silver retreating from record highs following a delay in critical mineral tariffs.
