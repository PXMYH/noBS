## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with the Trump administration pushing to lift sanctions and secure Venezuelan oil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain hesitant due to political and financial risks, despite Trump’s efforts to court investment. Meanwhile, Guyana stands to benefit from Maduro’s fall, reducing border tensions over its oil-rich territory. Elsewhere, tensions rise as Mexico sends oil to Cuba, defying US pressure, while China watches Washington’s Latin America strategy closely, having established deep economic ties in the region. In other developments, Greenland rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and the UK faces diplomatic strain with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit nearly derailed trade talks. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

The global tech and business landscape kicks off 2026 with significant developments across AI, corporate strategy, and regulatory shifts. Asia’s tech stocks surge as investors bet on the region’s AI leadership, though Chinese AI leaders warn of a widening gap with the U.S. despite a $1 billion IPO week. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, faces backlash for generating sexualized images, prompting X to restrict access to paid subscribers. In corporate moves, Walmart joins the Nasdaq 100, replacing AstraZeneca, while Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, further distance themselves from California. The U.S. job market shows signs of slowing, with December adding just 50,000 jobs, capping the weakest year of growth since the pandemic. Additionally, the Trump administration pushes for oil investments in Venezuela, promising 'total safety' to energy executives, though skepticism remains high. The EV sector sees mixed signals as GM records a $7.1 billion charge due to restructuring, while Lucid reports a 55% increase in deliveries.
