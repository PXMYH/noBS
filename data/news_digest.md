## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions and domestic unrest dominate headlines as President Trump's policies reshape international relations. At the World Economic Forum, Trump's rejection of liberal democratic principles signals a shift in U.S. leadership, ceding ground to China in the global economy. Meanwhile, his administration faces legal challenges over tariff authority, even as he pushes for U.S. investment in Venezuela despite lingering sanctions that complicate business opportunities. Back home, mass protests erupt in Minnesota, with tens of thousands demanding ICE's withdrawal from the state amid allegations of constitutional violations. In France, President Macron's Davos appearance—marked by his now-famous sunglasses—overshadows broader geopolitical discussions, while Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT as a hedge against volatility. The Pentagon's crackdown on the *Stars and Stripes* military newspaper, criticized as 'woke,' sparks a pushback from Congress and the outlet's leadership, underscoring tensions over media independence.

The S&P 500 logged its second consecutive weekly decline, with President Trump's abrupt tariff threats against Europe triggering synchronized selloffs before a partial rebound. The dollar suffered its worst week since May, boosting the yen and other currencies amid speculation of Japanese intervention, while gold and silver surged to multi-year highs as investors sought safe havens. Meanwhile, corporate activity remained brisk, with Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech Brex and SpaceX's reported preparations for a blockbuster IPO. In commodities, oil prices climbed due to U.S. winter storm disruptions and renewed Iran tensions, while a private credit meltdown looms as BlackRock's debt fund faces a 19% asset value cut.

## 💻 Technology

This week’s tech and business headlines are dominated by major AI advancements and regulatory shifts. Tesla makes waves by removing safety drivers from its robotaxis in Austin, signaling a bold step forward in autonomous transportation, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s upcoming visit to China underscores the company’s push to revive stalled AI chip sales amid geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, TikTok restructures its U.S. operations, spinning off an American entity to comply with regulatory pressures, though questions remain about how this will impact its 200 million American users. In corporate leadership, Apple’s expansion of hardware chief John Ternus’s role hints at succession planning as Tim Cook’s potential successor, while Big Tech’s record $108.7 billion in bond issuances highlights the financial strain of funding AI ambitions. The IMF warns of AI’s disruptive impact on labor markets, predicting 60% of jobs in advanced economies could be affected, with young workers bearing the brunt. Beyond tech, a winter storm disrupts travel, and Trump’s unpredictable policies—from Greenland threats to Fed chair speculation—keep markets and allies on edge.

## ⚽ Sports

LIV Golf, the Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league, continues to strengthen its ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s business empire. The league announces it will host a tournament at the Trump Organization’s New Jersey resort, marking at least the sixth event held at a Trump property in the past four years. This partnership underscores LIV Golf’s strategy of aligning with high-profile venues and figures, despite ongoing political and ethical debates surrounding its Saudi funding. The move also highlights the league’s efforts to solidify its presence in the U.S. golf market, even as traditional tours like the PGA maintain a cautious distance. Meanwhile, the decision reignites discussions about the intersection of sports, politics, and business, particularly as LIV Golf expands its global footprint.
