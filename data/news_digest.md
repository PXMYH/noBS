## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela, where the Trump administration is pushing to lift sanctions and secure oil deals following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicates sanctions relief could come as early as next week, while major oil traders like Vitol and Trafigura explore US refiner interest in Venezuelan crude. However, oil executives remain cautious amid political uncertainty, and Trump’s $100 billion investment plan faces skepticism. The shift in Venezuela also eases tensions for Guyana, which stands to benefit from reduced border-conflict risks. Meanwhile, China watches closely as its long-standing economic influence in the region faces US competition. Elsewhere, Greenland firmly rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and the UK navigates diplomatic tensions with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit threatened trade talks. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors over delays and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical shifts, economic policy changes, and corporate maneuvers in early 2026. Venezuela dominates headlines as its bonds surge following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro, sparking both investor optimism and skepticism over U.S. plans to revitalize its oil sector. President Trump’s aggressive push to leverage Venezuela’s crude reserves—aiming to slash oil prices to $50 a barrel—faces resistance from major oil firms like Exxon, which demand significant reforms before committing capital. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy shows signs of cooling inflation, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance on rate cuts, though December’s jobs data suggests policymakers will wait for clearer signs of labor market weakness before easing further. In corporate news, Rio Tinto and Glencore restart merger talks, potentially creating the world’s largest mining giant, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss as it scales back electric vehicle ambitions amid shifting federal policies. Gold remains a bright spot, with investors betting on sustained gains after its record 2025 rally, and defense stocks rally as global tensions fuel demand. Elsewhere, China’s consumer trends lean toward experiential spending, and India’s low inflation underpins its status as the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
