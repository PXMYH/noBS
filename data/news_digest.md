## 🌍 World & Politics

Global tensions escalate as geopolitical shifts and economic pressures dominate headlines. China's potential move on Taiwan remains a critical concern amid broader instability, with recent U.S. military actions in Venezuela and Greenland further straining international norms. Meanwhile, India's state refiner BPCL is pivoting back to Middle Eastern crude, reducing reliance on Russian oil, while China's access to cheap Venezuelan oil nears its end as the last sanctioned tankers arrive. Domestically, President Trump's aggressive trade policies and economic strategies face legal challenges, though his threats of a new trade war persist. Congress, however, appears poised to avoid a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal. In Venezuela, economic turmoil drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT for stability, while the FAA warns of heightened military activity in Latin American airspace, reflecting broader regional instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reeling from heightened volatility driven by geopolitical tensions and central bank uncertainty. A meltdown in Japanese government bonds (JGBs) has sent shockwaves through credit markets, prompting China’s state-owned oil firm to shelve a bond sale and raising fears of a $130 billion Treasury selloff. Meanwhile, US stocks suffered their worst day since October after President Trump’s threats of new tariffs over Greenland rattled investors, sending oil prices lower while gold and platinum surged to record highs. The Indian rupee hit a fresh low amid persistent capital outflows, and Reliance Industries faced its deepest oversold level in years due to retail slowdowns and US scrutiny over Russian oil purchases. In corporate news, Netflix sweetened its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while Novo Nordisk shares jumped 8% on strong demand for its obesity drug Wegovy. Central banks remain in focus, with China weakening the yuan’s fix to curb gains and the Fed’s leadership in flux as Trump weighs replacements for Jerome Powell.
