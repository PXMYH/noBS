## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. The US intensifies pressure on illicit oil trade, seizing tankers linked to Venezuela and prompting a 'dark fleet' of vessels to seek Russian flag protection. Meanwhile, President Trump's push to revive Venezuela's oil sector faces skepticism from US energy executives, with analysts warning it could exacerbate a global supply glut and undermine domestic fracking industries. In Asia, Japan's bond yields surge to a 26-year high amid fiscal concerns and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's reported plans for a snap election, while Colombia secures $5 billion in global bonds ahead of pivotal elections. Diplomatic strains persist as China threatens to derail UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit, underscoring Beijing's sensitivity to Taiwan-related engagements. On the military front, Trump seeks expanded powers to penalize underperforming defense contractors, signaling frustration with weapons delivery delays.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are reacting to mixed economic signals as 2026 begins, with inflation holding steady at 2.7% in December, reinforcing trader bets on a Fed rate cut by June. Stocks slid on the CPI report, while precious metals surged—silver hit a record high and gold rose amid geopolitical tensions and rate-cut expectations. The Fed faces mounting pressure as a DOJ probe into Chair Jerome Powell sparks global concern over central bank independence, with former officials and foreign counterparts rallying to his defense. Meanwhile, corporate activity remains brisk: U.S. Bancorp announced a $1 billion acquisition of BTIG, and Blackstone-backed Liftoff Mobile filed for a U.S. IPO. In commodities, tin soared above $51,000 per ton, driven by Chinese demand, while oil markets eye Venezuela’s potential long-term recovery. Political risks loom as Trump’s proposed credit card rate cap threatens a $70 billion debt market, and his trade tariffs face legal challenges. Global investors are also pivoting toward Chinese stocks and the yuan, signaling cautious optimism despite broader economic uncertainties.
