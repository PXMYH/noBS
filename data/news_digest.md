## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week. President Donald Trump escalates rhetoric against Iran, driving oil prices above $61 per barrel amid fears of supply disruptions, while simultaneously pushing a controversial $100 billion plan to tap Venezuela’s oil reserves—a move met with skepticism from U.S. energy executives and criticism for its potential to undermine domestic shale producers already struggling with oversupply. Meanwhile, Colombia secures $5 billion in global bonds ahead of pivotal elections, reflecting broader emerging-market efforts to capitalize on favorable borrowing conditions. In Europe, China’s threat to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s Taiwan visit underscores Beijing’s assertive stance on sovereignty, while Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war challenges. Domestically, Trump’s executive order targeting 'underperforming' defense contractors signals a harder line on military-industrial efficiency, though its impact remains uncertain.

## 📰 Other News

This week's news highlights a mix of economic pressures, corporate maneuvering, and cultural shifts. Inflation remains a dominant concern, with food prices surging in December, particularly for beef, coffee, and produce, while housing affordability continues to strain American households. President Trump's administration is taking aggressive steps to combat rising costs, including threats to lower prices and exploring housing solutions, though critics question the effectiveness of these measures. Meanwhile, the healthcare sector sees significant developments: Novo Nordisk's CEO touts strong demand for its obesity pill Wegovy, while psilocybin therapy faces a slow, expensive rollout despite legalization in three states. Corporate activity is also notable, with Allegiant Airlines acquiring Sun Country in a $1.5 billion deal and Paramount escalating its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On the cultural front, the Golden Globes introduces a best podcast category, reflecting the medium's growing influence, while Neon, an indie studio, leads nominations with a slate of non-English films. Internationally, the EU and South America finalize a massive free-trade agreement, contrasting with the U.S.'s more coercive economic strategies. Human interest stories, such as the revival of Gourmet Magazine as an unsanctioned newsletter and the late David Mitchell's fight against drug prices, add depth to the week's narratives.
