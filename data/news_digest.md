## 🌍 World & Politics

The US is making significant moves in Latin America following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with the Trump administration pushing to lift sanctions and secure Venezuelan oil reserves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signals potential sanctions relief to facilitate oil sales, while major trading firms like Vitol and Trafigura explore deals with US refiners. However, oil executives remain cautious about investing in Venezuela despite Trump’s $100 billion plan, citing political and financial risks. The shift in Caracas has also eased tensions for Guyana, which faces less border conflict risk amid its booming oil sector. Meanwhile, Mexico’s oil shipments to Cuba are escalating US-Cuba tensions, highlighting the region’s shifting alliances. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and China warns the UK over Taiwan-related diplomatic disputes, underscoring broader geopolitical friction. Domestically, Trump seeks new powers to pressure defense contractors and calls for Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases, reflecting his economic priorities.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets open 2026 with cautious optimism as inflation trends show signs of stabilization, though risks linger. U.S. inflation remains subdued, reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s patient stance on rate cuts, while Egypt’s steady inflation raises hopes for further monetary easing. However, corporate bond markets face pressure as more firms teeter on the edge of junk status, and defense stocks rally amid geopolitical tensions. In corporate news, Rio Tinto and Glencore revive merger talks in a potential $260 billion deal that could reshape the mining sector, while General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive push into Venezuela’s oil industry sparks skepticism from energy giants like Exxon, which deem the country 'uninvestable' without major reforms. Gold investors remain bullish after a record 2025 rally, and BlackRock predicts a surge in retail crypto adoption this year. The housing market shows signs of balancing, though institutional buyers continue to dominate key U.S. metros.
