## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures dominate global headlines this week. The UK fines Bank of Scotland £160,000 for facilitating banking services for a sanctioned Putin ally, highlighting ongoing enforcement of Western sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile, diplomatic strains between China and Japan escalate as Chinese tourism to Japan plummets following Tokyo’s warnings about potential military involvement in a Taiwan conflict. In the U.S., President Trump’s aggressive trade policies face legal scrutiny, with courts weighing limits on his tariff authority even as he threatens a new trade war. Domestically, mass protests erupt in Minnesota as tens of thousands demand an end to ICE operations, accusing the agency of constitutional violations. Economically, Venezuela’s instability drives locals to adopt USDT stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and political turmoil, while Trump’s push for U.S. investment in the country clashes with lingering sanctions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, monetary policy shifts, and corporate maneuvering. Gold surges past $5,000 an ounce as investors flee to safe havens amid U.S. dollar weakness and rising geopolitical risks, while oil prices fluctuate on supply concerns and extreme weather. Central banks remain in focus, with the ECB warning of inflationary 'pricing cascades' and Japan testing fragile debt markets with a 40-year bond sale. Corporate activity is brisk, highlighted by Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and Zijin Gold's $4 billion African mines deal, though luxury brands and cognac makers face earnings headwinds. Meanwhile, Trump's tariff threats and policy shifts continue to disrupt trade dynamics, particularly with South Korea and Canada, while businesses in the Middle East grow uneasy over Saudi-UAE tensions.

## ⚽ Sports

The Washington Post reverses its earlier decision to skip in-person coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, announcing it will now send a small team of reporters just weeks before the Games begin. The abrupt shift follows initial plans to forgo on-site reporting, highlighting the evolving priorities in sports journalism. Meanwhile, in golf, Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf continues its partnership with the Trump Organization, scheduling another tournament at a Trump-owned resort in New Jersey. This marks at least the sixth event the breakaway league has held at Trump properties in four years, underscoring the ongoing intersection of sports, business, and politics.
