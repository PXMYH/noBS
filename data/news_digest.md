## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic instability dominate global headlines this week. In Venezuela, citizens increasingly turn to Tether's USDT stablecoin as a hedge against political and economic turmoil, reflecting broader distrust in unstable regimes. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer downplays the prospect of retaliatory tariffs against the US amid a diplomatic dispute over Greenland, emphasizing the need for 'calm discussion' to resolve trade friction. The European Central Bank faces a leadership shakeup as finance ministers begin selecting a new vice president, a decision that could shape the future of monetary policy under Christine Lagarde's successor.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are grappling with heightened volatility as trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe escalate. President Trump's threats of tariffs on countries opposing his Greenland acquisition plans have triggered a sell-off in European stocks and U.S. futures, while driving gold and silver to record highs as investors seek safe havens. The euro and Swiss franc have strengthened, but the broader market sentiment remains cautious amid fears of a prolonged trade war. Meanwhile, oil prices have dipped as geopolitical tensions ease, though concerns linger over potential supply disruptions. Central banks, including Romania's, are holding interest rates steady as inflation remains stubbornly high, delaying any easing discussions. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk shares surged 8% after strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug, while Stellantis faces pressure as its turnaround strategy remains under scrutiny. The Fed's independence is also in focus, with markets watching closely as Trump considers potential replacements for Chair Jerome Powell, who has garnered unexpected support amid political pressures.
