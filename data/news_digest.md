## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical and economic tensions dominate this week’s headlines, with major developments in India, the U.S., and Venezuela. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds a significant financial advantage ahead of key state elections, boasting a $1.3 billion cash stockpile—far outpacing its rivals. Meanwhile, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, French President Emmanuel Macron’s appearance with sunglasses to conceal a burst blood vessel overshadowed discussions on pressing geopolitical crises. More substantially, President Trump’s first year in office continues to reshape U.S. economic policy, with economists warning of long-term weakening effects despite minimal immediate changes. His threats of a new trade war persist, even as courts consider curbing his tariff authority. Elsewhere, Venezuela’s economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency, particularly the USDT stablecoin, as a hedge against government volatility. These stories underscore shifting power dynamics, economic uncertainties, and the growing role of alternative financial tools in unstable regimes.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are experiencing significant shifts as investors pivot away from U.S. assets amid geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty. Emerging markets, commodities like gold and copper, and Asian stocks are surging, with gold nearing $5,000 an ounce and copper approaching $13,000 a ton, driven by a weaker dollar and diversification flows. Meanwhile, Japan's bond market is under pressure as the Bank of Japan's inflation outlook flattens the yield curve, while China's central bank injects record liquidity to support growth. Corporate activity remains robust, with major IPOs like Czechoslovak Group's €3.3 billion defense listing and Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex. However, Trump's erratic trade policies and legal battles—including a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan—are adding volatility, though his reversal on European tariffs temporarily eased market concerns.
