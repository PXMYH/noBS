## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend has triggered a major geopolitical shift, with Washington asserting control over Venezuela’s oil sales indefinitely. The Trump administration has seized two tankers, including a Russian-flagged vessel, as part of an intensifying blockade, while Mexico pledges to continue oil shipments to Cuba as humanitarian aid. The move has sparked debates in China, where some view it as a potential blueprint for Taiwan, while others warn of ideological overreach. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, and corporate media outlets are grappling with restricted access under new Pentagon rules. Domestically, the U.S. has defunded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, while global markets react to the Venezuela crisis, with investors like Michael Burry positioning for long-term gains in energy sectors.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are reacting to a mix of geopolitical shifts and economic policy changes, with Venezuela emerging as a central focus. The U.S. is asserting control over Venezuelan oil exports, marketing crude globally and sparking both investor interest and legal complications from firms like Exxon Mobil seeking billions in unpaid debts. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is opening its stock market to all foreign investors to attract capital amid lower oil revenues. In the U.S., stocks are rallying on Big Tech strength, though copper prices retreat from record highs amid profit-taking. The Federal Reserve faces pressure as Trump’s policies test its independence, while corporate America sees high-profile leadership changes, including Warren Buffett’s exit from Berkshire Hathaway and Saks Global’s CEO shakeup ahead of a potential bankruptcy. Elsewhere, Europe sees a record €61 billion in bond sales, and China promotes its duty-free Hainan island amid trade surplus tensions.
