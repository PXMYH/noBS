## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the U.S. intervention in Venezuela sends shockwaves through markets and diplomacy. The ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro triggers economic uncertainty, with traders like Trafigura engaging in talks with Washington to revive oil trade, while China faces potential losses on billions in loans to Caracas. The crisis prompts broader debates in China about political power and Taiwan, as Beijing tightens export controls on Japan over Taiwan-related remarks and bans Japanese scallops in retaliation. Meanwhile, Russia's oil revenues plummet, weakening Putin's war chest amid the Ukraine conflict, while Ukrainian businesses like vodka maker Nemiroff push to expand exports despite ongoing bombings. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, leading to its dissolution, and airlines cancel flights as the FAA closes Caribbean airspace due to military operations in Venezuela.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weighed Federal Reserve policy shifts and geopolitical developments. The S&P 500 edged toward record highs, buoyed by signs of cooling service-sector activity that reinforced expectations of further Fed rate cuts—though a hawkish tilt among new FOMC voters and internal divisions over inflation risks complicate the outlook. Commodities saw mixed movements, with copper surging to fresh records amid supply tightness, while oil prices rose on geopolitical tensions, particularly after President Trump’s intervention in Venezuela, which sparked energy sector gains. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia opened its stock market to all foreign investors, aiming to boost capital inflows, while China’s silver export restrictions and a rally driven by retail buyers underscored ongoing commodity volatility. Corporate developments included Reliance Industries’ sharp decline on retail sector concerns, Saks Global’s leadership shakeup amid bankruptcy rumors, and JPMorgan’s launch of a new advisory group to share strategic insights with clients. The Fed’s policy path remains a focal point, with Governor Stephen Miran advocating for over a percentage point in cuts this year, even as Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari signaled limited room for further easing.
