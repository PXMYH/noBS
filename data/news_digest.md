## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines this week with sweeping policy moves and geopolitical maneuvers. The Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over perceived bias and aligning it more closely with Defense Department oversight—a decision critics label as politically motivated. Meanwhile, the State Department indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for nationals from 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, a move that escalates tensions with key global players. On the energy front, Trump’s push to assert control over Venezuela’s oil reserves faces skepticism from major oil giants, who view domestic production as a more stable alternative, despite the administration’s aggressive posture. Internationally, Canada’s former central bank governor, Mark Carney, travels to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, signaling Ottawa’s pivot toward deeper economic ties amid worsening U.S.-China relations. In entertainment, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy steps down, marking a leadership shift in the *Star Wars* franchise as two studio veterans take the helm.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are reacting to a mix of corporate earnings, geopolitical tensions, and policy shifts as 2026 kicks off. President Trump’s economic proposals—including a potential 10% cap on credit card interest rates and uncertainty over the next Federal Reserve chair—are rattling financial stocks and bond markets, with bank executives pushing back against the rate cap idea. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk surged 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug, while European gas prices spiked 30% amid cold weather and supply concerns. In corporate news, PNC Financial hit a four-year high after beating revenue estimates, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported strong wealth management results, though broader bank earnings were mixed. The Fed’s independence remains a flashpoint, with officials warning that political interference could reignite inflation, while central banks globally continue stockpiling gold as a hedge against dollar volatility.
