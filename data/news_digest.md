## 🌍 World & Politics

Global geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate this week’s headlines, with President Trump’s policies taking center stage. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump’s keynote speech signals a retreat from the liberal democratic order, ceding economic leadership to China, while his threats of a new trade war raise concerns about long-term U.S. economic stability. Meanwhile, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, though Trump’s tariff authority remains under legal scrutiny. Internationally, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s announcement of upcoming trilateral peace talks with the U.S. and Russia sparks optimism, driving a decline in oil prices. Domestic unrest in the U.S. escalates as Minnesota prepares for an economic blackout protest against ICE operations, while Venezuela’s turn to cryptocurrency like USDT highlights growing distrust in unstable governments.

## ⚽ Sports

Venezuela is poised to debate a significant oil sector reform bill that could reshape its energy industry. The proposed legislation, set for discussion on Thursday, would permit private oil companies to market their own production, reduce tax burdens, and resolve disputes through international arbitration rather than Venezuelan courts. This move signals a potential shift toward greater private sector involvement in the country's oil industry, which has long been dominated by state control. The bill, if passed, could attract foreign investment and modernize Venezuela's oil operations, though it may also face political and regulatory hurdles. Analysts are watching closely to see how the debate unfolds and whether the reforms will gain traction amid Venezuela's ongoing economic challenges.
