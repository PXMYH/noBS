## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and domestic unrest dominate this week’s headlines, with the U.S. facing both internal and external challenges. In Minnesota, public outrage escalates as President Trump’s Border Patrol commander, Greg Bovino, prepares to withdraw agents following the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal officers. The move comes amid mass protests, including a statewide strike demanding ICE’s removal and an investigation into constitutional violations. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive trade policies remain in focus, with threats of a new trade war looming even as courts consider limiting his tariff authority. His administration also signals interest in U.S. investment in Venezuela, though sanctions continue to hinder economic engagement. Internationally, diplomatic strains intensify between China and Japan, with Chinese tourism to Japan plummeting after Tokyo’s remarks on potential military involvement in a Taiwan conflict. In Europe, the UK fines Bank of Scotland £160,000 for facilitating transactions for a sanctioned Putin ally, underscoring ongoing efforts to enforce sanctions against Russian elites. Malaysia, too, grapples with trade dilemmas, opting to review its controversial U.S. trade deal while cautioning against withdrawal despite domestic opposition.

## ⚽ Sports

The Washington Post reverses its initial decision to skip in-person coverage of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy, announcing it will now send a small team of reporters just weeks before the Games begin. The abrupt change follows widespread criticism of the paper's earlier plan to rely solely on remote reporting, underscoring the significance of on-the-ground journalism for major global events. Meanwhile, in golf, Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf continues its controversial partnership with former President Donald Trump's properties, confirming another tournament at a Trump Organization resort in New Jersey. This marks at least the sixth event hosted at Trump-owned venues since the breakaway league's inception, further cementing the alliance between the two entities. The move draws attention to the ongoing intersection of sports, politics, and business as LIV Golf expands its footprint in the U.S.
