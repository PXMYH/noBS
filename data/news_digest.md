## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvers dominate global headlines this week. In the Americas, U.S. President Donald Trump escalates pressure on Iran with a 25% tariff on countries trading with Tehran, amid ongoing protests in Iran that analysts say are unlikely to trigger regime change. Meanwhile, Trump pushes a controversial $100 billion plan to revive Venezuela’s oil sector, facing skepticism from major energy firms and criticism over potential economic fallout. China, already a dominant player in Latin America, watches these moves closely, while also flexing its diplomatic muscle by threatening to cancel UK trade talks after a British minister’s visit to Taiwan. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s potential snap election sparks market volatility, with stocks surging and bonds falling. Elsewhere, Ukrainian businesses, including a vodka exporter, defy wartime challenges by expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks.

## ⚽ Sports

Discount grocer Aldi is accelerating its U.S. expansion, announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to value-focused retailers. The aggressive growth underscores rising competition in the grocery sector, with discounters like Aldi gaining market share by attracting shoppers across income levels. The move reflects broader economic trends, as inflation and cost-of-living pressures push more households to prioritize affordability in their weekly shopping. Aldi's strategy includes modernizing stores and expanding its product offerings, further challenging traditional supermarkets and rival discount chains. The expansion could reshape the retail landscape, forcing competitors to adjust pricing and promotions to retain customers.
