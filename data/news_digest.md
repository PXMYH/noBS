{
    "summary": "Geopolitical tensions and economic shifts dominate global headlines this week. In East Asia, South Korea’s stock exchange plans to extend trading hours as its benchmark index surges toward President Lee Jae Myung’s ambitious 5,000-point target, reflecting robust market confidence. Meanwhile, Japan’s stock market hits record highs amid speculation that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call a snap election, signaling potential political volatility ahead. The yen and government bonds weaken as investors brace for possible policy changes, underscoring the interplay between politics and financial markets in the region.

On the energy front, President Trump’s aggressive push to revive Venezuela’s oil sector faces skepticism from major U.S. oil executives, who remain wary of the country’s political instability and economic risks. The move, part of a broader strategy to counter China’s deepening influence in Latin America, could exacerbate a global oil supply glut, further pressuring U.S. shale producers already grappling with four-year-low prices. Meanwhile, China’s dominance in the region looms large, with Beijing closely monitoring Trump’s maneuvers as it maintains its role as the leading lender and trading partner in Latin America. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff vodka expand exports despite ongoing Russian bombings, while diplomatic tensions flare after China threatened to cancel UK trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan, highlighting the fragile balance in international relations.",
