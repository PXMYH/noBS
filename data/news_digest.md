## 🌍 World & Politics

Global oil markets are experiencing volatility amid shifting geopolitical dynamics. Oil prices dip after President Donald Trump signals potential restraint in responding to Iran's crackdown on protesters, easing fears of a military escalation. Meanwhile, US crude trades at a significant discount to Brent as supply disruptions in Venezuela and the Black Sea reshape global energy flows. In diplomatic developments, Canada's Prime Minister sends former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as US economic ties with China deteriorate. Tensions between China and the UK also resurface after Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks following a British minister's visit to Taiwan earlier in the year. Elsewhere, Ukraine's resilience is on display as businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff push to expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, underscoring the country's determination to maintain economic activity amid war.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets are grappling with mixed signals as the U.S. economy shows resilience amid lingering inflation and policy uncertainty. The S&P 500 faces its first back-to-back loss of 2026 after lackluster economic data fails to shift Fed rate expectations, while a rotation out of tech stocks accelerates. Meanwhile, metals like gold, silver, and copper surge to record highs, driven by frenzied demand from China, even as global economic conflicts emerge as the top risk for businesses, according to the World Economic Forum. Corporate earnings paint a divided picture: Bank of America and Citigroup beat estimates, but expense concerns weigh on shares, while Intuitive Surgical warns of slower growth due to competition and funding cuts. The luxury retail sector takes a major hit as Saks Global, parent of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, files for bankruptcy under $3.4 billion in debt, marking one of the largest retail collapses in recent years. On the policy front, President Trump’s push to cap credit card interest rates sparks backlash from Wall Street, with banks warning of reduced access to credit, while his tariff policies face skepticism from economists despite his claims of economic strength. Central bank independence remains a flashpoint, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell drawing global support amid a criminal investigation and political pressure to cut rates.
