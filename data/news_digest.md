## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as US President Donald Trump's assertions over Greenland's sovereignty prompt European debate on potential economic countermeasures, though UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer advocates for diplomatic resolution, dismissing retaliatory tariffs as counterproductive. Meanwhile, Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward USDT stablecoins, reflecting broader distrust in volatile regimes, while Trump's self-declared authority over Venezuela's oil reserves raises skepticism among energy giants wary of political risks. In Europe, the European Central Bank begins its search for a new vice president, a precursor to future leadership transitions, as financial markets watch closely. Military activity in Latin America also draws attention, with the FAA issuing warnings to pilots over heightened risks near Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama, signaling regional security concerns.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face heightened volatility as trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and Europe, with President Trump's threats to annex Greenland and impose fresh tariffs rattling equities and boosting gold to record highs. Canadian stocks slide after a hotter-than-expected inflation report, while emerging markets in South Korea and Taiwan rebound amid currency gains. Meanwhile, central banks, including Brazil’s, push for stronger financial oversight, and the Federal Reserve’s independence comes under scrutiny as a DOJ investigation into Chair Jerome Powell complicates Trump’s efforts to reshape the Fed. Corporate earnings reveal mixed fortunes: Novo Nordisk surges on strong Wegovy sales, while Stellantis struggles with its turnaround, and Saks’ bankruptcy exposes risks in retail consolidation. In commodities, oil prices stabilize as geopolitical risks in the Middle East ease, but China’s real estate slump continues to weigh on growth despite export-driven resilience.
