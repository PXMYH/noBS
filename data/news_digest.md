## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration continues to reshape U.S. policy with bold moves on multiple fronts. Domestically, the Pentagon announces plans to overhaul *Stars and Stripes*, the independent military newspaper, citing concerns over its editorial direction and alignment with Trump’s policies. Meanwhile, the State Department indefinitely suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns—a decision likely to strain diplomatic relations. On the economic front, Morgan Stanley’s top fund pulls back from Brazilian and Colombian debt amid fiscal instability and looming presidential elections, signaling investor unease in Latin America. Internationally, former Bank of England governor Mark Carney travels to Beijing to repair Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S.-China tensions persist. In the energy sector, Trump’s push to exploit Venezuela’s oil faces skepticism from major U.S. oil companies, who favor domestic production over geopolitical risks.
