## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are facing renewed volatility as geopolitical tensions over Greenland and a sudden selloff in Japanese bonds disrupt the early-year calm. The standoff between the U.S. and Europe over Greenland has rattled equities, sent gold prices to record highs above $4,700 per ounce, and triggered a broader bond market rout, with Treasuries and Japanese debt yields surging. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve remains in focus as President Trump narrows his list of potential nominees to replace Chair Jerome Powell, whose leadership is under scrutiny amid a Justice Department investigation. Corporate activity is also making headlines, with Netflix securing a $42 billion bridge loan to finance its amended all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming business, while Saudi Arabia sets a January record by issuing over $20 billion in international bonds. In other developments, the ECB downplays the inflation impact of escalating trade tensions, and UK business liquidations hit a decade-high amid economic pressures. The week also saw Novo Nordisk shares surge 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug, while Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa vows 2026 will be a 'year of execution' for the automaker’s turnaround.
