## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S.-led capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which has sent shockwaves through global markets and diplomatic circles. The move, orchestrated by President Donald Trump, has triggered immediate economic repercussions, including a rally in U.S. oil stocks as Trump pledges to revive Venezuela’s energy sector. However, the ouster raises questions about the future of Venezuela’s oil production and China’s substantial financial stakes in the country, with Beijing’s billions in loans to Caracas now in limbo. The operation has also disrupted regional airspace, prompting flight cancellations in the Caribbean due to safety concerns. Meanwhile, tensions between China and Western nations persist, as Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister’s visit to Taiwan and imposed a ban on Japanese scallops in retaliation for Tokyo’s perceived support for Taiwan. Elsewhere, businesses in Ukraine continue to adapt amid ongoing conflict, with a major vodka exporter expanding exports despite wartime challenges. The broader implications of these events underscore a volatile geopolitical landscape, with energy markets, trade relations, and military operations all in flux.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets kicked off 2026 with resilience, shrugging off geopolitical tensions after the U.S. ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. U.S. stocks rose, led by tech and energy sectors, while gold and silver advanced on heightened risk sentiment. Copper surged to a record $13,000 per ton, driven by strong U.S. demand, though silver futures later retreated sharply from historic highs. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces internal divisions over further rate cuts, with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari suggesting limited need for deeper reductions. Corporate activity remained brisk: JPMorgan launched a new advisory group to share strategic insights with clients, while Apollo led a $1.2 billion investment in QXO. However, challenges persist—small manufacturers cite regulatory and labor pressures, and Saks Global’s CEO departure amid bankruptcy rumors underscores retail sector strains. Overseas, Saudi Arabia drew massive demand for its dollar bond sale, signaling strong investor appetite despite plans to ease issuance pace.
