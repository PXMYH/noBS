## 🌍 World & Politics

Global political and economic developments dominate headlines this week, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in the punishment of 69 high-ranking officials, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, with plans to temporarily suspend food sales taxes—a move likely tied to her upcoming election campaign. In the U.S., the Trump administration makes waves on multiple fronts: it halts immigrant visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns, while also asserting influence over Venezuela’s oil sector, though major energy firms remain hesitant to engage. The Pentagon’s decision to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, labeling it 'woke,' reflects broader efforts to align defense institutions with the administration’s policies. Additionally, the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador, hinting at rising regional tensions.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

{
    "summary": "Global markets are navigating a mix of economic and political crosscurrents as 2026 begins. Equity markets are charging into a high-stakes earnings season with optimism, as stocks rise across major indices from Tokyo to New York, though valuations remain elevated. Meanwhile, central banks are under scrutiny: the Bank of Japan’s upcoming meeting has yen traders on edge amid election uncertainty, while newly released 2020 Fed transcripts reveal Jerome Powell’s internal debates over rate guidance—a decision he later regretted. Powell is now facing political pressure from President Trump, who has threatened legal action against JPMorgan Chase over alleged debanking and revived a campaign promise to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move banks fiercely oppose. The Fed’s independence is further tested as Trump’s administration signals potential shake-ups, including delaying plans to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public.

    Corporate earnings paint a mixed picture: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs beat estimates, driven by wealth management and asset performance, while Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo fell short, partly due to looming regulatory risks. In M&A, Saks Global’s bankruptcy filing—just over a year after its acquisition of Neiman Marcus—highlights the perils of debt-fueled deals, drawing Amazon into a legal battle over its $475 million stake. Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk surges 8% on strong early sales of its Wegovy obesity drug, and Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 tourism push aims to diversify its oil-dependent economy. Geopolitical tensions flare as the EU threatens to halt a U.S. trade deal over Trump’s tariff threats, while central banks globally stockpile gold amid doubts about the dollar’s long-term stability.",

Discount grocery chain Aldi is accelerating its expansion in the U.S., announcing plans to open more than 180 new stores in 2026 as budget-conscious consumers increasingly turn to discounters for their weekly shopping.
