## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S. intervention in Venezuela and the ouster of Nicolás Maduro dominate global headlines, sparking intense debate over geopolitical and economic implications. The U.S. now effectively controls 40% of the world’s oil reserves, a move that reshapes energy markets and diplomatic leverage. While investors eye Venezuela’s $750 billion potential, analysts warn of risks tied to China’s debt claims, rule of law, and political instability. Meanwhile, China’s reaction to Maduro’s capture reveals internal divisions, with some viewing it as a template for Taiwan, while others caution against overreach. The fallout extends to trade tensions, as Beijing threatens to cancel UK trade talks over Taiwan and bans Japanese scallops in retaliation for perceived support of the island. Elsewhere, emerging markets rally despite geopolitical risks, and Ukraine’s war economy shows resilience as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports amid ongoing conflict. Domestically, the U.S. defunds the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, marking a shift in media policy under President Trump.
