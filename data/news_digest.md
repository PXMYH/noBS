## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions and economic maneuvering dominate global headlines this week, with President Trump's aggressive push into Venezuela's oil sector drawing widespread scrutiny. Despite Trump's efforts to rally U.S. oil executives behind a $100 billion investment plan, major firms remain hesitant due to political instability and legal risks. Analysts warn that Trump's strategy—seen by critics as outdated and exploitative—could weaken U.S. economic influence while bolstering China's already dominant position in Latin America. Meanwhile, Greenland's labor leaders firmly reject Trump's annexation claims, underscoring growing resistance to U.S. expansionist rhetoric. In other developments, Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and China's threat to cancel UK trade talks over a minister's Taiwan visit highlights Beijing's escalating diplomatic pressure. Against this backdrop, Ukraine's resilience shines as businesses like Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing war, while financial markets grapple with the fallout from Trump's Venezuela gambit.
