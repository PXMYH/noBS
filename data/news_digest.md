## 🌍 World & Politics

The Trump administration dominates headlines with aggressive moves on Venezuela, seizing control of its oil sales and detaining President Nicolás Maduro in a bold geopolitical play. The U.S. has seized two tankers, including a Russian-flagged vessel, as part of a broader effort to redirect Venezuela’s oil to American markets, a shift that rattles global energy markets and strains relations with China, which holds billions in Venezuelan debt. Meanwhile, Mexico pledges to continue oil shipments to Cuba as humanitarian aid, defying U.S. pressure, while Canada’s oil prices tumble amid the disruption. Domestically, Trump pushes Congress to block Wall Street from buying single-family homes and vows to crack down on defense contractors over executive pay, even as he proposes a record $1.5 trillion military budget. The fallout from Maduro’s capture sparks debates in China over Taiwan parallels, while the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on despite wartime challenges, and the U.K. faces trade tensions with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit.
