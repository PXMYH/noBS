## 🌍 World & Politics

Global oil markets fluctuate amid geopolitical tensions, with crude prices falling after U.S. President Donald Trump signals a potential pause in military action against Iran following assurances that Tehran will halt its crackdown on protesters. The shift eases earlier fears of escalation, though regional supply disruptions—including developments in Venezuela and the Black Sea—continue to widen the discount of U.S. oil to the Brent benchmark. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts intensify as Canada’s Prime Minister sends former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to Beijing to repair strained Canada-China relations, seeking new trade opportunities as U.S. economic ties with China deteriorate. In Europe, Ukraine’s resilience shines as businesses like vodka producer Nemiroff expand exports despite ongoing Russian attacks, while earlier tensions between the UK and China resurface after revelations that Beijing threatened to cancel trade talks over a British minister’s visit to Taiwan.
