## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions escalate as the U.S. consolidates control over Venezuela’s oil sector following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro, with President Trump pushing for private investment despite skepticism from major oil executives. The move strains relations with Mexico, which defies U.S. pressure by delivering oil to Cuba, while hedge funds grow bullish on crude amid supply concerns tied to Venezuela and Iran’s unrest. Meanwhile, China watches Washington’s Latin America strategy closely, having already established deep economic ties in the region. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and the UK faces diplomatic fallout with Beijing after a minister’s Taiwan visit nearly derailed trade talks. Domestic U.S. politics see Trump targeting defense contractors for delays and calling for housing market reforms to curb corporate homebuying.
