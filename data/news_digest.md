## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are bracing for volatility as investors await the U.S. jobs report and a potential Supreme Court ruling on President Trump’s tariffs, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path. The dollar and Treasury yields rise amid uncertainty, while stocks waver. Meanwhile, corporate earnings reveal mixed signals: General Motors posts a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back EV ambitions, and Reliance Industries loses $15 billion in market cap due to weak retail outlooks and geopolitical pressures. Mergers and IPOs are also making headlines, with Rio Tinto reportedly open to acquiring Glencore’s coal business in a potential mega-deal, and Chinese AI startup MiniMax surging in its Hong Kong debut. Energy markets remain in focus as Trump’s plans to leverage Venezuela’s oil reserves aim to drive prices down to $50 a barrel, though experts question the feasibility. Elsewhere, India’s economy faces risks from higher tariffs and Chinese competition, while South Korea advances its bid for developed-market status with 24-hour FX trading.
