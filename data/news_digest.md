## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend has triggered a major geopolitical shift, with Washington asserting control over Venezuela’s oil sales indefinitely. The Trump administration has intensified its blockade of Venezuelan oil, seizing Russian-flagged tankers and pursuing talks with oil companies to revive the country’s shattered industry. Mexico has pledged to continue supplying Cuba with crude oil as humanitarian aid, while China faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Caracas. The move has sparked debates in China about political power and Taiwan, with some viewing Maduro’s capture as a potential blueprint for future actions. Meanwhile, domestic developments include the dissolution of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after federal funding cuts, and airlines canceling flights due to U.S. airspace restrictions over the Caribbean amid the Venezuela operation.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets remain buoyant as US stocks hover near record highs, buoyed by falling bond yields and investor optimism despite mixed economic signals. The energy sector surges 2.7% on bets tied to Venezuela’s political upheaval, with the US now marketing Venezuelan crude globally—a move complicating oil firms’ claims for billions in past asset seizures. Meanwhile, the Fed faces mounting political pressure, with its independence tested as Trump seeks to reshape the central bank amid a tight split over recent rate cuts. Corporate activity highlights include Medline’s record IPO, surging 40% in the largest private-equity-backed debut, and GameStop’s ambitious $100 billion market-cap target for CEO Ryan Cohen. However, distress signals flash in retail, with Saks Global teetering toward bankruptcy and First Brands warning of a cash crunch by month’s end. Commodities see volatility as copper retreats from record highs, while gold and silver miners ramp up share sales amid rallying prices. Geopolitical risks linger, with Wall Street chasing Venezuelan assets post-Maduro, though experts caution over unresolved debt and legal hurdles.
