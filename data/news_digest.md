## 🌍 World & Politics

The sudden U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro dominates global headlines, triggering geopolitical and economic shockwaves. The move, orchestrated under President Trump, has prompted uncertainty over Venezuela’s oil industry—home to vast reserves but currently producing just one million barrels daily—and raised questions about the future of China’s multibillion-dollar oil deals with Caracas. Delcy Rodríguez, now acting president, faces pressure to stabilize the economy, though investors like Michael Burry and Hans Humes express cautious optimism about Venezuela’s potential revival. Meanwhile, the U.S. has closed Caribbean airspace, citing safety risks, disrupting flights as tensions escalate. Beyond Venezuela, China’s diplomatic tensions flare after the UK’s Taiwan visit led Beijing to threaten canceling trade talks, while Japan faces economic retaliation over its Taiwan stance, including a ban on scallop imports. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s businesses, like vodka maker Nemiroff, press on amid wartime challenges, and global markets react to the shifting energy landscape as oil prices edge up on Venezuelan instability.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Markets kicked off 2026 with a bullish tone, as U.S. stocks rose on optimism around earnings growth, potential Fed rate cuts, and resilience to geopolitical risks, including Venezuela’s leadership upheaval. Energy stocks surged 2.9% amid bets on increased Venezuelan crude supply, while copper hit a record $13,000 per ton, driven by strong U.S. demand. Treasuries gained as weak manufacturing data and bullish options trades fueled expectations of lower yields, though Fed officials remained divided on further rate cuts. Corporate activity remained brisk, with Apollo leading a $1.2 billion investment in QXO and JPMorgan launching a new advisory group to share strategic insights with clients. Meanwhile, high-grade bond issuance saw its busiest day since September, and Saudi Arabia drew $29 billion in demand for its latest dollar bond sale, signaling robust appetite for debt despite the kingdom’s plans to slow borrowing. In retail, Saks Global’s CEO stepped down as the luxury retailer faces bankruptcy, while Warren Buffett’s exit from Berkshire Hathaway marked a leadership shift. Analysts caution that while AI-driven tech rallies and dealmaking buoy markets, risks from inflation, valuation bubbles, and policy uncertainty loom.
