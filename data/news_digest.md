## 🌍 World & Politics

The U.S. intervention in Venezuela dominates global headlines, with President Trump's administration seizing two oil tankers and claiming control over Venezuelan oil reserves, though Caracas denies finalizing any deal. The operation has sparked geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, which faces uncertainty over billions in loans to Venezuela and debates internally whether the crisis offers a template for Taiwan. Meanwhile, the U.S. closes Caribbean airspace, disrupting flights, while Democratic lawmakers call for an investigation into Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. In Ukraine, businesses like Nemiroff vodka press on despite wartime challenges, signaling resilience amid ongoing conflict. The Venezuela crisis also divides Trump's MAGA media base, with some backing intervention despite past anti-war stances, while investors like Michael Burry position for long-term gains in the oil sector.

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions, corporate shifts, and economic policy moves. Oil prices climb as traders weigh risks tied to Iran and Venezuela, where the U.S. is asserting control over the country’s crude reserves in a bid to lower domestic energy costs.

Corporate activity is heating up, with Rio Tinto in talks to acquire Glencore in a $200 billion mining megadeal, while General Motors reports a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions. In Asia, Chinese consumer prices show a rebound, but deflationary risks linger amid weak stimulus, and MiniMax’s AI startup surges 54% in its Hong Kong IPO debut. The Fed’s independence faces scrutiny as political pressures mount, while JPMorgan Chase takes over the Apple Card from Goldman Sachs, marking a shift in consumer finance strategies.

## ⚽ Sports

Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is making waves off the court by advocating for NBA players to gain equity stakes in teams, arguing that current labor rules fail to reflect the league's massive financial growth. In an interview with Brooke Sutherland, the four-time All-Star and Finals MVP highlights the disparity between player contributions and ownership rewards, framing it as a broader issue of economic justice in professional sports. Brown, known for his entrepreneurial ventures and philanthropy, suggests that players should share in the long-term value they help create, a stance that could spark broader discussions about revenue sharing and labor rights in the NBA. His comments come as the league continues to see record-breaking valuations and media deals, raising questions about how wealth is distributed among stakeholders.

## 📰 Other News

The first week of 2026 reveals a mixed economic landscape, with signs of resilience in some sectors and lingering challenges for workers. Major Indian IT firms like TCS and Infosys are set to provide early insights into corporate demand for the year, while Ford reports its strongest U.S. vehicle sales since 2019, signaling recovery in the auto industry. However, economic strain persists as more Americans remain stuck in part-time jobs or juggle multiple gigs to cover rising costs, despite minimum wage increases in several states. The housing market shows slight improvements in affordability, though high down payments continue to deter buyers, particularly in disaster-prone areas where climate risks are reshaping real estate values. Meanwhile, political and legal tensions escalate, with the House voting to subpoena a journalist over alleged leaks about a Delta Force operation in Venezuela, and multiple states suing the Trump administration over a controversial $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. Cultural shifts are also notable, as travel loyalty programs ramp up exclusive perks to retain fickle customers, and Gen Z’s fitness trends prompt Planet Fitness to emphasize its 'judgment-free' approach to strength training. The Supreme Court’s growing favoritism toward wealthy litigants, as highlighted in a new economic study, underscores broader debates about inequality and institutional bias.
