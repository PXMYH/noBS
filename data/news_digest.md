## 🌍 World & Politics

Global economic and political tensions dominate headlines as President Trump's policies continue to reshape international relations. At the World Economic Forum, Trump's keynote speech signals a further retreat from the liberal democratic order, ceding ground to China, which is increasingly seen as a leader in the global economy. Meanwhile, Trump's threats of a new trade war loom, even as U.S. courts consider curbing his tariff authority. Economists warn his first-year policies, though initially inconsequential, may weaken the U.S. economy long-term. Domestically, Congress averts a government shutdown with a bipartisan funding deal, but protests erupt in Minnesota over federal immigration enforcement, highlighting deep divisions. In Asia, Japan's bond market stabilizes after a selloff triggered by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's tax-cut proposals, while Venezuela's economic instability drives locals toward cryptocurrency like USDT for financial security. These developments underscore shifting power dynamics and growing instability in both economic and political spheres.
