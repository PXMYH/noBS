## 🌍 World & Politics

Geopolitical tensions dominate global headlines as the Trump administration intensifies its focus on Venezuela’s oil reserves, pushing for U.S. investment despite skepticism from major oil executives. The U.S. claims an agreement with Venezuela’s government to secure millions of barrels, though details remain unclear, while Mexico’s oil shipment to Cuba further strains U.S.-Latin America relations. Meanwhile, China asserts its influence in the region, closely monitoring U.S. moves as it maintains its role as Latin America’s top trading partner. Elsewhere, Greenland’s labor leader rejects Trump’s annexation claims, and the UK faces diplomatic fallout with China after a minister’s Taiwan visit. Domestic U.S. politics see Trump pressing Congress to curb Wall Street’s single-family home purchases and targeting defense contractors over delays. In Ukraine, businesses like Nemiroff Vodka adapt to wartime challenges, expanding exports despite ongoing conflict.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are showing mixed signals in early 2026, with U.S. stocks lagging behind international peers despite a strong 2025 driven by AI optimism. Investors are diversifying away from U.S. assets, while defense stocks in Europe and Asia surge amid geopolitical tensions. Gold remains a favored safe haven after its record 2025 rally, though analysts caution against expecting a repeat performance. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve maintains a cautious stance on rate cuts, awaiting clearer signs of rising unemployment, even as December’s jobs data suggests a cooling labor market. Corporate earnings reveal struggles in key sectors, with General Motors posting a $7.1 billion loss after scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions, while Volkswagen faces steep declines in U.S. sales due to tariffs and expired EV tax credits. Mergers and acquisitions are heating up, particularly in mining, where Rio Tinto and Glencore restart talks on a potential $260 billion merger that could create the world’s largest mining company. In policy moves, President Trump orders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to boost housing affordability, a controversial step reminiscent of pre-2008 risks. Venezuela’s oil sector is back in focus as Trump seeks to leverage its reserves to drive down U.S. oil prices to $50 a barrel, though oil executives remain skeptical about the country’s investability without major reforms.
