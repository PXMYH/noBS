## 🌍 World & Politics

The most significant geopolitical development this week is the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The raid, followed by Maduro's detention in New York, marks a dramatic escalation in U.S. intervention in the region. President Trump has declared that the U.S. will temporarily administer Venezuela until a transition can be arranged, while also pledging American oil companies will rebuild the country's struggling petroleum infrastructure. Despite the geopolitical shock, oil markets remain largely unaffected, with analysts suggesting global supplies can absorb any potential disruptions. The move has triggered financial reactions, including a surge in Venezuelan bonds and a drop in Saudi stocks amid broader geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, China continues to assert its influence, threatening to cancel trade talks with the UK over a minister's visit to Taiwan and using economic measures like a scallop ban to pressure Japan. Elsewhere, Ukrainian businesses, including a major vodka exporter, demonstrate resilience by expanding exports despite ongoing Russian attacks.

## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets enter 2026 with cautious optimism as investors weigh the sustainability of last year’s tech-driven rally against lingering economic uncertainties. The Federal Reserve faces a divided path forward, with Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson signaling potential rate cuts later in the year, though minutes from the December meeting reveal deep internal splits over inflation and unemployment risks. Meanwhile, the AI boom continues to fuel corporate borrowing and bond trading, though concerns persist about an AI bubble and its broader economic impact. OPEC+ maintains steady oil output amid geopolitical turmoil, while emerging-market bonds show resilience as local investors dominate holdings. On the corporate front, Saks Global’s leadership shakeup and potential bankruptcy underscore retail sector struggles, while SpaceX’s anticipated IPO looms as a major market event. Central banks, including the Czech Republic’s, emphasize tight monetary policies to combat inflation, even as Saudi Arabia signals a slowdown in bond issuance after years of rapid borrowing.

## 💻 Technology

The tech and business landscape in early 2026 is marked by significant shifts in global markets, regulatory challenges, and evolving consumer trends. China's BYD has overtaken Tesla as the world's largest electric carmaker, reflecting the broader slowdown in EV growth as automakers pivot back to gas-powered trucks and SUVs amid policy-driven demand. Meanwhile, AI continues to dominate investor attention, with Asian stocks facing potential headwinds from fears of an AI bubble and diverging regional interest rates. Regulatory pressures are intensifying, as China cracks down on AI chatbots over content risks, while the U.S. sees legal challenges from offshore wind developers like Ørsted over suspended projects. In corporate news, Uber rewrites driver contracts to avoid UK taxes, and Paramount secures Larry Ellison's backing in its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, signaling ongoing consolidation in media. The energy sector remains volatile, with OPEC+ holding supply steady amid geopolitical turmoil, including the U.S. capture of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, which has sent shockwaves through oil markets and global diplomacy.
