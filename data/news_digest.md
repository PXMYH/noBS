## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets are navigating a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic shifts, with President Trump's unpredictable trade policies continuing to dominate headlines. After initially threatening tariffs on European nations over Greenland, Trump abruptly reversed course, sparking a relief rally in U.S. and European stocks—a phenomenon traders are calling the 'Trump Always Chickens Out' (TACO) effect. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and other central banks are holding interest rates steady amid lingering inflation concerns, with the Fed's independence under scrutiny as Trump escalates pressure on Chair Jerome Powell. In corporate news, SpaceX is preparing for a potential blockbuster IPO, while Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of fintech startup Brex underscores ongoing consolidation in financial services. China's stock market is diverging sharply, with industrial exporters thriving while consumer-facing firms struggle, reflecting broader economic imbalances. Energy markets are stabilizing as Kazakh oil flows resume, though geopolitical risks persist, particularly around U.S. involvement in Venezuela's oil sales.
