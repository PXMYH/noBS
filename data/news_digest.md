## 🌍 World & Politics

Global financial and political tensions dominate headlines as Japan faces economic instability ahead of a snap election, with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warning of intervention amid a weakening yen and surging bond yields. In the U.S., Democrats threaten a government shutdown over funding for the Department of Homeland Security, while President Trump escalates trade threats, vowing a 100% tariff on Canadian imports if Ottawa strikes a deal with China. Meanwhile, China gains ground as Trump renounces U.S. leadership in global economic governance, further straining relations with allies like Japan, where Chinese tourism plummets amid disputes over Taiwan. The UK also tightens trade policies, reducing tariff-free steel imports to counter a global glut driven by Chinese production. Domestic unrest in the U.S. intensifies as Minnesotans stage mass protests against ICE operations, adding pressure to an already volatile political landscape.

The U.S. economy shows resilience in small business optimism and consumer spending, though inflation remains sticky at 2.8%. Meanwhile, corporate activity is brisk: Capital One's $5.15 billion acquisition of Brex and SpaceX's potential $800 billion IPO highlight dealmaking momentum, while Trump's trade policies and legal battles with JPMorgan add volatility. In Asia, China's stock market splits between industrial exporters and struggling consumer sectors, and Saudi Arabia's property market opens further to foreign investors, signaling regional economic diversification efforts.
