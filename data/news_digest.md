## 💰 Finance, Economics & Business

Global markets face renewed volatility as President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies, including proposed tariffs on European nations over Greenland and a push to acquire the territory, rattle investors. Stock futures in Europe and the U.S. decline, while safe-haven assets like gold and silver surge to record highs. The dollar weakens amid policy uncertainty, and commodities like oil and iron ore fluctuate on geopolitical tensions and oversupply concerns. Meanwhile, China's economy grows 5% in 2025, driven by robust exports, though momentum weakens as a real estate crash weighs on domestic demand. Corporate earnings reveal mixed results: HDFC Bank posts strong loan growth, while major U.S. banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America struggle with regulatory pressures and Trump's proposed credit card rate caps. In other developments, Novo Nordisk shares jump 8% on strong sales of its obesity drug Wegovy, and Coinbase flexes its political influence by blocking a Senate crypto bill. Central banks globally continue stockpiling gold as a hedge against dollar instability, reflecting broader economic unease.
