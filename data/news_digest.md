Global political and economic developments dominate this week's headlines, with significant actions from major powers shaping international relations. In China, an intensified anti-corruption campaign results in the punishment of 69 high-ranking officials, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft within the ruling elite. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares for a potential parliamentary dissolution, considering a temporary suspension of food sales tax—a move tied to her election campaign promises.
