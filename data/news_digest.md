{
    "summary": "Geopolitical tensions and domestic political shifts dominate global headlines this week. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces mounting pressure amid a corruption scandal, prompting outreach to potential rivals as calls for elections grow louder. Meanwhile, China intensifies its anti-corruption drive, punishing 69 high-ranking officials in 2025, signaling President Xi Jinping's continued crackdown on graft. In Japan, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi prepares to dissolve parliament, with plans to suspend food sales taxes as part of her re-election strategy, reflecting economic concerns ahead of a pivotal vote.

On the international stage, the U.S. tightens immigration policies, halting visa processing for 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, and Russia, citing welfare concerns. The Pentagon also moves to overhaul the independent military newspaper *Stars and Stripes*, alleging ideological bias, while the FAA issues warnings about military activity in Latin American airspace, urging caution for flights over the Pacific near Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador. Venezuela, under Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, secures its first LPG export deal, though U.S. oil giants remain hesitant to engage despite Trump's push for Venezuelan energy ties. Domestically, former President Trump's financial moves—including a $1 million bond purchase in Netflix and Warner Bros.—raise eyebrows amid his ongoing influence over media and economic policies.",
